    "body": "4 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesL-R: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sarah Ferguson and Ehud BarakThe list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. Elon MuskThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\". Bill GatesTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.\"Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Donald TrumpThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoingRichard BransonRichard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"Virgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".The statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"Sarah Ferguson Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.Lord MandelsonEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\". Epstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I'm not there\".Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.Steve Bannon The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Miroslav LajčákAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.Watch: 'Do you think you're the devil himself?' Epstein questioned in newly released interviewHoward LutnickBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Larry SummersLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. \"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve TischSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".Brett RatnerThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.US Department of JusticeBrett Ratner is seen on the right here alongside Jeffrey Epstein and two women Peter AttiaThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".Casey WassermanThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.Response: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\" Sergey BrinSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.Ehud BarakFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment.Brad KarpBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Bill ClintonIn the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,\" he said.In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. \"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"Deepak ChopraThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love\"In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: \"Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.\"Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: \"God is a construct. Cute girls are real.\"Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: \"Did you find me a cute Israeli?\"Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was \"deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case\" and denied his involvement in \"any criminal or exploitative conduct.\"\"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.\"The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.",

Also likely to be competing are reigning world and Olympic champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's US-born superstar Eileen Gu and Italian teenager Flora Tabanelli, the current Youth Olympic champion who has stepped up seamlessly to elite level.Alpine skiing: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50)The first medals of these Olympics could quite feasibly all go the way of Switzerland. Back-to-back World Cup champion Marco Odermatt will start as slight favourite ahead of compatriot and 2025 world champion Franjo von Allmen. Another Swiss star, Alexis Monney, will head to the Games as Stelvio's most recent World Cup downhill winner – could he, ahem, cash in on gold ahead of his team-mates? Austria's Vincent Kriechmayr will have something to say about that, while Giovanni Franzoni, who won the recent Kitzbuhel downhill and veteran Dominik Paris, 36, will carry the weight of expectation for the host nation.Snowboard: Men's big air (18:30-19:50)Twelve of the world's top snowboarders will be showing off their tricks in one of the most spectacular sports on the Winter Olympic programme. It looks like an open competition but Japan's team is full of talent, including reigning world champion Ryoma Kimata and overall World Cup winner Taiga Hasegawa.Good to knowMixed doubles curling round robin matches continue. There's no rest for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, who are in action twice today for the third day running. At 09:05 they face Canada's husband-and-wife pair Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman. Then at 13:35 they're up against 2023 world champions Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse of the USA, who are making their Olympic debut.Men's freeski slopestyle qualifying starts at 13:00, with defending Olympic champion and 2024–25 World Cup winner Alex Hall of the USA looking like the man to beat.Day two: Sunday, 8 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50); Men's cross-country 10km skiathlon (11:30-13:00); Men's and women's snowboard parallel giant slalom (12:00-13:40); Biathlon – mixed relay  (13:05-14:40); Men's speed skating 5000m (15:00-17:20); Men's luge (16:00-19:40); Team figure skating (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Parallel giant slalom (08:00-14:00)Czech superstar Ester Ledecka takes aim at an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic gold in the women's parallel giant slalom. Ledecka made history in 2018 by becoming the first woman to win gold medals in two different sports by also winning the alpine skiing Super-G, and she could repeat the feat at these Games. Meanwhile, Austria's Claudia Riegler is set to become the oldest woman to compete at the Winter Olympics at the age of 52. Hosts Italy have several big hopes in the men's event, including reigning world champion Roland Fischnaller, who will be competing in his seventh Winter Olympics at the age of 45.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vonn made her Olympic debut aged 17 in Salt Lake City in 2002Alpine skiing: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50)This race marks the return of legendary American skier Lindsey Vonn, six years after her retirement from the sport. Downhill is the 41-year-old's speciality and she's won a record 45 World Cup races in this event, plus her only Olympic gold medal in 2010.We will have to see how much of an affect crashing in the final World Cup downhill before the Winter Olympics hinders Vonn's bid.  Keep an eye out for her superbly-named compatriot Breezy Johnson, who is the 2025 world champion. The host nation will be hopeful of at least one podium place, although World Cup champion Federica Brignone only returned to action in January, nine months after breaking multiple bones in her left leg and tearing her ACL during a giant slalom crash at the Italian Championships. Bergamo native Sofia Goggia took downhill silver four years ago despite suffering a knee injury just 23 days before the event.Cross country skiing: Men's skiathlon (11:30-12:50)It's a fifth Winter Olympics for Britain's Andrew Musgrave, whose best Olympic result is seventh in the skiathlon in 2018. In this event, competitors complete 10km using the classical technique before changing skis and doing 10km using the freestyle technique. Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the world champion and this could be the first of a bobble-hatful of golds for the Norwegian at these Games.Snowboard: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Mia Brookes has every chance of becoming Britain's youngest Winter Olympic medallist for 78 years. The rider from Cheshire has just turned 19 but has already won back-to-back big air World Cup titles and comes to Italy fresh from winning medals in the X Games. But she will face a stacked field, including Japan's Kokomo Murase, Reira Iwabuchi and Mari Fukada, who formed a clean sweep of the medals at last year's World Championships. Austria's Anna Gasser is aiming to win the event for the third Games in a row at the age of 34. Maisie Hill, whose career was almost ended by a horrific training accident three years ago, will be Britain's other representative.Figure skating: Team (20:55)The team figure skating competition concludes with the men's free skate. The USA won gold after the Russian team was demoted in Beijing in a protracted saga that delayed the medal ceremony by over two years. The USA are the reigning World Team Trophy champions and won three of the four individual events at last year's World Championships but Japan and Georgia will be pushing them hard.Good to knowMixed doubles curling continues with another double-header for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in their final matches of the round robin stage. First up at 13:35 is Switzerland's husband-and-wife duo of Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-Hürlimann. Then at 18:05 there will be a big clash with home favourites and reigning Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini. It's a repeat of last year's World Championships final, which the Italians won.Day three: Monday, 9 FebruaryMedals: FiveMedal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)Newly-crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, will be hoping to have reached the final for a second consecutive Games. The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli.Figure skating: Ice dance – rhythm dance (18:20-2200)Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. The omens are good for the British pair – last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez.Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick – and an Olympic medal – in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix.Good to knowThe curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 – Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today.Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question – their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria.Day four: Tuesday, 10 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud – who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhoodAlpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  – Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy.Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.Good to knowMost athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) – another Olympic medal would be her 12th.Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) – and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz.Day five: Wednesday, 11 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by – the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final.Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022.Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15).Day six: Thursday, 12 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).Daily highlightsSkeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)This event promises to be one of the most entertaining – and open – of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final – which they lost – against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05).Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA – who haven't lifted the title since 1980 – face Latvia at 20:10.The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again.The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05.

She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "2 hours agoScott AdamandAlicia CurryGetty ImagesIn 2014, Lord Rennard apologised if he had \"inadvertently encroached\" upon \"personal space\"Lord Rennard has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats after the party launched a fresh investigation into claims he sexually harassed female members. A Lib Dem spokesperson said the party \"has now received legal advice\" that a 2013 inquiry into the allegations \"was flawed in several respects\".Harassment claims were made against the peer in 2013, but in 2014 a barrister appointed by the party to investigate the allegations concluded that whilst the accounts of the four women were \"broadly credible,\" they could not be proved beyond reasonable doubt. In a statement, Lord Rennard referred to the Met Police investigation and several independent reviews, which he said concluded \"no further action\" needed to be taken.Lord Rennard has previously apologised if he had \"inadvertently encroached\" upon \"personal space\".The Lib Dem spokesperson added party leader Sir Ed Davey believes \"Rennard should not be a member of the House of Lords\" and \"that it should be made easier for peers to be expelled from the Lords for serious misconduct\". In 2013, Lord Rennard, a former party chief executive, was accused by four women of abusing his position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them. The party's internal inquiry found that there should be no further action against Lord Rennard but requested he apologised. He initially refused but later expressed regret.The Metropolitan Police also found there was \"insufficient evidence\" to prosecute the peer over allegations of sexual touchingLord Rennard subsequently challenged his suspension from the Lib Dems, saying it was against party rules. It was eventually lifted after disciplinary proceedings against him were dropped and the party said this brought \"the matter to a close\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentUK ParliamentJosh Simons said he had asked the firm to look into a \"suspected illegal hack\" which was unrelated to any UK journalistA government minister employed a PR and lobbying firm to investigate journalists' sources before he entered Parliament.Cabinet office minister Josh Simons was chief executive of the pro-Starmer think-tank Labour Together and in 2023 commissioned APCO Worldwide to try and identify how reporters had uncovered information about the group's funding.In a contract for the work seen by the BBC, APCO Worldwide confirmed it would \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins of a Sunday Times article about Labour Together\" as well as upcoming works by two political authors.The allegations, first reported by investigative website Democracy for Sale, centre on how Labour Together responded to media reports about the think tank's failure to declare more than £700,000 in donations between 2017 and 2020.Labour Together was fined £14,250 by the Electoral Commission in September 2021 over late reporting of donations.Josh Simons said it was \"nonsense\" to claim he wanted to investigate journalists and he had asked APCO Worldwide to \"look into a suspected illegal hack, which had nothing to do with UK journalists at Sunday Times, Guardian or any other brilliant UK newspaper\".\"APCO's investigation never fully got to the bottom of this,\" he wrote on X. \"Those who know me know I think the work of journalists is vital to our democracy.\"Labour Together and ACPO Worldwide have not responded to requests for comment. A government source said: \"We are looking into the claims\".The think tank is alleged to have hired journalist-turned-lobbyist Tom Harper from APCO Worldwide to investigate reporting by The Sunday Times and other outlets to identify their sources. Harper has not responded to a request for comment.In the leaked contract, APCO Worldwide said it intended to \"establish who and what are behind the coordinated attacks on Labour Together\".The firm said it would use open source, human intelligence and digital forensics work and its approach should \"provide a body of evidence that could be packaged up for use in the media in order to create narratives that would proactively undermine any future attacks on Labour Together\".Before Simons led Labour Together, it was run by Morgan McSweeney who is now Keir Starmer's chief of staff.The BBC has reached out to Morgan McSweeney for comment. A source close to McSweeney pointed out he was not running Labour Together at the time APCO's investigation was commissioned.",

    "body": "7 hours agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterGetty ImagesOfficers arrived at one of the addresses linked to Lord Mandelson in central LondonTwo properties linked to Peter Mandelson in Wiltshire and north London have been searched following allegations of misconduct in public office, the Metropolitan Police has said.The force launched an investigation into the ex-Labour minister on Tuesday after suggestions he passed on market-sensitive government information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said: \"He has not been arrested and enquiries are ongoing.\"Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He has previously expressed his regret for his continued association with Epstein and apologised \"unequivocally to the women and the girls who suffered\".The BBC understands Lord Mandelson, 72, was at his address near Camden when police began the search.Officers were seen briefly searching a car outside the property before returning inside and leaving the building carrying several boxes.Lord Mandelson was able to arrange for police to enter the Wiltshire address without force.Police entered the property carrying unfolded archive boxes and also investigating outhouses.Watch: Police carry out searches at properties linked to MandelsonAccusations that Lord Mandelson, as a government minister, leaked information to Epstein came after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents including emails to and from the US financier. Messages from 2008 appear to show Lord Mandelson - who was at the time business secretary in Gordon Brown's government - discussing Treasury plans for a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses with Epstein.Two days after Lord Mandelson and Epstein exchanged emails about the bankers' bonus policy, the documents suggest they had further conversations about the plan.An email from Epstein asks if \"jamie\" should call then-Chancellor Alistair Darling \"one more time\".That appears to be a reference to Jamie Dimon, who was chief executive of US banking giant JP Morgan at the time.Lord Mandelson appears to have replied to Epstein saying he should call the chancellor again, before suggesting he should \"mildly threaten\" him.Other emails indicate that Lord Mandelson gave advanced notice to Epstein of a €500bn bailout from the EU to save the Euro.The UK did not contribute to the bailout, but Mr Darling was present in Brussels for the negotiations.After the police launched their investigation, a UK government spokesperson said: \"The government stands ready to provide whatever support and assistance the police need.\"The offence of misconduct in public office often applies to those in public service roles such as civil servants or police officers and carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 'Incredible misjudgement'On Wednesday, in the face of a threatened rebellion by Labour MPs, Downing Street promised to release documents relating to its appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US.The BBC has been told that the number of documents, which covers all electronic communications, could be close to 100,000.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer  in a letter to the Intelligence and Security Committee on Friday warned a \"very significant volume of material\" will likely need to be reviewed but said it is important that the documents are made available to Parliament \"as soon as possible\".Publication of the files could take some time after the government asked to withhold some of the material for national security reasons and the Metropolitan Police made a similar request to reduce any interference with its criminal investigation.Sir Keir has previously apologised to Epstein's victims saying he was \"sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies\".Former Prime Minister Brown said he \"greatly regrets\" appointing Mandelson in his government. \"As I digest the details of what has emerged, I also find it hard to find words to express my revulsion at what has been uncovered about Epstein and his impact on our politics,\" he wrote in the Guardian on Friday.Brown added that he takes \"personal responsibility\" for Lord Mandelson's appointment but said he was informed that his record was \"unblemished\" and there were \"no reports of a relationship with anyone named Epstein\".Labour MPs have publicly and privately been expressing their anger at the alleged actions of Lord Mandelson but also at the prime minister for having appointed him as the UK's ambassador. Liverpool Riverside MP Kim Johnson told BBC Radio Merseyside Sir Keir had handled the situation \"appallingly\" and he should \"consider resigning\".Brian Leishman, MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, told the BBC Sir Keir had \"shown an incredible misjudgement in appointing Lord Mandelson and it goes beyond saying sorry\".\"Has his judgment been good enough for that office? I think the answer is a categorical no,\" he added.Stroud MP Simon Opher said the prime minister \"needs to change his advisers in Number 10\".He suggested chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Lord Mandelson, should go over the scandal.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said Sir Keir's position was \"untenable\" and called for a vote of no confidence. On Sunday, Lord Mandelson quit the Labour party and three days later retired from the House of Lords. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoYang TianPembrokeshire HeraldA 15-year-old boy who allegedly assaulted a teacher has been charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm and possession of a bladed article on education premises.Dyfed-Powys Police were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire, south-west Wales on Thursday afternoon following reports of an assault of a teacher by a pupil brandishing a weapon.The teacher has since been discharged from hospital, police said, adding they were \"continuing to support the victim whilst they recover from this traumatic event\".The teenager has been remanded in custody and is expected to appear at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Saturday.Police also confirmed that the teacher sustained stab wounds, after an initial assessment described \"non-stab injuries\".\"There will continue to be a higher than usual police presence in the area over the coming days to provide further reassurance,\" Det Ch Insp Matthew Briggs said.All school events were cancelled following the incident on Thursday, with the school remaining closed on Friday but available for those requiring additional support.Following the incident, Wales First Minister Eluned Morgan said \"violence of any kind has no place in our schools\".Morgan, who visited the school last week, said her thoughts were with the injured teacher, their family and the entire school community, adding her government would support all those affected.Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said schools \"should be places of safety and learning - not fear and violence\".\"We will be standing by to offer all the support we can,\" he said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCThe search by police officers at two properties linked to Peter Mandelson features prominently in Saturday's papers. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the ex-Labour minister after suggestions he passed on market-sensitive government information to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Daily Telegraph leads with the story alongside a photo of plain-clothes officers entering a garage at his Wiltshire home. Lord Mandelson has not been arrested or commented publicly on the allegations, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Daily Mail characterises these latest developments as a \"toxic fallout\" from the release of the Epstein files, alongside a picture of police knocking on the door of Lord Mandelson's \"£12m London home. The paper says detectives with body-worn cameras began \"sifting through belongings\" of the former ambassador to the US and removed \"boxes of evidence\".\"Police rummage through Mandy's drawers\" is the Sun's take, running the same picture of police arriving at Lord Mandelson's London home.The i paper's weekend edition reports that senior government officials are preparing to hand over their communications with Lord Mandelson to Parliament's security committee, adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is \"set to dig in\" and \"brace for public backlash\".The Independent says the scandal has \"piled pressure\" on the PM to release all vetting documents related to Mandelson's appointment as ambassador to Washington.The Times says former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has told friends that she warned the PM not to appoint Lord Mandelson as ambassador due to his links with Epstein. The paper says Rayner told Sir Keir privately that appointing Mandelson would be a \"mistake\" because of the public evidence of his close relationship with the late sex offender.The Financial Times carries a warning from Sir Keir's allies in Labour that any attempt to oust him over his handling of the Mandelson scandal would \"wreak havoc on the economy\".The Guardian reports that a Labour minister was given intelligence files gathered on journalists who were investigating the Labour Together think tank that helped propel the prime minister to power. Elsewhere, rapper Snoop Dogg is seen \"breaking the ice\" at the Olympic curling rink as the Milan-Cortina Winter Games get under way.The Daily Express shifts its focus to the rise in the TV licence fee for millions, quoting MPs who have called it a \"death wish\" for the BBC. Green Party MP Sian Berry warns the increase to £180 a year will \"hurt\" already struggling households, the paper says.A woman who escaped serial killer Steve Wright says her warning to police was ignored in 1999 after she gave them a description and his car registration, the Daily Mirror reports. Emily Doherty said: \"I was ignored. For 25 years I've thought what if?\" On Friday, Wright was sentenced to 40 years for the kidnap and murder of 17-year-old Victoria Hall, and the attempted kidnap of Doherty. Wright is already serving a whole life term for the murder of five women in 2006.Finally, the Daily Star provides a dreary weather update - rain has fallen somewhere in the UK every day since the start of 2026. \"Things can only get wetter,\" is the paper's forecast.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoChristal HayesGetty ImagesRapper Lil Jon (left) with his son, Nathan Smith, in 2018The son of rapper Lil Jon is believed to have been found dead, days after he went missing from his home in the US state of Georgia, authorities said. Nathan Smith, a rapper who goes by the name DJ Young Slade, was reported missing after police said he ran out of his home early Tuesday without his phone. After days of searching, the Milton Police Department said a body, believed to be Smith, was located in a nearby pond. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office was working to provide official confirmation, police said. \"Based on the investigation to date, there is no indication of foul play,\" police said, adding they will continue to examine what led to his death. Grammy-Award winning artist Lil Jon, known for hits like Yeah! and Turn Down For What, provided a statement to BBC News saying he and Smith's mother, Nicole Smith, were \"heartbroken\". \"Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet. He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted,\" Lil Jon said in the statement. \"We loved Nathan with all of our hearts and are incredibly proud of him. He was loved and appreciated, and in our last times together we're comforted in knowing that we expressed that very sentiment to him.\" Police said they were contacted about Smith's disappearance on Tuesday morning after the 27-year-old left his home under \"unusual circumstances\". An initial missing person poster released by authorities specified that Smith left his house on foot and \"may be disoriented and in need of assistance\". Family and friends were concerned for his safety, it added. The pond where the body was discovered Friday morning was not far from Smith's residence in Milton, a city 30 miles (48 km) north of Atlanta, where his father Lil Jon made his music career.Lil Jon and Smith were frequently pictured together, including last year when the two competed on an episode of the television game show Family Feud.\"He was an amazingly talented young man; a music producer, an artist and engineer, and graduate of NYU,\" Lil Jon wrote in his statement. No more information will be released until medical examiners can determine a cause and manner of death, police said. ",

    "body": "Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia 17 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongRoyal Australian Mint$5 and 50 cent versions of the coin have been released to mark the centenary of Queen Elizabeth II's birthTwo commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch.The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday.\"That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,\" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: \"Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal.\"Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. \"There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,\" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint.\"If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,\" another said.Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams.Royal Australian MintOther people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. \"Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,\" one user wrote on social media.\"Please pick me for one of these coins,\" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it \"looks like a beautiful coin\". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop.According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation.As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs \"symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy\", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark \"her enduring support for culture\", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. \"The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,\" the mint added.Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile.

    "body": "4 hours agoTabby WilsonBBC NewsEPAUS President Donald Trump has said he could impose additional tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Iran, in an executive order signed on Friday. The order does not specify the rate that could be imposed, but uses 25% as an example, and says it will apply to goods imported into the US from any nation that \"directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran\".Trump has not directly commented on the order, but reiterated \"no nuclear weapons\" for Iran when speaking from Air Force One on Friday night.It comes amid ongoing talks between senior US and Iranian officials in Oman, following several weeks of threats from both sides. Trump threatened a 25% tariff of countries doing business with Iran earlier this year, in a post to Truth Social. On 12 January, he wrote: \"Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"At the time, no further detail was provided on how the tariffs would work in practice.The White House said that this latest executive order reaffirmed the \"ongoing national emergency with respect to Iran\", and noted that the president may modify it of circumstances change. It read: \"The President is holding Iran accountable for its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for terrorism, ballistic missile development, and regional destabilization that endanger American security, allies, and interests.\" There has been no immediate comment from Iran.Starting in Oman on Friday, the ongoing talks are the first involving US and Iranian officials since last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities.The Iranian delegation was led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, Trump said Friday's talks were \"very good\", and that Iran \"looks like it wants to make a deal very badly\". \"If they don't make a deal, the consequences are very steep,\" the president said, adding that there will be another meeting early next week. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the discussions, said they had been \"useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress\".The president has said he would be prepared to strike the Middle Eastern nation if it refused to reach a deal on its nuclear programme. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.The US has also built up a significant military presence in the region, including what Trump describes as a \"massive armada\" in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month. Human rights groups have said that many thousands of people were killed in the crackdown, but the full scale of the bloodshed remains unclear due to internet restrictions imposed by the government since 8 January.",

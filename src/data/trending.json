    "body": "Why have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham finished fourth in the Champions League but are 14th in the Premier LeagueBySam DruryBBC Sport journalist and Gary RoseBBC Sport journalistThe Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.That could become six in the last 16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.Arsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.History could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank. \"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"So why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesFinancial power and physicality?The most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.Six Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.Last summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"Did Premier League teams have easier fixtures?It is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.But was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?At the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed, external every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.Arsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.Manchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, OptaSlide 1 of 2, Easiest Champions League fixures, On target to be record breakers, but could fatigue hit?The last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.With five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.Having numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.No other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.But the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"How are other countries doing?Media caption, Benfica keeper scores stoppage time goal to seal win over Real MadridThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).That has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.Real Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica. Real were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.Other big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.The Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.Those results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.Champions League highlightsMedia caption, Spurs see off Frankfurt to secure automatic last-16 spotMedia caption, Joao Pedro scores superb double to give Chelsea top-eight finishMedia caption, Man City avoid play-offs with win against GalatasarayMedia caption, Salah scores Liverpool's third in victory over QarabagMedia caption, Newcastle come from behind to draw with holders PSGMedia caption, Arsenal maintain perfect record with narrow win over KairatWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "body": "6 hours agoYasmin RufoLeicester SquareGetty ImagesChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo have been close friends for many yearsChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo are no strangers to sharing the screen, having previously starred together in Marvel films such as Thor and Hulk.Now the pair have reunited for a very different type of film.They are starring alongside each other in Crime 101, a tense thriller that swaps superhero spectacle for a game of psychological cat and mouse.Speaking at the premiere, Hemsworth told the BBC that their long-standing friendship brought both energy and challenges to the set.\"The two of us get together and we're like a couple of naughty kids at school that need to be wrangled to be focused,\" he said. In the film, Hemsworth plays an elusive jewel thief planning one final heist, while Ruffalo stars as a determined detective intent on catching him.While the pair are well known for their comedic chemistry, Crime 101 marks a shift into darker territory.\"We have a familiarity in the comedic space,\" Hemsworth said. \"This is a dramatic film so it was quite an adjustment and discomfort at first.\"Getty ImagesMonica Barbaro (second left), Halle Berry (third left), and Barry Keoghan (second right) also star in Crime 101 Ruffalo said Crime 101 gave Hemsworth the opportunity to take on a very different type of role from those that audiences may be used to seeing.\"I got to see him do something I've been dying to see him do that I know he can do but hadn't had the director to help him,\" the 58-year-old actor said. \"When I saw him walk on set, I didn't recognise him, he was totally transformed and I thought this is what I want to see you do.\" The Poor Things actor revealed that the pair had been discussing working together outside the Marvel universe for years.\"We've been talking about doing a project for years,\" he said. \"I love him and we have a really close relationship. We always see each other and ask, 'What are we going to do together?'\"Ruffalo said it was Hemsworth who first approached him about the film.\"Chris reached out to me immediately. I read the script and thought, absolutely,\" he said.Getty ImagesBerry plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heistStarring alongside Hemsworth and Ruffalo is Halle Berry, who plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heist. The 59-year-old said her character showed that \"women of a certain age are not indispensable and resists that by standing up for herself\". That mentality is very similar to how Berry sees herself, telling the BBC she is focused on \"building a company to help women going through perimenopause\", which she was diagnosed with in her early 50s.The American actor says she is \"always\" being pigeonholed into a certain role due to her age but she \"resists at every turn\". Berry is set to play President Joanna Duncan, a gender-swapped version of the lead role from the The President is Missing, a political thriller novel by Bill Clinton. \"It's my fantasy to have a female American president and I would love to see a woman lead the country and I hope to get to see that in my lifetime but at least I get to play one.\" 'Grit and authenticity'Crime 101 features all the classic car chases and stunts you'd imagine from an old school crime thriller and Hemsworth said that was one of the most enjoyable parts of filming. \"The stunts were intense for all the right reasons - you have the adrenaline pumping and you're like a big kid, and that's what I love about doing those films.\" The Australian actor joked that his upbringing \"on farms where we were bashing about in old cars\" helped prepare him for the car chasing stunts. Avoiding stunt doubles and green screen added to the film's authenticity, according to Hemsworth. \"It is really us experiencing those emotions so there's an added layer of grit and authenticity,\" he said. Outside of acting, Hemsworth has been throwing himself into new challenges, from fitness experiments to learning new skills.His Limitless documentary sees him explore ways to live longer and healthier and as part of the show which aired last summer he learnt to play drums, eventually performing live with Ed Sheeran. National GeographicHemsworth joined Ed Sheeran on stage in Romania last year after learning to play the drums\"I had planned to continue the drumming,\" he said, \"but that period was so intense I get PTSD when I see a drum set.\"With three children, he said he knew he should return to it \"for my brain health\", but suggested his brief moment on stage might remain a one-off.\"Ed Sheeran is doing a tour in Australia and he said he'd come get me and three beers into that conversation I agreed. \"I thought about it again when I was sober and told him I'm not doing that again. I've done it once and checked that box.\" ",

    "body": "3 hours agoMany of the papers have headlined on Iran, with the Mail declaring: \"Countdown to conflagration\". It says US President Donald Trump has issued a \"chilling threat\" to the Middle Eastern nation, demanding that the Ayatollah make a nuclear deal or \"face an overwhelming military onslaught\". Tehran says that any attack on Iran would be considered an \"act of war\", the Mail reports.The Guardian writes that a US armada \"heads towards Iran\", and notes that it is \"prepared to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence if necessary\" as per Trump's post to Truth Social. The \"decline of Britain's high streets\" also features prominently on the front page, with new research from the University of Southhampton indicating that the Labour Party must address the problem or risk being \"washed away in a tide of discontent\". \"Trump's war threat to Iran\" says the Mirror, alongside a photo of the USS Abraham Lincoln, which reportedly leads the armada currently en route to the Gulf.The unfolding situation in Iran has been labelled a \"nuclear ultimatum\" by the i Paper, which reports that people are fleeing Tehran in anticipation of an imminent attack. Iran's foreign minister has said that armed forces are ready \"with fingers on the trigger\" to \"powerfully respond\" to aggression.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is the focus of the Daily Telegraph's leading story, which says he called for European human rights laws to be invoked in order to investigate British soldiers in Iraq, in a book published by \"disgraced lawyer\" Phil Shiner. The piece follows on from the paper's front page yesterday, which revealed Sir Keir's involvement in a landmark legal case in 2007. A No 10 spokesperson said that the prime minister assisted the court on points of law, but did not advocate for either side. \"The prime minister was not involved in the subsequent case heard in the European Court of Human Rights,\" the spokesperson said, and added that allegations were a \"desperate and deliberate misrepresentation\".\"PM shelves fresh plan to overhaul benefits\" reads the Times, which says that Sir Keir has vetoed plans for a new attempt to reform the UK's welfare system. Two reviews of the welfare state are due to report this year, it reports, but both are expected to require legislation. This latest decision by the prime minister makes welfare reform before the next election unlikely, according to the paper.The Express quotes Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch on its front page, following a speech where she addressed recent defections to Reform UK. \"My party is for serious people and not drama queens,\" said Badenoch, and claimed those joining Nigel Farage were having a \"tantrum dressed up as politics\".The world's biggest mining companies have added almost half a trillion dollars to their valuations this year, according to the Financial Times. The paper notes that the \"biggest winners\" included Rio Tinto and Glencore, as well as Sydney-listed BHP and China's Zijin Mining.A retired police official has told the Sun that he believes nurse Lucy Letby is innocent, and that her conviction could be \"the greatest miscarriage of justice this century\". Letby is currently serving 15 life sentences in jail for the murder of seven babies, and the attempted murder of seven more.The Metro reports that a British lotto winner has been jailed for building a \"drug empire\" worth £228m. The paper says the man, 80, won £2.4m in 2010.\"Spend it like Beckham\" says the Star, pricing a wine featured in Brooklyn Beckham's Instagram post at £80,000.Donald Trump's threat to Iran is covered by almost all of the front pages. \"Countdown to conflagration\" is the Daily Mail's headline. The Guardian says the threat of a US-Iranian war \"appeared to loom closer\" following the president's warning. According to the Daily Mirror, he is said to be \"considering targets including weapons caches and members of the Revolutionary Guard\". The i Paper says it has learned that \"Iranians are fleeing\" the capital. The front of the Financial Times has a picture of an \"anti-American\" poster in Tehran. It appears to show explosions on the deck of an aircraft carrier, with the slogan \"if you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind\".Many papers cover Sir Keir Starmer's trip to China. The Sun focuses on a deal designed to cut the flow from China of boat parts and engines used by migrants for channel crossings - with Sir Keir saying it will \"cut off the supply at source\". The Express is scathing in its analysis of the prime minister's meeting with President Xi Jinping. It describes Sir Keir coming face to face with \"one of the world's most powerful leaders\" as the \"greatest mismatch of our time\". But the Mirror's editorial says the prime minister is \"right to engage\" with China, in \"grown-up diplomacy\" which involves \"doing business without selling our soul\".The Times says Sir Keir has \"vetoed\" plans for a new attempt to change the benefits system, as Number 10 seeks \"to avoid another confrontation with Labour MPs\". The paper says the Department for Work and Pensions has been unsuccessful in including its bills in the King's Speech, which sets out the government's legislative agenda. But officials say \"final decisions\" on its contents \"have not been made\".The investment minister, Lord Stockwood, has told the Financial Times that there are discussions within government about introducing a universal basic income for workers in sectors that are likely to be wiped out by artificial intelligence. He tells the paper there's a need to \"think really carefully\" about how to \"soft-land those industries that go away\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "6 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSantander is closing a further 44 branches, putting 291 jobs at risk.It is the latest swathe of closures by the Spanish-owned bank which, like others on the high street, is closing bricks-and-mortar stores as customers move online.Last year, it announced plans to close 95, or a quarter, of its branches which had 750 workers. Lloyds Bank is also planning to shut more than 100 branches by March under a scheme of closures announced last year.Ministers have criticised the closure of bank branches, arguing it restricts access to cash for elderly and vulnerable people.Announcing the latest closures, Santander said 96% of its transactions are now done digitally.It added that wherever a store is closing, a Santander representative will operate from a nearby banking hub or Santander Local - locations in libraries and community centres where customers can seek help one day each week.\"We will continue to invest in both our branch network - comprising of full-service branches, counter-free branches, reduced-hour branches, Santander Locals, and our increasingly popular work cafes - as well as our digital banking services, so we can be there to support our customers however they choose to bank with us,\" Santander said.With several banks choosing to close branches across the UK, concerns have been raised about \"banking deserts\", with parts of Yorkshire leaving people without a bank for 10 miles.A solution, in the form of so-called \"banking hubs\", has also been slow to roll out. Funded by the major high street banks and created by not-for-profit organisation Cash Access UK, they are run by local Post Office managers and customers from multiple banks can use them.The full list of Sandander branches along with their proposed closing date is:Andover, Hampshire - 12 May 2026Banbridge, County Down - 19 May 2026Bangor, County Down - 29 April 2026Berwick Upon Tweed, Northumberland - 28 April 2026Bishop Auckland, County Durham - 05 May 2026Boston, Lincolnshire - 28 April 2026Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan - 12 May 2026Bridgwater, Somerset - 29 April 2026Cwmbran, Gwent - 13 May 2026Enniskillen, County Fermanagh - 12 May 2026Evesham, Worcestershire - 28 April 2026Glengormley, County Antrim - 06 May 2026Golders Green, London - 13 May 2026Gosport, Hampshire - 05 May 2026Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire - 05 May 2026Heswall, Merseyside - 13 May 2026Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire - 05 May 2026Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire - 29 April 2026Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire - By the end of January 2027Leyland, Lancashire - 06 May 2026Liskeard, Cornwall - 20 May 2026Macclesfield, Cheshire - 12 May 2026Mansfield, Nottinghamshire - 06 May 2026Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire - 29 April 2026Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan - 06 May 2026Mold, Clwyd - 28 April 2026Newbury, Berkshire - 29 April 2026Newton Abbot, Devon - 19 May 2026Northallerton, North Yorkshire - 06 May 2026Ormskirk, Lancashire - By the end of January 2027Pontefract, West Yorkshire - 05 May 2026Ramsgate, Kent - 28 April 2026Redditch, Worcestershire - 13 May 2026Ringwood, Hampshire - 06 May 2026Scunthorpe, South Humberside - 29 April 2026Shirley, West Midlands - 20 May 2026Stafford, Staffordshire - 19 May 2026Stranraer, Wigtownshire - 13 May 2026Stratford Upon Avon, Warwickshire - 12 May 2026Tonbridge, Kent - 29 April 2026Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire - 05 May 2026Whitehaven, Cumbria - By the end of January 2027Wilmslow, Cheshire - By the end of January 2027Woking, Surrey - 28 April 2026",

    "body": "8 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentSimon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBritish car, van, truck and bus production fell to its lowest level since 1952 last year, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Its chief executive Mike Hawes said it had been \"the toughest year in a generation\", with output hit by a major cyberattack at Jaguar Land Rover, the closure of Vauxhall's plant in Luton and deep uncertainty over US trade policy.The situation is expected to improve this year, with the introduction of new electric models. The SMMT believes production of cars and vans could exceed 1 million by 2027.But Hawes warned that \"increasingly protectionist\" proposals emerging from  Brussels represented a \"significant threat\" to the UK industry.Overall, 764,715 vehicles were built in 2025, which was 15.5% fewer than in 2024. The vast majority of these were cars, with 717,371 leaving the production line. That was some 60,000 fewer than last year.Last year, vehicle manufacturing was badly affected by a number of one-off or temporary issues. They included the cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover, which forced the company to shut down its computer networks and brought its factories to a halt at the beginning of September.Facilities which would normally build thousands of cars each week remained idle for more than a month, and production did not get back to normal for some time after that.With roughly 78% of the cars built in the UK destined for export, the industry is also vulnerable to trade disruption. US President Donald Trump's sudden announcement in April of import taxes, or tariffs, on cars sent to America prompted some manufacturers to limit shipments there.Ultimately, a deal was done which removed the threat of very high levies. But the basic tariff on UK cars exported to the US still increased from 2.5% to 10%, and had a dampening effect on sales.A further factor that limited car production last year was the earlier decision by Nissan and JLR to end production of ageing models while preparing their factories to produce a new generation of electric vehicles.The latest version of Nissan's electric Leaf began rolling out of its factory in Sunderland in mid-December, while JLR's new electric Range Rover and the first of a new generation of electric Jaguars are due to emerge from its Solihull plant later this year.Output of commercial vehicles, meanwhile, fell 62% last year to just 47,344. The bulk of the decline was caused by the closure of Vauxhall's plant in Luton, which shut its doors for good in late March. Parent company Stellantis is consolidating its UK van production at its Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire.The SMMT believes this year will be better, with car output expected to rise by 10% as production of new models ramps up. According to Hawes, there is a \"pathway\" to increasing output of cars and vans to more than 1 million per year by 2027.This \"optimisitic but realistic\" target would rely on the introduction of more new models, he said, as well as a recovery in demand in key export markets, especially in Europe. It would also require the government to implement key parts of its Modern Industrial Strategy, notably measures to drive down what the SMMT describes as the UK's stubbornly high cost of energy.The government's own target is more ambitious. It wants the UK to produce 1.3 million vehicles a year by 2035. For that to happen, according to Hawes, a new manufacturer would need to set up a factory in the UK – with a Chinese firm the most likely target. \"In terms of who is expanding their production globally, obviously it's the Chinese,\" he said.However, the UK industry is also facing threats which could significantly harm future production.Hawes expressed deep concern about what he called a shift towards a 'Made in Europe' approach from the EU authorities. This included plans to restrict government subsidies for low emission vehicles to those built in Europe, as well as measures forcing corporate fleets to favour European-made cars.\"Unless the UK can be seen as part of that, these proposals could have the effect of delivering what Brexit didn't deliver – and that's making it much harder for UK produced vehicles to access the European market,\" he said. \"So this is a significant threat.\"He also pointed to tougher European Union 'rules of origin' measures which are due to come into force in January next year. These will significantly increase the amount of parts and components produced in the EU or the UK that needs to be included in electric vehicles exported in either direction, if they are to be exempted from steep tariffs imposed at the border.However, many EVs being transported across the channel still do not meet these requirements. This is largely because battery-building capacity in the UK and Europe has not grown as quickly as was expected when the rules were drawn up. Hawes said he was hoping an agreement could be reached during the year, in order to give manufacturers more time to comply.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "9 hours agoJessica RawnsleyEPA/ShutterstockSeveral cars were damaged in one coastal area after the roof of a university collapsedAt least five people have died after Storm Kristin tore through central and northern Portugal, causing flooding, landslides and widespread damage.The storm, which the government described as an \"extreme climactic event\", left schools shuttered, buildings damaged and travel severely disrupted. In the coastal city of Figueira da Foz, a Ferris wheel overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a building.Portugal has been hit by a succession of storms in recent days, including one over the weekend in which a man died after his car was swept away in floods.Heavy rain and wind gusts of up to 150km (95 miles) per hour caused more than 3,000 weather-related incidents across the country, civil protection authorities said. Several people were struck by falling trees or debris. The strongest winds were recorded at the Monte Real air base in Leiria, where gusts of 178km were recorded before the monitoring equipment was destroyed. Officials said the location was likely the storm's entry point to mainland Portugal.More than 850,000 people lost power on Wednesday, according to electricity distributor E-Redes. EPAA ferris wheel was overturned and several vehicles were hit when part of a roof was torn from a buildingThe civil protection agency (ANEPC) reported that three people had died in the central district of Leiria - one of the worst affected areas.In Leira, one person was hit by a metal sheet, and another was trapped in the structure of a house, according to officials. Local media said a man in Vila Franca de Xira died when a tree struck his car, local media said. There were also reports of a death in the Marinha Grande area.Transport across Portugal has been severely disrupted, with roads - including the main motorway connecting Lisbon to the north - and railways blocked by debris.Ten coastal areas were placed under a red weather warning on Wednesday due to dangerous sea conditions, with waves forecast to reach up to 14m (45ft,11in), according to the Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere (IPMA).The PSP (Public Security Police) urged people in Coimbra and Leira to stay inside, while Portugal's Secretary of State for Civil Protection said the country remained on maximum alert.Prime Minister Luis Montenegro expressed condolences to the victims' families. He said authorities were assessing the damage and would take \"whatever measures are necessary\".Meanwhile, Leiria's mayor, Goncalo Lopes, urged the government to declare a state of emergency.\"We have public spaces turned upside down,\" he told reporters. \"It's something that will require a very large recovery effort in the coming months. The impact is similar to what a bomb could mean in our city, with massive destruction.\"After crossing Portugal, Storm Kristin moved east into Spain - bringing with it snow, rain and strong winds. The storm caused widespread disruption across the country, with schools, roads and train lines closed and hundreds of thousands without power.In Andalusia, emergency services reported some 2,000 weather-related incidents.Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, warned of very strong winds in some areas, with gusts expected to reach hurricane force. A red weather alert has been issued for parts of Almeria in the south-east due to the strength of the wind.",

    "body": "9 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorZoe KleinmanBBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman took a look at Waymo's driverless taxis Waymo, the US driverless car firm, said it hopes to be operating a robotaxi service in London as soon as September this year.  The UK government has said it plans to change regulations in the second half of 2026 to enable driverless taxis to operate in the city but has not given a specific date.Waymo said a pilot service will launch in April and Local Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said: \"We're supporting Waymo and other operators through our passenger pilots, and pro-innovation regulations to make self-driving cars a reality on British roads.\"The firm, which is owned by Google-parent Alphabet, showed off a fleet of cars it brought to the UK at London's Transport Museum on Wednesday.Waymo's vehicles are currently being operated by a safety driver, mapping the streets.But when the service launches to paying passengers, there will be no human at the wheel.Greenwood, who attended the Waymo event, said she expected driverless vehicles to make city roads safer.\"We know that unlike human drivers, automated vehicles don't get tired, don't get distracted and don't drive under the influence,\" she said.But she added that autonomous vehicles also had to meet strict safety standards, \"including protection from hacking and cyber threats\" before they would be allowed on UK roads.The government has estimated that the autonomous vehicle industry could add £42bn to the UK economy by 2035 and create nearly 40,000 new jobs.Passengers will be able to hail Waymo robotaxis via an app once the rules permit. They will not initially include airport drop-offs.The Waymo vehicle uses four sensor systems to gather data from the world around it: lidar, vision, radar and microphone.It claims these sensors enable its vehicles to be aware of its surroundings 360 degrees, as far as three football fields ahead and during bad weather.A powerful computer in the boot processes that data and determines the cars actions and reactions in real time.A Waymo spokesperson said pricing would be \"competitive\" but \"premium\" and would rise during periods of high demand.Zoe KleinmanWaymo has partnered with Jaguar for its robotaxisRival companies Uber and Lyft are also ready to launch robotaxi services in the UK when the rules change.Waymo's cars are Jaguars while Lyft and Uber have both chosen to partner with the Chinese firm Baidu.Waymo says a total of 173 million miles have been driven by its cars fully autonomously, mainly in the US. Waymo has a fleet of 1,000 robotaxis in San Francisco and 700 in LA.Although there have been some stories about cars malfunctioning and leaving passengers trapped inside.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKoh EweandJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent in BangkokCCTVDozens of members of the Ming mafia were sentenced in 2025China has executed 11 members of a notorious mafia family that ran scam centres in Myanmar along its north-eastern border, state media report.The Ming family members were sentenced in September for various crimes including homicide, illegal detention, fraud and operating gambling dens by a court in China's Zhejiang province.The Mings were one of many clans that ran the town of Laukkaing, transforming an impoverished backwater town into a flashy hub of casinos and red-light districts.Their scam empire came crashing down in 2023, when they were detained and handed over to China by ethnic militias that had taken control of Laukkaing during an escalation in their conflict with Myanmar's army.With these executions Beijing is sending a message of deterrence to would-be scammers. But the business has now moved to Myanmar's border with Thailand, and to Cambodia and Laos, where China has much less influence.Hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to run online scams in Myanmar and elsewhere in South East Asia, according to estimates by the UN. Among them are thousands of Chinese people, and their victims who they swindle billions of dollars from are mainly Chinese too.  Frustrated by the Myanmar military's refusal to stop the scam business, from which it was almost certainly profiting, Beijing tacitly backed an offensive by an ethnic insurgent alliance in Shan State in late 2023. The alliance captured significant territory from the military and overran Laukkaing, a key border town.Who are the Ming family?The eleven members of the Ming family are the first of the Myanmar scam bosses to be executed by China. But they will not be the last. Five members of the Bai family were also sentenced to death in November, and the trials of two other groups of defendants from the Wei and the Liu families have not yet concluded.The Ming family's trial was held behind closed doors, although more than 160 people were allowed to attend their sentencing hearing last year, including families of victims.The Ming mafia's scam operations and gambling dens brought in more than 10bn yuan ($1.4bn; £1bn) between 2015 and 2023, according to China's highest court, which rejected their appeals in November. Their crimes resulted in the deaths of 14 Chinese citizens and injuries to many others, the court said.More than 20 others from the Ming family were given jail sentences in September ranging from five years to life. Ming Xuechang, the clan's patriarch, killed himself in 2023 while trying to avoid detention, Myanmar's military had said back then.The Mings were among a handful of Godfather-esque families who rose to power in Laukkaing in the early 2000s. This was after the town's then warlord was ousted in a military operation led by Min Aung Hlaing, who became the leader of Myanmar's military government after the 2021 coup. The head of the family, Ming Xuechang, ran one of the most infamous of Laukkaing's scam centres, Crouching Tiger Villa.At first gambling and prostitution were the main sources of income for these families, but they eventually started online fraud, staffed mostly by people who were kidnapped and forced to run these scams.  Within the walls of the sprawling, well-guarded compounds was a culture of violence. Beatings and torture were routine, according to testimonies collected from freed workers. ",

    "body": "8 hours agoEmily HoltOlivia PetterJournalist and author Olivia Petter examines modern dating dilemmas in her book Millennial LoveBreak-ups are tough - you suddenly lose the person you shared everything with. But staying friends with an ex can be equally as painful.\"I don't have many friends who are friends with their exes, actually,\" says Olivia Petter, author of dating handbook Millennial Love. But she has managed it in a couple of cases.Here are the four questions you should ask before deciding whether to stay friends or go no contact.1. How serious was it?\"There are one or two men I've had brief, casual romantic relationships with that have evolved into friendships,\" Olivia told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.\"The fact that we've 'gone there', so to speak, makes it easier for us to have close friendships without any lingering tensions or question marks,\" she says.But when it comes to serious relationships, she says while she's on good terms with them they're not close friends.Dating and relationship coach Kate Mansfield says casual relationships often have less serious life stuff to untangle, so the transition into friendship can be smoother.But occasionally, casual relationships can trigger bigger emotions because they are \"often much more intense,\" she says.\"It depends really on the way it ended, and who ended it, was it a mutual fizzle, or did one person decide it was over? This has more of an impact than time invested in itself,\" says Kate.2. Are you over them?One of the biggest obstacles is whether you are able to separate the romance from the person. \"You need to have processed the break-up, not just moved on logistically, but emotionally,\" Kate says.Consider whether you have enough in common outside of a relationship, such as genuine interests that existed independently of romance, she says. If the  relationship was built entirely on attraction, it will be much harder to continue it. It's also important to be honest about why you want to remain friends. \"If you're still hoping they'll change their mind, or if you're staying connected to monitor their dating life, that's attachment masquerading as friendship,\" says Kate.In the end, staying friends only works if both people have truly accepted the end of the relationship, and neither has an ulterior motive, she adds.3. How much time has passed?Rosie WilbyRosie is also the author of the book 'The Breakup Monologues' about relationships. It can be tricky to transition immediately from lovers to friends.\"It's important to have a little reset and to take some space away to reflect,\" Olivia says. Comedian and author Rosie Wilby says she's been able to maintain successful friendships with her ex-girlfriends.She and her ex Donna broke up just after Rosie's mother had died and they lost all their possessions in a house fire.She says they only ever went no contact for about three weeks.\"That was probably about all we managed, because we had this close bond and we needed each other,\" she says.Now 25 years later: \"Donna feels like a sister to me,\" she says. 4. Is your new partner ok with it?If you do decide to stay friends, then Kate says you need to talk openly about what you are both going to do if the other gets into a new relationship.And if a new partner is uncomfortable with the friendship, Kate stresses you should take their concerns seriously. \"It's not always insecurity; sometimes it's a legitimate concern,\" she says.You may need to have a conversation with your ex to adjust the friendship which could be \"less frequent contact, more group settings, or being more transparent about what you're doing together,\" she says.Olivia says women are conditioned to see male partners' exes as threats.But Rosie says in LGBT communities, it's more common to stay friends with an ex.\"There's a completely different code of conduct,\" she says.When to go no contactKate says there are cases when a friendship isn't possible; if the situation is abusive, emotionally or physically, there has been broken trust or one person is still romantically involved. \"Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for both of you is to accept that this chapter is closed,\" she says.Olivia says: \"The only people I've cut off complete contact with are those who've caused me more serious harm in one way or another.\" She says most of her friends are not in touch with exes.\"I think there's an attitude of leaving the past in the past.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "Keep suspended pupils in school, ministers say6 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesThe government hopes the move will limit the amount of learning suspended pupils miss Pupils should not automatically be sent home if they are suspended from school in England and could instead remain on site, the government has said.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said being sent home could mean children \"retreating to social media\".She said on-site suspensions should be used for pupils who had not been violent.The Department for Education (DfE) said the move, which will form part of broader changes to the school system in England, should limit the amount of learning pupils miss.Pupils can be removed from classrooms without being suspended, and many schools already use internal suspensions - although what that looks like can vary.The DfE said pupils could sometimes be set \"generic work that does not support learning or reintegration\" when they were internally suspended, and it would make clear that \"internal suspension is a short, structured intervention with meaningful learning and time for reflection\".The number and rate of suspensions had been increasing before Covid, but the rise has accelerated ever since.The number of suspensions increased by 21% between 2022-23 and 2023-24 - from 787,000 to 955,000. Over the same period, the rate of suspensions rose from 9.33 per 100 pupils in 2022-23 to 11.31 in 2023-24. The largest percentage rise was in primary schools.Head teachers will decide which form suspensions should take.Richard Walkden, head teacher at Ecclesfield Secondary School in Sheffield, said sending children home was seen as a last resort, but suspensions demonstrated to pupils that there were \"lines in the sand\" when it came to behaviour.\"Suspensions are never easy. They cause harm,\" he said.\"Lost learning is the biggest one. Students get one chance at education in secondary. They've got five years and every day matters.\"But he added: \"I fundamentally understand running the schools I have done for many years, that suspensions sometimes are needed and required.\"BBC/ Hazel ShearingHead teacher Richard Walkden says suspensions cause harm, including lost learning Phillipson said: \"Suspensions will always play a critical role in helping heads manage poor behaviour, but time at home today can too easily mean children retreating to social media, gaming and the online world.\"She said it resulted in \"high levels of lost learning\", adding: \"We want to restore suspensions as the serious sanction they should be, while keeping young people engaged in their education and reducing the time teachers spend helping pupils catch up.\"Pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) and those who are eligible for free school meals have much higher rates of suspensions and permanent exclusions than average.Schools can give up to three reasons for suspending a pupil. In 2023-24, \"persistent disruptive behaviour\" made up more than half (51%) of all reasons given for suspensions.\"Physical assault against a pupil\" made up 13% and \"physical assault against an adult\" accounted for 6%.The DfE said \"the most serious and violent behaviour\" would still result in pupils being removed from school. Permanent exclusions will continue to exist.It said it would consult on a new \"framework\" that would \"give heads the flexibility to ensure pupils facing suspension for non-violent behaviour continue learning in a separate, supervised setting, away from other pupils\".The measure will feature in the government's delayed Schools White Paper, which will also set out plans to reform the Send system.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the BBC he welcomed greater consistency but had some concerns.\"The fear for head teachers will be how will they be held to account for the data that they share [and] how can they make sure that they've got the resources and investment to do the best possible job for internal seclusions and internal exclusions - because all of that requires a lot of investment,\" he said. Matt Wrack, general secretary of NASUWT teachers' union, said there was an opportunity to \"offer helpful clarity\" for schools, but questioned \"how these expectations will be fulfilled in every school in the absence of any additional funding or resources to support these measures\".Marianne Lagrue, a policy manager at Coram Children's Legal Centre, said existing approaches to internal suspensions and removing pupils from classrooms varied. She said \"worst case scenarios\" existed where children were being kept in isolation away from friends and the classroom for months \"without being suspended or excluded formally\".Isolation could be particularly difficult for pupils with certain types of Send, she added.\"We hope that with the Schools White Paper... the Department for Education will take the opportunity to make sure that those children get better support rather than just being isolated in a room with no stimulation.\"",

It will now use the manufacturing plant in California that made those cars to produce its line of humanoid robots - known as Optimus.In January, China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's biggest EV maker, while Musk's involvement in politics both in the US and abroad has proved controversial.Tesla also revealed a $2bn (£1.45bn) investment in Musk's artificial intelligence venture, xAI.\"A lot of investors asked us to do this,\" Musk said of Tesla's participation in xAI's latest funding round. \"They say we should invest in xAI, so we're just doing what shareholders asked us to do pretty much.\"The move comes despite a recent vote taken by Tesla shareholders on a proposal to invest in xAI. Abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.Last year, investors overwhelmingly voted to grant Musk - the world's richest person - a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn.To collect that payout he must drastically raise the firm's market value over the next 10 years.The company is also due to significantly ramp up spending, by an estimated $20bn.\"It's going to be a very big [capital expenditure] next year,\" Musk said on a call with analysts. \"We're making big investments for an epic future.\"Tesla shares rose by about 2% in extended trading.It comes after Musk's entry into politics, including a high-profile cost-cutting role in the administration of US President Donald Trump.His political activities alienated parts of Tesla's customer base, with some protesting at its dealerships around the world.The shift away from its EV roots also coincides with Trump rescinding some US government subsidies for non-fossil fuel cars.Tesla, which was once one of the world's most profitable car companies, has also been pushing deeper into robotaxis.The company's shift into newer businesses also comes as it contends with a dated line of electric vehicle, analysts say.\"The Model S and Model X have been low-volume vehicles for Tesla for a while now,\" said Jessica Caldwell, Head of Insights at Edmunds.\"From a portfolio and focus standpoints, it makes sense to drop them and concentrate on higher-volume products like the Model 3 and Model Y, along with other business expansion bets,\" Caldwell added.",

    "body": "8 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesWater bills will rise by £2.70 a month on average from April, a year on from hefty increases for households in many parts of the country.The average annual bill in England and Wales will increase by £33 to £639, prompting calls for a \"stronger safety net\" for those unable to pay.The size of the increase and the cost of the average bill both vary widely across different regions, with one water-only supplier raising prices by 13%.The industry trade body, Water UK, said bill increases were needed to fund vital upgrades to the system and tackle spillages that have caused a public outcry. The figures come a few days after it was announced water bills in Scotland would rise by an average of £42 a year (up 8.7%), taking the average bill to £532 a year.Firms have been granted permission by the regulator to increase bills to pay for upgrades after decades of underinvestment, as public anger has simmered about sewage released into the UK's rivers and seas. Household water bills climbed by £10 a month to an average of more than £600 last April, and this year will see another above-inflation increase.The average bill in England and Wales will go up by 5.4%, compared to the latest Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation of 3.4%.However, different suppliers charge different amounts, and the increases vary sharply too.Getty ImagesSouth East Water required bottle stations during disruptions to suppliesThames Water, which raised prices significantly nearly a year ago, will only increase bills by an average of £3 a year, or 0.4%, this April, taking its average bill to  £658 a year.At the other end of the scale among water and sewerage companies, customers of Severn Trent Water will see a rise of 10% (up £52 to £587). Hafren Dyfrdwy is raising annual bills by 9% (up £54 to £635), and United Utilities is also increasing bills by 9% (up £57 to £660).Among water-only companies, customers of Affinity Water's central region will see a 13% increase. Bristol Water is raising average bills by 12%, but bills in Affinity Water's East region will only go up by 0.4%.Some 30,000 properties had no water at the height of the problems which the company blamed, in part, on Storm Goretti and a power cut at a pumping plant.'Urgent' investmentIndustry trade body Water UK said companies were preparing to invest £20bn over the year to secure water supplies, support economic growth and end sewage entering rivers and seas.\"While we urgently need investment in our water and sewage infrastructure, we know that for many this increase will be difficult,\" said chief executive David Henderson.He said 2.5 million households would be supported through discounted social tariffs and other affordability measures.But the Consumer Council for Water, which represents customers, said a patchwork of different social tariff schemes meant where someone lived - rather than their actual level of need - could determine what support they received.\"A stronger safety net is also needed for those who simply can't afford these bill rises,\" said its chief executive, Mike Keil.The group said people could cut bills by:Checking if they are eligible to discounted tariffsTrialling a water meterSaving water, for example, by setting a time limit on showersThe water regulator Ofwat said it would monitor companies' performance and hold them to account.\"If they do not deliver on their commitments, they will be made to return money to customers in their future bills,\" it said.Graphics by Tommy LumbyGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "11 hours agoHarry Farley,Political correspondentandHenry Zeffman,Chief Political CorrespondentFuture Publishing via Getty ImagesDemonstrators on both sides campaigned in the weeks leading up to the historic Commons vote back in JuneIt is now \"very, very difficult\" to see how the assisted dying bill could become law this year, a leading backer of the change has told BBC News.Lord Falconer said the legislation has \"absolutely no hope\" of passing without a \"fundamental change\" in the House of Lords' approach.The former justice secretary is threatening an unprecedented use of the Parliament Act to override peers' objections if it is not passed before the King's Speech in May.The rarely used powers would set up a constitutional clash over what is a highly sensitive issue.HoC via PA MediaThe Terminally Ill Adults Bill passed in the House of Commons with a backing of 314 votes to 291 last summerOpponents believe the assisted dying legislation is unsafe, particularly for vulnerable people, and needs extensive amending before it could become law.A government source said many ministers now believed the bill would not pass through the Lords and hoped a compromise could be brokered.\"It seems pretty clear to us now that the House of Lords is not going to pass this bill,\" the government source said.They suggested a Royal Commission could be formed to examine some of the practical questions raised by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's proposal.The source said using the Parliament Act for a private member's bill would be deeply controversial.\"The prime minister will need to step in before it gets to that stage,\" the government source said.A source close to Labour MPs and peers opposed to the Bill said the threat of using the Parliament Act \"is the act of a bully who knows they are losing the argument\".They said that because the proposed legislation would have to be identical it would mean forcing a flawed bill into law with no ability to change it.Lord Falconer insisted the Parliament Act was an \"established part of our constitution\" and peers should not block the bill given elected MPs had approved it.Typically bills brought by backbench MPs, called Private Members' Bills, fall unless they are passed by both the Commons and the Lords in one parliamentary session. A session ends when Parliament is prorogued, and a new one begins with a King's Speech – which is expected in May.The Parliament Act allows for a bill that has been passed by the Commons but rejected by the Lords to return in a new parliamentary session. If an identical bill passes the Commons a second time, the Lords cannot block it again and the legislation will become law at the end of that second session even without the Lords' approval.The powers have only been used seven times since 1911.There are also several hurdles supporters would need to overcome. Someone willing to bring the exact same bill would need to be drawn high up in the ballot of MPs able to bring a Private Members Bill. Asked if it was now impossible for the bill to pass, Lord Falconer told BBC News: \"It's very very difficult, it's not impossible if the Lords were to change the way that they were dealing with it.\"\"I've seen no sign so far that there's going to be a change,\" he added. \"But if it goes on like this it has absolutely no hope whatsoever of getting out of the Lords.\"Pressed on the controversy of using the Parliament Act to prevent the Lords from blocking the bill a second time, Lord Falconer said: \"The issue about assisted dying is very controversial, but ultimately somebody in our constitution has got to decide whether the country should make the change.\"The people who should decide it should be the elected representatives in the Commons. If they make up their mind but are blocked in giving effect to that decision by a small number of peers then the constitutional answer is the Parliament Act.\"Lord Falconer has written to all peers on Wednesday evening setting out a number of amendments he will table, aimed at addressing concerns such as around those with eating disorders becoming eligible for an assisted death, and toughening restrictions on advertising for the service.\"It is our responsibility as a House to find a way forward,\" he told peers, urging them to back the changes.However several peers believe the change is dangerous and could mean vulnerable people are pressured into ending their lives prematurely.A source close to Labour MPs and Peers opposed to the Bill told BBC News: \"Threats to use the 'nuclear option' of the Parliament Act to recklessly force through this bill, which poses such risks to the vulnerable, is the act of a bully who knows they are losing the argument on the substance... \"People need to be very clear, using the Parliament act to force this through would mean that none of the known issues with the Bill would be fixed.\"Every MP who voted to force it though would bear responsibility for the inevitable suffering and deaths of vulnerable people.\"",

    "body": "The death of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second fatal shooting by federal agents there in less than a month, reignited a public outcry at the tactics used in the city's sweeping immigration operation.A growing backlash after the 37-year-old nurse was shot and killed on Saturday prompted a shift in tone from President Donald Trump - who said his administration was going to \"de-escalate a little bit\".But tensions have been high in Minneapolis for weeks, with frequent protests and confrontations between residents and federal agents. New footage published by the News Movement and shared with BBC News shows an altercation between Pretti and federal officers 11 days before his death.A spokesperson for the family has confirmed the man in the video is Pretti. In a separate statement released to media, the family's lawyer said \"nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing\".BBC analysis editor Ros Atkins examines this new footage - and explains how Trump changed course on Minneapolis.Produced by Katerina Karelli.

    "body": "'Why can't women have experience?' New Bridgerton series tackles sex taboo30 minutes agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterNetflixFrancesca married John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin, in season threeSpoiler warning: This article contains details of the fourth series of BridgertonOne final tightening of the corset, a sharp intake of breath and we're good to go. Yes, another savage debutante season is upon us as matchmaking mayhem descends on Bridgerton once more.While part of the Netflix Regency drama's undoubted appeal has always been its steamy sex scenes between members of \"the ton\" - or high society - series four addresses a taboo that may undermine those apparently sultry encounters.And as newlyweds Francesca nee Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) and John Stirling (Victor Alli) return to Mayfair from the Highlands, that knowledge gap is causing tension in the bedroom.The pair, whose official titles are the Earl of Kilmartin and Lady Kilmartin, are struggling to connect between the sheets, and Francesca is desperate to find out if she's missing something. And who best to ask about the mystery of female sexual pleasure than your girl tribe, including her mother, Lady Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) and sister-in-law Penelope (Nicola Coughlin)?\"It was really nice to see Francesca leaning on her female counterparts to go and get that information but it's this unfair thing where men are allowed to have experience and women are not allowed to have experience,\" Dodd tells BBC News.\"Unless you can have those conversations, I don't understand how women were meant to get this information, physically and anatomically. Francesca doesn't know what's meant to be happening!\"In the series the couple also discuss the issue between themselves.\"John and Francesca have literally met the year before so there's a lot of getting to know each other but there's gaps where they're both introverts... they really have to  push themselves outside their comfort zones to even have those conversations.\"It was really nice to actually show the honesty of that in relationships,\" she adds.Neurodivergent representationBridgerton writer Julia Quinn said last year that while she didn't write Francesca as a neurodivergent character, she was thrilled some autistic fans of the show could relate to the newly-married sister, who often needs a quiet space and can struggle with societal conventions.Dodd concurs. \"The writers said it was something they did discuss in the writers' room,\" she says.\"It wasn't something that me or Victor were aware of, it must have just been on the page and that's kind of how it came out in our performances.\"But to acknowledge feeling slightly different to your siblings and how society is going about and if that's not fitting quite right with you... it's really important that everybody sees themselves represented on that screen so if we've included another group of people, then that's amazing.\"NetflixYerin Ha plays newcomer Sophie - could she be the one who can finally tie Benedict Bridgerton down?While Francesca and John's storyline may be an eye-opener, the main focus this season is the love life of wayward bohemian Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), who falls head-over-heels for a mystery woman called Sophie (Yerin Ha) at his family's masked ball.The Cinderella-style narrative takes us into another realm - the servants' quarters.\"We've never seen the downstairs world of Bridgerton before... and the real problems that those characters have to face and how they navigate it,\" Ha tells the BBC.Elsewhere, Katie Leung plays the archetypal wicked stepmother role, Lady Araminta Gun, a newcomer to Mayfair.Leung first found fame as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter film franchise but says that joining the Bridgerton family was \"different\".She tells us: \"[It was] less overwhelming than it once was because I'm older. It's 20 years since I was in Harry Potter and that was my first job, so I didn't really know what I was stepping into. \"I think it's all perspective and age and experience, and my priorities have shifted,  my sense of self and who I am... so it's really hard to compare... but what I will say is that... I feel more at ease, and more comfortable.\"While part of Bridgerton's success lies in its ability to bring in new talent each series to keep things fresh, the core cast are the gel that holds everything together.Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte) and Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury) have been there since the start and their friendship - between sovereign and subject - is put to the test in the latest series when the Queen refuses to let Lady Danbury go on holiday because she fears she won't manage without her.NetflixQueen Charlotte and Lady Danbury remain staples of the showAndoh explains: \"I think it is really the first time that the Queen has gone: 'You are my subject and you will do what I want.' And Danbury's gone: 'Oh, I'm [just] your subject? Right, you will get subject.' And I think it really frightens them both. So they have to find a way back to the friendship.\"The way back is for Lady Danbury to seek out a lady-in-waiting to keep Her Majesty company when she is away - but she questions if she is selfish for trying to put herself first.\"I do think that women do a lot of facilitating,\" Andoh adds. \"But taking the time to go, 'hello, what do I like? What do I think? What would I like to do?' It's not a habit that we're generally used to exercising. \"And we should... manage people's expectations as well -  you're not always on hand, you're not always available, that you actually have your own thoughts and feelings and things you'd like to do with your time.\"Part one of Bridgerton series four lands on Netflix on Thursday 29 January. Part two will become available on Thursday 26 February.More on this story",

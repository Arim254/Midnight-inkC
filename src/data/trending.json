    "body": "Dyche and Mancini contenders after Forest sack PostecoglouImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ange Postecoglou failed to win any of his eight matches in charge of Nottingham ForestNottingham Forest head coach Ange Postecoglou was sacked just 17 minutes after the side's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea at the City Ground on Saturday. The Australian's dismissal - 39 days after his appointment on 9 September - means Postecoglou's stint at Forest is the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. Sources have told BBC Sport that Forest have made contact with ex-Everton boss Sean Dyche with a view to replacing Postecoglou, while former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is another possible candidate. Postecoglou failed to win any of his eight matches in charge of Forest, with two draws and six defeats across all competitions. Forest collected just one point from Postecoglou's five Premier League matches in charge, leaving the side one point above the relegation zone in 17th on his departure and in the bottom three following the day's later games.\"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that after a series of disappointing results and performances, Ange Postecoglou has been relieved of his duties as head coach with immediate effect,\" a Forest statement read. \"The club will make no further comment at this time.\"Postecoglou's staff, including Nick Montgomery, Mile Jedinak and Sergio Raimundo are also expected to leave.Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis was at the City Ground to witness the defeat by Chelsea but was pictured leaving his seat around the 67th minute. He did not deliver the news to Postecoglou, with a senior club official instead telling the 60-year-old - although that is not unusual. Postecoglou then said goodbye to his players, leaving them with an apology it did not work and that he was not able to deliver what he was brought in to do.Many fans headed for the exit when Reece James put Chelsea 3-0 up six minutes from time, and there were jeers from the home fans at the full-time whistle.Media caption, Postecoglou only getting five games is 'ridiculous' - RichardsWho next for Forest?Postecoglou's departure means Forest are searching for their third manager already this season, having sacked Nuno Espirito Santo just three matches into the campaign.Forest have made early contact with former Everton manager Sean Dyche with a view to replacing Postecoglou, while ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is another contender.Dyche has been out of work since being sacked by the Toffees in January, while Macini's last role was in charge of Saudi Arabia's national side. Mancini has Premier League experience, having led City to the Premier League title in 2012. While talks have been held with Dyche, sources indicate that an agreement is not a foregone conclusion. There is also major internal support for Fulham manager Marco Silva, but he is understood to have a 'significant' release clause in his contract which provides an obstacle for Forest.Importantly, Mancini and Dyche are out of work and available without the need to pay for their release.Postecoglou's departure after 39 days in charge means he has broken Les Reed's record for the shortest reign - in terms of days in charge -  of any permanent managerial appointment in Premier League history.Reed spent 40 days in charge of Charlton Athletic in 2006 and was sacked having one just one of his eight matches in charge in all competitions.Sam Allardyce, who managed 30 days in charge of Leeds United, was an interim appointment at Elland Road. Former Crystal Palace boss Frank De Boer still holds the record for the fewest matches managed by a permanent appointment in the Premier League, having overseen four games in charge at Selhurst Park. Postecoglou managed Forest five times in the Premier League. The Australian was informed of his sacking after speaking to his players in the dressing room following the defeat against Enzo Maresca's side.\"Ange came in after the game, debriefed the game and then I went out to do some running, I came back and news had broke that he had gone,\" Forest defender Ryan Yates told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"Everybody has to take responsibility. I think it would be unfair to pin it on anybody. We have to look ourselves in the mirror and dust ourselves down and go again because things in football can change really quickly.\"'Never seen anything like it' - analysis BBC Radio 5 Live reporter Lee Blakeman was waiting in the tunnel at the Forest Ground for post-match interviews when the news emerged that Postecoglou had been sacked.\"I've never seen anything like it in my 15 years of covering football for the BBC,\" said Blakeman.\"I came down from the stands, made my way to the tunnel and as I arrived another broadcaster just mouthed to me 'he's been sacked'.\"A statement dropped at the same time on the club's social media channels. \"Down here it was just frantic activity. Ange Postecoglou was seen leaving the dressing room. The media team were on their phones. \"The players were led out of the dressing room to attend a meeting with representatives of the club's board. \"Media people were asking were we going to get anyone to speak to. There was just glum expressions of anybody wearing a Nottingham Forest badge.\"'Marinakis must take responsibility' Former England captain Alan Shearer believes Marinakis must take a share of the blame for Postecoglou's sacking.\"Ultimately the results haven't been good enough and that is on Ange. But the owner has to take some responsibility too. He chose Ange, it was his appointment,\" Shearer told BBC Sport.\"How can you go from a manager in Nuno with one style of play to someone like Ange who everyone knows wants his teams to play in a completely different way?\"Nuno guided Forest to seventh in the Premier League last season, having spent much of the campaign battling for a Champions League spot. Forest had the joint-fourth best defence in the division, conceding 46 times in 38 matches. Postecoglou's Tottenham, by contrast, scored 64 to Forest's 58, but conceded 65 times to finish with a -1 goal difference. \"It was inevitable but I don't think it's right,\" former Manchester City defender Micah Richards told BBC Sport.\"He was only given eight games and a contrast of styles was always going to be a factor.\"Forest went from one of the best counter-attacking managers to one who wanted to be more expansive - it was never going to work straight away.\"Postecoglou is a good manager but it's possible his media outbursts haven't helped. It looked like he could have been the right fit but more time was needed.\"The interesting thing now is - will the next manager be short term or long term? What are Forest trying to be - was last season a one-off?\"I know Tottenham finished fifth in Ange's first season but if you're going off Ange's record last season, he should never have been appointed by Forest.\" Postecoglou's torrid reignWhen Postecoglou arrived at the City Ground, Forest were 10th in the Premier League and on the cusp of playing in Europe for the first time in three decades.Marinakis said Posetcoglou's experience at the \"highest level\" along with \"his desire to build something special\" made him a perfect fit for the club.But it was far from a perfect start for Postecoglou, as Forest were beaten 3-0 away at Arsenal in his opening match.A poor start was cemented when Forest were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Swansea City, when they threw away a 2-0 lead in Wales. Draws with Burnley in the Premier League and Real Betis in the Europa League did little to quieten a growing discontent.The bubbling anger spilled over after a 3-2 defeat at home to Midtjylland in the Europa League, when a section of Forest supporters chanted \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" towards the former Celtic boss. Postecoglou was defiant after a 2-0 defeat by Newcastle before the international break, saying: \"I love a fight\" in the face of questions about his job.But a 3-0 defeat by Chelsea at home proved a defeat too far for Postecoglou, who has now been sacked twice in the last five months by Premier League clubs.

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCThe Daily Mail runs two \"royal bombshells\". The first is a claim that \"Epstein set Prince up with second sex abuse victim\", and the second states that \"Andrew told the Met to dig up dirt on Virginia\". There have been \"calls for police probe\" as it says an \"email reveals he procured private data for smear campaign\".The Sunday Telegraph echoes the Mail and relies on its reporting for its headline that \"Andrew sought to dig up dirt on Giuffre\". The prince \"asked his taxpayer-funded police bodyguard to investigate sex abuse accuser\", it writes. Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to \"cut 40p tax rate\", according to The Telegraph. This puts him \"at odds\" with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.The Sunday Mirror also has a Royal exclusive. It says \"revelations\" in the posthumous book by Virginia Giuffre were the \"final straw for King\", calling them \"Virginia's revenge\". Ms Giuffre alleged she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was aged 17 in 2001 at the London home of his partner Ghislaine Maxwell, who is charged with grooming and sex trafficking girls for abuse by the paedophile financier Epstein. The prince made a payment to Ms Giuffre in an out-of-court settlement in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him. He denies all the accusations against him. Ms Giuffre died earlier this year by suicide.The Daily Star details the \"bombshell claim in late Virginia Giuffre's memoir\" that Prince Andrew had insisted she \"sign a gagging order to avoid embarrassing Queen Elizabeth\". In yet another Royal exclusive, The Sun on Sunday says \"Andrew axes Fergie party\" in \"new Royal shock\". Sarah Ferguson's \"66th birthday bash\" was \"cancelled as crisis over Epstein grew\" for the Prince.The Observer's front page is dominated by a snap of former BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis's interview with Prince Andrew. The headline reads \"he lied to me about Epstein\".The Sunday Times also has a royal story, saying that Prince William \"wants to go further on Andrew and will ban him from coronation\" when he becomes king. The paper follows up on the ongoing China spy case, saying a \"spy suspect was stopped with suitcase of cash\" after flying into Heathrow from China. It also claims that Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's partner Laure Ferrari is \"embroiled in a criminal investigation involving allegations of fraud\" at the think tank where she served as executive director.\"Thousands of perverts\" are \"to be freed from jail early\" writes the Sunday Express. They say \"Labour's sentencing shake-up 'puts public at risk'.\" Related Internet Links",

    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "The US State Department says it has \"credible reports\" that Hamas is planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which it says would violate the ceasefire agreement.A statement released on Saturday said a planned attack against Palestinians would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement and \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\".The state department did not not provide further details on the attack and it is unclear what reports it was citing.The first phase of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel is currently in progress - all living hostages have been released and bodies of the deceased are still being returned to Israel.Also part of the agreement, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Washington said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the statement said.Hamas has not yet commented on the statement.President Donald Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.The videos showed several men with guns line up eight people, whose arms were tied behind their backs, before killing them in a crowded square.BBC Verify could not confirm the identity of the masked gunmen, though some appeared to be wearing the green headbands associated with Hamas.On Saturday, Israel said it had received two more bodies from Gaza that Hamas said are hostages, though they have yet to be formally identified.So far, the remains of 10 out of 28 deceased hostages had been returned to Israel.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPrince Andrew's removal from the last vestiges of royal life has not only reshaped his future - it's sending ripples through his family too.His ex-wife has now lost her duchess title and will simply be known as Sarah Ferguson.Their daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie, will continue to have the title of princess as scandal surrounds their parents.Prince Andrew lost use of his Duke of York title over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.So, what does life after the royal shake up look like for the women of the York Family?For Ferguson, 66, the change will be the most visible.For all these years, she has kept the courtesy royal divorcee title Sarah, Duchess of York. Now, she reverts to her maiden name of Ferguson.And while arguably we've always referred to her as \"Fergie\", royal commentator Richard Palmer said that will \"no doubt\" have an impact.\"She will have lost a bit of cachet over this,\" he said. \"She certainly does use the title – even her Twitter bio is @SarahTheDuchess.\"But the loss of her title may impact her much less than the scandal she's facing separately about her own links with Epstein.Accuser's brother urges King to strip Andrew of prince titleSarah Ferguson dropped from multiple charities over Epstein emailAfter all those scandals, why did Andrew quit his titles now?Last month, several charities dropped her as patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.\"I think as far as Sarah is concerned, her own recent controversy involving the email she is said to have sent Epstein is what has had the biggest impact for her of late,\" said royal commentator Victoria Murphy.\"Prior to that, she had sidestepped the firing line of the controversy around Epstein and I think may have continued to do so, albeit without calling herself Duchess of York, had that not happened.\"Away from her philanthropy, Ferguson also has various business ventures.And these, too, are more likely to be affected by the Epstein controversy than any change in title, says Murphy.\"I would say it's likely they will be impacted by the revaluations of her own contact with Epstein, in the same way her charity work was and the fact that charities didn't want to be associated with her.\"But Ferguson has been a great survivor in royal circles. She's kept bouncing back.Even though she split from Prince Andrew more than three decades ago, she has remained his strong supporter and still lives in his Windsor estate.The Christmas before last, she was back in the royal fold, joining a royal Christmas gathering in Sandringham for the first time in decades, despite the fact that she and her ex-husband were not working royals or allowed to be part of official royal events.That ability to bounce back may help her this time too.\"She's the ultimate survivor and master of reinvention,\" said royal author Katie Nicholls.\"Not only has she been reaccepted by the public, but the late Queen Elizabeth II brought her back into the fold, and Charles is also very fond of her.\"Nicholls argues that over the years Ferguson has been through \"much worse\" and won't be too impacted by the loss of her title.\"Having been a royal outcast for all these decades, she's learnt not to attach too much weight to things like that.\"For the couple's two daughters, Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, there's no formal change.They will still be known as princesses, which they have been entitled to since birth.There is also no change to the line of succession.Andrew remains eighth in line to the crown, followed by his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, in ninth and twelfth place respectively.But in reality their positions are \"low down\" and will likely become much further down as time goes on, says Murphy.\"So practically, their positions have little meaning for the future,\" she says.King Charles III's closest family and line of successionBeatrice and Eugenie are also currently non-working royals, and while they do sometimes take on roles – Princess Eugenie was recently announced as a mentor for the King's Foundation's 35 under 35 network, for example - Murphy also says she \"can't see a world\" in which they would step up into royal duties in any official way.\"I don't think that was ever really on the cards, and I certainly don't see it as an option,\" she said.They have also benefited from all of the contacts their parents have made over the years, says Palmer. And while Andrew still remains a prince, losing the dukedom could have a knock-on impact there.Prince Andrew will also no longer join the King and the rest of the royal family at Christmas at Sandringham, but it's possible his daughters will still attend, says Palmer.\"As far as Beatrice and Eugenie go, I think there's an appreciation of the fact that this scandal doesn't involve them, and it's not fair for it to impact them directly in the independent lives they are carving out for themselves,\" says Murphy.\"Their daughters are most unfortunate victims, they've had to suffer in silence and have been dignified in their silence,\" adds Nicholls.\"It can't be easy to see their parents dragged through something like this, and they remain very much loved nieces of the King. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them at Christmas occasions in the future. They're largely untarnished.\"Ultimately, there seems to be little doubt that the person who will be most affected by all of this will be Prince Andrew himself.For a man who always liked the trappings of royalty, the pomp and the ceremony, the loss of his titles is deeply humiliating.So to not have those, on a personal level, will really matter.",

Her son admitted he \"knew quite early on I was beaten\". His pumpkin weighed a measly 2.9 stone (19kg).Ms Crickmore called her winning vegetable Sirius, \"because that's the brightest star in the sky\". Shaun Whitmore/BBCMs Crickmore warned her son \"you know I'll win this competition\"Mr Crickmore said he had always been fascinated by pumpkins, but it had been years since he had grown any. So this year, having decided \"there's nothing worse than seeing pathetic little pumpkins\", the farmer bought three seeds from a professional grower specialising in giant plants based in the United States.They were initially raised as seedlings in his mother's greenhouse, before he \"chose the two better looking specimens\", offering her the third one, he said. Shaun Whitmore/BBCMr Crickmore with the pumpkin he managed to produceMs Crickmore told him: \"You know I'll win this competition.\"Her competitive streak comes from her own mother and she has passed it on to her sons, she said.Her tactics included covering the plant up if the growing conditions were too hot, cold or wet.She also sneaked into Mr Crickmore's pumpkin patch at 06:00 one morning to steal pollen, admitting: \"They caught me doing it.\" \"It's because I had the female pumpkin, but I didn't have any male flower and I thought, 'ahh I know where there is a male flower' - I ripped the petals off and it worked.\"Pumpkins need to be pollinated to produce fruit. Mr Crickmore said they planned to re-run the competition next year. \"I know what mother's tactics are now - or maybe I'll give her one of the not-so-good seeds,\" he said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "16 hours agoJohn SudworthKyivReutersTrump says he has faith in Putin, but Zelensky does notOne word sticks out in the Ukrainian leader's description of his latest high-stakes foray into the nerve-centre of American power.His White House conversation with President Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelensky wrote on X, was \"pointed\".But we don't need to parse his semantic description of the exchange to know that this was not the meeting that the Ukrainian side had been expecting.If the old British adage holds true that a week is a long time in politics, then Zelensky appears to have set a new record.A short transatlantic flight, it seems, is now an age.As they set off for Washington on Thursday, the Ukrainian side was in high spirits.Listen to the words of Ruslan Stefanchuk, the speaker of Ukraine's parliament – effectively the country's second in command – and a politician fiercely loyal to Zelensky.In an interview with the BBC shortly before the president's plane took off, Stefanchuk described the trip as a \"very important historical moment\".The meeting, he said, would leave the world in no doubt that Trump \"finally understands that Putin is a liar, he can't be trusted, and actions are needed to stop the war\".And, he appeared to suggest, the crucial question for Ukraine – whether Trump would agree to its use of American long-range Tomahawk missiles - was close to being \"solved\".But it was as Zelensky's flight was in the air that news of the two-and-a-half-hour Trump-Putin phone call began to emerge and, before its wheels were even on the Washington tarmac, we had the announcement that another summit between the two was in the offing.The Ukrainians descended the steps, to be met with a low-key American greeting, and with their optimism, like a piece of waylaid luggage, lost somewhere en route.Trump tells BBC Putin 'wants to make a deal', cites threat of TomahawksJust a few weeks ago, the US president appeared to be running out of patience with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting he thought he might be stringing him along, that his continuing attacks on Ukraine were \"crazy\" and that he was growing \"very angry\" with him.But Friday's meeting confirmed that the sense of frustration was gone.\"I think he wants to make a deal,\" Trump said, and then proceeded to repeat some of his old talking points, framing the conflict as, in essence, a personal gripe between two leaders.\"There's a lot of bad blood,\" he said.Zelensky has learned from bitter experience that there are great risks in being seen to challenge Trump inside the walls of the White House.And so, the underlying tension was - once again - palpable as Trump, his secretary of state, the war secretary and treasury secretary looked on sternly, while prominent members of the MAGA (Make America Great Again)-leaning media clustered around the back of his chair.As expected, Zelensky was careful to offer effusive praise for the host's prowess as a peacemaker and to repeatedly express his gratitude.Flattery is the currency of diplomacy in Washington nowadays.But Zelensky also made it clear he did not share Trump's apparent confidence that Russia is acting in good faith.\"We understand that Putin is not ready,\" he said.The outcome, though, appears to have been a foregone conclusion.Trump ended the day insisting that the war should simply be frozen on the existing battle lines and both sides should simply \"go home to their families\".For Ukraine and its allies, the conflict is not a personal dispute but a war of aggression being fought by an authoritarian state, with imperial ambitions, against a European democracy.Ukraine wants the US Tomahawk missiles to help it pressure Putin into genuine negotiations, and it wants US security guarantees to make sure he is forced to abide with any future peace settlement.Zelensky left the White House without either of those things.Zelensky fails to secure Tomahawk missiles at talks with TrumpWatch: How might Tomahawk missiles change the Ukraine-Russia war?What do Ukrainians think of it all?In a suburb of Kyiv, recently hit by two Russian missiles, I spoke to some of the residents still working to repair the damage to their homes and businesses.I asked Volodymyr Tsepovatenko - still busy fixing windows that were blown out of the small shop he owns – for his views on where Ukraine stands after the latest White House meeting.Volodymyr Tsepovatenko has been fixing windows at a shop he owns after Russian missiles struck a suburb in Kyiv \"If we make a peace deal now,\" he told me, \"Russia will start to prepare a new more professional war against Ukraine, or maybe other countries.\"\"I see one way for our safety and it's to destroy the possibility of Russia occupying or fighting any country in Europe.\"Ukraine needs to keep fighting, he said.Oleksandr Vilko's car was destroyed by the blast wave when the missiles struck. He is not too worried, he says, about the decision on the Tomahawks.\"The only power who decides what's going to be next is our army,\" he told me.Oleksandr Vilko's car was damaged by the blast wave when the missiles struckWhile Ukraine is grateful for any assistance provided so far, he said, it was Washington's sovereign right whether or not to give Ukraine its own long-range missiles to fight back.But with or without them, Ukrainians would fight on, he said.\"It's almost the fourth year of the war with the biggest country in the whole world,\" he said.\"And still we survived.\"",

    "body": "Will giving up his titles really make much difference for Andrew?5 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaWe're unlikely to see Prince Andrew at a royal public event now for at least six months. And then maybe only once or twice a year.Banned from royal Christmas celebrations at Sandringham he won't be on the annual church walk. It could be April 2026, at the Easter church service, before he reappears on such a family occasion, maybe longer.But when he resurfaces, how much will his life have really changed, despite the drama of the loss of his titles and honours?The move against Andrew followed a public outcry for some kind of sanction and there's certainly been a powerful symbolic message of displeasure - but will it really end the accusing headlines and will his daily life be much affected?PA MediaPrince William has not shown any enthusiasm for being seen with AndrewBuckingham Palace will hope that this will be seen as a decisive intervention, ending the drip-drip of scandal.The King was in Scotland when Andrew made his decision on giving up his titles and reportedly spoke to his brother on the phone.He had consulted Prince William, who has all the warmth of an ice age for his uncle Andrew. When William is eventually on the throne, Andrew's royal appearances might be reduced from rare to never.It had been William who had already intervened to stop Andrew from walking in the Order of the Garter procession.There has been a colossal loss of reputation for Prince Andrew and he'll keenly feel no longer being able to use the Duke of York title and to take part in the Order of the Garter. He's become a persona non-garter.It's a deep blow to his pride. But on a day-to-day basis, he's still a prince and he's still living in a mansion in Windsor. Royal Lodge has got a lease until 2078, so if he leaves it will be his own choice.Living with him still will be his ex-wife, who is now also an ex-duchess. They've gone back to the position when they first met, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew.His downfall has been driven by his links with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But while Andrew has lost his status, if he ever looks at the infamous photo of him and Virginia Giuffre, everyone else in the picture - Ms Giuffre, Ghislaine Maxwell - and the person who was claimed to have taken it - Epstein - are either dead or in prison. The prince is the only one who has walked away.He can still spend his days watching aviation videos or TV shows. His family life with his daughters, who are still princesses, can continue unchanged.His statement about not using his titles, more or less a resignation letter, didn't have any flicker of remorse, continuing to assert his sense of duty and honour. So no change there.PA MediaSarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew will still be together at Royal LodgeWhen Andrew had to stop being a working royal, in the wake of his Newsnight interview, there was an expectation that he might take the time-worn approach of quiet contrition and some charity work, to gradually regain public respect.Instead he showed no sense of regret. A royal insider, asked about Andrew's chances of a dignified return to public life, simply said to me: \"The grand old Duke of York, he gave 12 million quid, to someone he never met, for something he never did.\"It meant he had never really accepted responsibility for what had happened. Several years later, the only thing that's changed is that he's no longer the Duke of York.The intense pressure applied this week by the Palace to Prince Andrew to accept the loss of titles was driven by two key factors, according to royal sources.First, the Palace wanted to stop the cacophony of terrible headlines about Andrew that kept drowning out the rest of the Royal Family's work. They wanted a line drawn under the scandals.And second, there was genuine disquiet at the discovery that Prince Andrew had stayed in touch longer with Epstein than he had previously admitted. If that part of his account was unreliable, what else might emerge?Getting Prince Andrew to renounce the use of his titles, under the threat of forcibly taking them away, was an attempt to publicly show that the Palace was taking this seriously. They would put an end to his remaining links with royal life.Although this made headlines around the world, it won't stop the underlying questions about Prince Andrew and Epstein and the accompanying headlines.This week will see the publication of the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who claimed to have been forced to have sex with Andrew.The prince has emphatically denied any wrongdoing, but the questions for Andrew about Ms Giuffre and Epstein seem to be getting louder than fading away. There could also be questions about what the Palace did or didn't know about Andrew and Epstein's circle.Whether he's called a prince or an ex-duke, he could still be caught up in the public and political pressure to reveal more documents about Epstein, particularly in the United States.PA MediaKing Charles had been in Scotland when Andrew had agreed to lose his titlesThe press will keep pulling on other threads, like Andrew's business dealings with China. Whatever the Palace hopes, the headlines are unlikely to stop.At the centre of it all is Prince Andrew, saying nothing now apart from his terse statement, written through gritted teeth, about his titles.Before his Newsnight interview in 2019 he had been much more open to talking to the media. I remember speaking to him at an event in 2017 encouraging entrepreneurs.Looking back it seems unintentionally prophetic.\"One of the things that I was taught at school was that the best way of being successful is to fail,\" he'd said.\"If you can learn about failure, and do it in such a way that it's a safe environment… then you will have learnt something, you will have experienced something.\"How many times did you put your finger in the plug socket as a small child and say 'ow' - and you never did it again.\"If you did it a second time, you'd think that was really stupid. They've failed and then they've learned what not to do next time,\" said Prince Andrew.\"You're always stronger from failure.\" Is that a lesson he was ever good at learning?",

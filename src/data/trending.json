    "body": "The best time to turn on the heating – according to you9 hours agoEmer Moreau and Connie BowkerAbbi LilyAbbi, who makes personal finance content on social media, says she and her partner delay turning the heating on, to save moneyThere are few things British people love more than talking about the weather, and as winter approaches, this can often take the form of: \"Have you turned the heating on yet?\"You may get different answers depending on where in the country you are - the northern and western parts of the UK are generally colder and wetter than the east and south. But temperatures across the country are due to drop this weekend. And on Sunday the clocks go back, marking an official end to British Summer Time - and the return to darker evenings as winter draws in.So will you wait until a particular date to reach for the thermostat? Or until the temperature drops below a certain point?'We hold off for as long as possible'Abbi Lily, who makes personal finance content under the moniker abbitalksmoney, says she and her partner try to \"wait until the absolute last minute\" before turning the heating on, in order to save money.They're currently using blankets and jumpers to stay warm \"so we can hold off as long as possible\", but they don't have a hard and fast rule about when the heating goes on.When she spoke to the BBC earlier this week, Abbi said it was still quite mild where she lives near Bournemouth.\"I'm wearing shorts today!\" she said.The Energy Saving Trust recommends setting the thermostat to anywhere between 18C and 21C for most people.The World Health Organisation (WHO) also recommends 18C for \"healthy and well-dressed people\". For older people, children and people with illnesses or disabilities, the WHO recommends 20C.Some people might keep a closer eye on the outside temperature, instead of their thermostat. Simon King, the BBC's lead weather presenter, says 15C tends to be the magic number. \"If the temperature is regularly below this for a few days or more, that is when people tend to switch their heating on.\"Temperatures across the UK are expected to fall this weekend as colder air from the Arctic spreads in, he adds.Cold arctic air will affect all of the UK this weekendRather than monitoring the temperature too closely, Gemma Bird from Essex waits until a certain date to turn the heating on.\"Growing up, my mum would only let us turn on the heating on 1 November,\" says Gemma, who shares money-saving household tips on Instagram.\"I remember thinking I'd never be like that, but obviously with the cost of everything now, I say: 'Is it 1 November? No? Put an extra blanket on.'\" Indeed, for many households, the question of when the heating goes on is about money, not health or comfort.'Our Aga is like having a permanent fire in the house'Aimee Blakey lives with her husband Sean and their son in a detached 1980s house in Wiltshire. The couple both come from farming backgrounds, she says, where they were taught: \"If you're cold, you put a jumper on. If you're really cold, put a dressing gown on.\"Aimee had always wanted an Aga, but buying a new one was too expensive when they started renovating two years ago. They were able to get a second-hand one, which they're now \"obsessed with\".Aimee BlakeyAimee and Sean had a second-hand Aga installed in their home last yearAn Aga is an iron cooking range which absorbs heat and then releases it slowly, so the cooker stays warm even when it's not in use. Agas originally ran on slow-burning coal, but today's models are powered by gas, electricity or biofuel. They can be expensive to run but, for Aimee and Sean, it saves them money on heating costs.\"It's like having a fire permanently in the house,\" she says. They first used the Aga on 1 October, but haven't switched their oil boiler on yet.Aimee says she was worried about the cost of running the Aga when it was installed a year ago, but it's currently costing them less than the £100 a month they had budgeted for oil.\"Because it's oil we can fill it up at any time. We filled it up during the summer when it was cheaper.\"'In the US, we turn on the heating when it's cold. Over here, it's a hot topic!'American-born Olivia Carney lives in Greater Manchester with her British husband. She says she's amused by the \"unspoken competition of who can turn it on the latest\".\"In the US we kind of just turned it on whenever it was cold,\" Olivia, 33, says. But in the UK, \"it's a hot topic in the office\".\"There seems to be a clear divide of people waiting until the absolute last minute or people who are just like, 'Yeah, no, I'm not gonna be cold in my own house.'\"Olivia first turned the heating on in mid-October, with the thermostat set to 18C \"so when it warms up to that it turns off\".Olivia CarneyOlivia Carney finds the British obsession with the heating funnyCaitlin Robinson, who studies energy and infrastructure-based inequality at the University of Bristol, says bills are still much higher than they were before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, leading to a spike in the cost of gas and electricity.Dr Robinson says it can be \"tricky to give advice\" on lowering energy bills because most people are \"sensible\" and \"savvy\" anyway, especially if they're on a low income.Her research indicates that it's not just low-income households that are making considerable cutbacks on their heating, as evidenced through the \"record levels of energy debt\" in Britain.People struggling to pay their bills can experience heavy stress, Dr Robinson says.Mental health can also suffer if people aren't having people around to the house because they can't heat it, leading them to become socially isolated. Privacy, too, can be in short supply if families are only heating one or two rooms in a house and people have little space to themselves.Gemma, who works from home, wears tights under her clothes and swears by her electric blanket. \"I can turn [the heating] on if I have to, but obviously there are loads of people who can't, which is awful.\" More on this story",

Axel says this really brings a look to life.Prosthetics for beginnersAdding prosthetics to a more basic makeup look can really up the fear-factor.  Axel suggests starting off with things that are very easy to buy.“ and cotton wool can go a long way.”They suggest applying a layer of the latex, adding some cotton wool which should stick to it but still be mouldable, then add colour with makeup: “You can make scars from that, gashes or boils. You can really do a lot.”From fake blood to fashionSince appearing on Glow Up, Axel has been busy on a variety of big projects including a gory horror film. As the lead makeup artist they designed a rig of tubes, hidden under prosthetic skin, so when characters were \"attacked\", fake blood could spurt out of their fake wounds.Axel has also been working on makeup for the catwalk show of fashion designer, Jean Louie Castillo. This also has the spook factor Axel says. \"He [Jean Louie] loves to have special effects makeup creating ghouls that walk the runway. It's very gothic, very edgy, and right up my street.”Whether you're welcoming trick or treaters on your street, or off out to a ghoulish party, BBC Bitesize hopes you find the perfect inspiration to get your spook on this Halloween.All episodes of Series 1 to 7 of Glow Up are available on BBC iPlayerThis article was published in October 2025",

    "body": "9 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe bosses of Britain's biggest supermarkets have warned food prices could rise even further if higher taxes are imposed on the sector.Grocers including Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons signed a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget next month, along with Lidl, Aldi, Iceland, Waitrose and M&S.They claimed households would \"inevitably feel the impact\" of any potential tax increases on the industry, such as higher business rates for supermarkets.The Treasury said tackling food price inflation was a \"priority\" and said it was lowering business rates for \"butchers, bakers and other shops\".In their letter to the Chancellor, supermarket bosses said if the industry was to face higher taxes, \"our ability to deliver value for our customers will become even more challenging and it will be households who inevitably feel the impact\".\"Given the costs currently falling on the industry, including from the last Budget, high food inflation is likely to persist into 2026,\" they warned.\"This is not something that we would want to see prolonged by any measure in the Budget.\"Ahead of the chancellor's Autumn Budget next month, speculation is growing over her tax and spending policies.She is widely expected to increase taxes following gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on cuts to welfare spending, which have made it more difficult for her to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.After announcing tax rises of £40bn in her previous Budget in November, which included a hike in the amount employers are required to pay in National Insurance Contributions, Reeves said she was \"not coming back\" for more tax rises.But economists at the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have calculated a shortfall of £22bn in the public finances and suggested Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes.The think tank cited rising borrowing costs for the government, weaker growth forecasts, and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the tight position.Many industries in the run-up to the Budget often call on and lobby their views and position to the government, but rising food prices are once again putting pressure on people's finances.The cost of many staples has spiked compared with butter prices up by 19% and milk over 12% along with chocolate and coffee rising 15%, according to the Office for National Statistics.While higher taxes and minimum wage bills have hit supermarkets, food inflation has surged in part due to poor harvests globally, with disease and droughts affecting yields. Escalating trade tensions also have an impact.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which represents the UK's major supermarkets, said retailers were \"doing everything possible to keep food prices affordable\".\"But it's an uphill battle,\" she claimed, \"with over £7bn in additional costs in 2025 alone,\" citing higher taxes.The boss of Tesco, Ken Murphy, has previously said that \"enough is enough\" on business taxes.The UK's largest supermarket said the higher National Insurance rate had cost it £235m this year, however, Tesco has upgraded its earnings outlook for the year, with expectations of full-year profits of between £2.9bn and £3.1bn.Lidl revealed this week that its profits had surged threefold. Sales jumped by 7.9% as pre-tax profits hit £156.8m in the year to 28 February, up from £43.6m a year earlier.The chancellor has previously said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in her budget, though on Friday she refused to rule out raising income tax, amid speculation she is considering breaking a key Labour election pledge.Business ratesSupermarket bosses highlighted that part of the government's business rates reforms posed a problem for the industry, in particular the so-called business rates surtax, which is being levied on all large commercial premises.Business rates are a tax on non-domestic properties such as shops, pubs and offices.In last year's Budget, the government announced its intention to introduce two lower figures used to calculate such rates for retail, hospitality and leisure properties with rateable values below £500,000.Meanwhile, firms with properties with rateable values at and above £500,000 will pay a higher amount, which the government says will include the majority of large distribution warehouses, such as those used by online retail giants Amazon.It is expected that the chancellor will confirm the rates businesses will have to pay at next month's Budget, along with further details, which will come into force in April 2026.But the UK's supermarkets have argued large retail premises were a \"tiny proportion of all stores, yet account for a third of retail's total business rates\".They urged the chancellor to \"ensure that the proposed changes to business rates result in a significant reduction to the industry's rates burden\".\"The chancellor has rightly made tackling inflation her top priority, and with food inflation stubbornly high, ensuring retail's rates burden doesn't rise further would be one of the simplest ways to help,\" said Ms Dickinson.The Treasury said that business rates would be adjusted to reflect changes in the overall value of the tax base, \"so that the system continues to raise the same amount of revenue in real terms\".\"If the total value of rateable properties increases, the tax rate will generally fall,\" it added. \"This means that even if a specific property's RV goes up, its bill could still decrease if the reduction in the tax rate is large enough to offset the increase in value.\"Ultimately, what businesses pay after a revaluation depends on both the new RVs and the adjusted tax rate.\"",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said he is increasing tariffs on goods imported from Canada by 10%, after the province of Ontario aired an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan.The US president called the advert a \"fraud\" and lashed out at Canadian officials for not removing it ahead of the World Series baseball championship in a social media post on Saturday.Ontario's premier said he would take it down to allow trade talks with the US to proceed, after Trump withdrew - but that it would still run in the US over the weekend.Canada is the only G7 country that has not reached a deal with the US since Trump began seeking to charge steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners.The US has already imposed a 35% levy on all Canadian goods - though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.Trump said while travelling to Asia on Saturday that he was \"increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now\". Tariffs are paid by the companies that import foreign products, not the exporters themselves.Three-quarters of Canadian exports are sold to the US, and Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's automobile manufacturing.US-Canada trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said of the tariff increase: \"We stand ready to build on the progress made in constructive discussions with American counterparts over the course of recent weeks.\"We will remain focused on achieving results that benefit workers and families in both the United States and Canada, and that progress is best achieved through direct engagement with the US administration.\"Trump's decision comes after Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday that he would pause the anti-tariff advertising campaign \"so that trade talks can resume\", after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney.But he said it would still appear during games for the World Series, including between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers.Trump responded that the advert should have been pulled down \"IMMEDIATELY\". A spokesperson for Ford stood by his statement on Friday.The advert, sponsored by the Ontario government, quotes former US President Ronald Reagan, a Republican and icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".The video takes excerpts from a 1987 national radio address that focused on foreign trade.The Ronald Reagan Foundation, which is charged with preserving the former president's legacy, had earlier criticised the advert for using \"selective\" audio and video and said it misrepresented Reagan's address. It also said the Ontario government had not sought permission to use the footage.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words. It does however alter the order in which he made the comments.Ford had previously pledged to run the Reagan advert in every Republican-led district in the US.Both Trump and Carney will be attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, but Trump told reporters accompanying him on Air Force One that he had no intention of meeting his Canadian counterpart during the trip. Responding to the Trump's rate hike on Saturday, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it hoped \"this threat of escalation can be resolved through diplomatic channels and further negotiation\".\"Tariffs at any level remain a tax on America first, then North American competitiveness as a whole,\" the organisation's CEO, Candace Laing, told the BBC.The Reagan advert is not the only way that Ontario – home of the Toronto Blue Jays – is using the World Series as a platform to criticise Trump's tariffs.Ford and California Governor Gavin Newsom jokingly made bets about which team would win the series in a social media video on Friday.Both men repeatedly joked about tariffs in the video, with Ford pledging to send Newsom a can of maple syrup if the LA Dodgers - who are based in Newsom's state - win.\"The tariff might cost me a few extra bucks at the border these days, but it'll be worth it,\" he wrote.In response, Newsom asked Ford to resume allowing American-produced alcohol to be sold in province liquor stores, and pledged to send him \"California's championship-worthy wine\" if the Blue Jays triumph.They ended their exchange both declaring: \"Here's to a great World Series, and a tariff-free friendship between Ontario and California.\"",

    "body": "3 days agoPaul BurnellNorth WestBBCTom Boyd stacked shelves as a volunteer at his local Waitrose for four yearsAn autistic man who was told he had to stop stacking shelves at the Waitrose supermarket where he had volunteered for four years has now been offered a job by a rival chain.Frances Boyd said she was \"overwhelmed\" by how people had responded to her talking about her 28-year-old son's experiences at Waitrose's store in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester.Tom Boyd had been working unpaid there since 2021, accompanied by a support worker. When Frances asked in July if her son could be offered \"just a few paid hours\", Waitrose head office told her Tom's work experience placement had to end.Frances said: \"We've had some great news - Asda have offered him two five-hour paid shifts a week.\"'Raising awareness'She added: \"It's overwhelming and they are flexible to say if at any time he is struggling they are fine.\"How amazing that a company could do this.\"Tom received the backing of Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham, who posted on X that Tom had received \"truly terrible\" treatment and promised to \"support him to find another placement that works\".He said Greater Manchester Combined Authority \"would encourage all employers, including Waitrose, to sign up to our brand new Bee Neuroinclusive Code of Practice\".Speaking with Frances, who broke the news of Tom's job offer on BBC Radio Manchester, Burnham said: \"Good on you for raising awareness because we need a huge awareness campaign here.\"She accepted his on-air offer to be an advocate for the campaign.Speaking on Wednesday, a Waitrose & Partners spokesman said it worked with a number of charities to provide work experience and was \"well experienced in making reasonable adjustments to help people succeed at work\".\"We are sorry to hear of Tom's story and whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, we are investigating as a priority.\"Frances Boyd said her son \"deserved better\" after his placement was stoppedFrances said her son, who has limited communication skills, started at the Waitrose store as part of his skills development for the workplace further education course, and volunteered two mornings a week. She said he was \"so proud of his work\", which involved putting stock out and tidying the shelves, and was praised for his work ethic by managers.\"He gave over 600 hours of his time purely because he wanted to belong, contribute, and make a difference,\" she said. Frances praised and thanked staff at the store for supporting him and said the decision to end his association had been taken by Waitrose head office.She added: \"They included him and were absolutely brilliant.\"I think he was just under the radar - all was running smoothly until it went to head office.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "8 hours agoLiberal Democrats have signalled they intend to use their next Opposition Day debate to discuss \"officially removing\" Prince Andrew's Duke of York title and his \"continued use of Royal Lodge\", the Sunday Times reports. MPs will \"defy years of convention\" to discuss the royal's future, who the paper says faces a \"pincer movement from parliament and Buckingham Palace\" to formally strip him of his dukedom and banish him from the 30-room mansion in Windsor.An investigation into \"who trolled Virginia Giuffre\", the prominent accuser of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is the lead for the Observer. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is plotting a \"mansion tax raid on homes\", according to the Mail on Sunday. The paper reports she plans to impose a charge of 1% of the amount by which a property exceeds £2m, a \"class war plan\" which critics say would \"punish hard work and aspiration\". The chancellor's tax plans also lead the Independent, which reports that Reeves is \"under pressure\" to break a Labour manifesto pledge and tax the highest earners. It comes as the chancellor looks to plug a £40bn \"black hole\" in the Budget. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Labour plans to give workers a day-one right against unfair dismissal risks \"crippling the jobs market\", according to the government's \"favourite\" think-tank. The Resolution Foundation tells the paper that it will oppose plans that give \"little obvious gains to workers\". More than 90% of councils will house asylum seekers by the end of the year, leads the Sunday Express. Around 40,000 people will be given taxpayer-funded homes across England, the paper writes, \"as ministers ramp up efforts to close migrant hotels\". Comedian Ben Elton tells the Sunday Mirror that he \"saved the most celebrated brain in showbiz\" in 1992, after he took Stephen Fry to hospital following a \"cocaine binge\". At the time, doctors said Fry was \"minutes from death or brain damage\". Sunday People reports on the \"forest lair\" of Christian Brückner, the man investigated in connection to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Brückner has not been charged and denies any involvement in the case.\"Privates on parade\" is the splash for the Daily Star, which reports that the number of British troops accused of \"flashing\" has risen 300% in the past year. The Sunday Telegraph says the asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from prison on Friday tried \"four or five times\" to return to the facility. It quotes an eyewitness who says they saw Hadush Kebatu repeatedly turned away by staff, who instead directed him to a railway station. The paper says the episode has \"farcical echoes\" of the government's \"one-in, one-out\" policy, after one man deported under the scheme came back across the Channel, only to find himself again picked up by immigration officers.Prince Andrew \"faces humiliation in the Commons\", according to the Sunday Times. The paper says the Liberal Democrats will defy years of convention by raising the issue of the prince in Parliament, as calls grow for him to be permanently stripped of his Dukedom and his 30-room mansion in Windsor over his relationship with the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.The Sunday Express suggests that more than 90% of councils in England will be housing asylum seekers by the end of the year. The paper says it has seen Home Office documents showing the department needs to find accommodation for more than 66,000 people as it looks to shut down migrant hotels. A Home Office spokesperson is quoted as saying the government is considering the use of military bases and disused properties.The Mail on Sunday says the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is planning a new \"mansion tax\". According to the report, owners of properties worth at least £2m would face an annual charge of 1% of the amount by which it exceeds that value.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has told the Sunday Times that the UK would be in the line of fire if Russia were to attack a Nato country. In an interview with the paper, Tusk says he is \"shocked\" by what he calls the public complacency about the UK's safety. He also says that Ukraine is prepared to keep fighting Russia for another three years.The Sunday Telegraph says French detectives believe the theft of £76m worth of jewels from the Louvre in Paris was an inside job. Sources have told the paper that a member of the museum's security team was in contact with the people who are believed to have carried out the heist.Barristers have been told they're free to \"ditch their wigs\", according to a report in the Mail on Sunday. It says the Bar Council has described the horsehair headpieces - which have been part of court attire since the 17th century - as \"uncomfortable\" and \"impractical\" for some people.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoFundanur Ozturk,BBC News Turkish and Kawoon Khamoosh,BBC World ServiceBBCTurkish charity owner Sadettin Karagoz denies allegations that he sexually assaulted refugees who came to him for aidA Turkish charity owner at the centre of sexual abuse allegations, brought to light by a BBC investigation, has been arrested.BBC News Turkish revealed accusations that Sadettin Karagoz sexually exploited vulnerable women, promising them aid in return for sex. He denies all the allegations.Mr Karagoz set up his charity in Turkey's capital, Ankara, in 2014. Syrian refugees desperate for help said at first he seemed like \"an angel\".One of them, Madina, fled the Syrian civil war in 2016 and said that two years later, one of her children became critically ill and her husband abandoned her. Her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.Left to care for three children alone, she went to Sadettin Karagoz's organisation, which translates as the Hope Charity Store. It gathers donations for refugees such as nappies, pasta, milk and clothes.Mr Karagoz's organisation is based in the Altindag area of Ankara, which is home to thousands of Syrian refugees\"He told me: 'When you have nowhere to go, come to me and I will look after you,\" she says.But when she did, Madina says he changed. She describes how Mr Karagoz told her to go with him to an area in the office behind a curtain to get some supplies.\"He grabbed me,\" she says. \"He started kissing me… I told him to get away from me. If I hadn't yelled, he would have tried to rape me.\"Madina describes how she escaped from the building but Mr Karagoz later went to her home.\"I didn't open the door because I was terrified,\" she says, explaining that he threatened to have her sent back to Syria.Scared of repercussions, Madina says she never went to the police and did not tell anyone else what had happened.Mr Karagoz says his organisation has given vital supplies such as rice, milk and tinned tomato paste to refugees over the past decadeMr Karagoz, a retired bank worker, denies the allegations and has told the BBC that his organisation has helped more than 37,000 people. He says that the aid distribution area in the charity is small, crowded and monitored by CCTV so he could not have been alone with any woman.Over the years, his charity has gained widespread recognition and won a local newspaper award in 2020. It has been featured on national TV, and he says it has attracted support from national and international organisations. In March this year he changed its Turkish name to My Home-meal Association.In all, three women, including Madina, told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had sexually assaulted and harassed them. Seven other people, including two former employees of his charity, say they either witnessed or heard first-hand testimony of him committing acts of sexual abuse between 2016 and 2024.Nada says she went to Mr Karagoz because her family desperately needed supportAccording to 27-year-old Syrian refugee Nada, he said he would only give her aid if she went to an empty flat with him. \"If you don't, I won't give you anything,\" she says Mr Karagoz told her. Again, her name has been changed to protect her anonymity.She was with her sister-in-law and says they stormed out. But desperate to provide for her family, she explains she didn't know where else to turn, so went back.On one occasion, Nada says Mr Karagoz took her behind a curtain to get nappies for her son where \"he tried to touch my breasts\".Another time, she says that \"he came from behind and grabbed my hand… he forced me to touch his genitals\".Afraid of the stigma attached to sexual abuse and scared she would be blamed, Nada says she didn't feel she could tell anyone, even her husband.Batoul says an encounter with Mr Karagoz scared her and that afterwards she isolated herself at home and was afraid to open her door to anyone The third woman who told the BBC that Mr Karagoz had assaulted her is Batoul, who has since moved to Germany.A single mother, she too says she went to him for help. \"When I turned away to pick up the aid, he put his hands on my backside,\" she explains. \"I left the aid and walked out of the shop.\"These testimonies were not the first to surface against Mr Karagoz.In 2019 and 2025 he was accused of sexual harassment and assault, but on both occasions prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Police said neither victims nor witnesses were willing to come forward to make formal complaints.Some women told us they were afraid testifying could lead to them being harassed or deported.But after the BBC investigation, it is understood two other women came forward to report Mr Karagoz, and their testimony resulted in him being charged with sexual abuse. He is now in jail awaiting trial.Batoul says she is \"truly happy\" he has been arrested, \"for myself and for all the women who have suffered in silence and couldn't speak out because of fear\".She adds that she hopes it \"gives courage and strength to all women who are being exploited in any way\".Mr Karagoz says health conditions mean he is not able to engage in sexual activityBefore he was arrested, we put the allegations made by Madina, Nada, Batoul and charity workers to Mr Karagoz.He denied all the accusations and claimed if they were true, more women would have come forward.\"Three people, five people, 10 people [could complain]. Such things occur,\" he said. \"If you said 100, 200 [had accused me], then fine, then you could believe I actually did those things.\"He also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and showed us a medical report with details of an operation in 2016 to remove his left testicle. This meant he was not able to perform any sexual activity, he said.However a professor of urology and specialist in men's sexual health, Ates Kadioglu, told the BBC that having one testicle removed \"doesn't affect someone's sex life\".We put this to Mr Karagoz who insisted that sexual activity was \"not possible for me\".We also put it to him that sexual assault may be motivated by a desire for power and control. He responded by saying: \"I personally don't have such an urge.\"\"All we did was good deeds and this is what we get in return.\"Sadettin Karagoz said women who accused him of assault in the past did so because he had reported them to the police for being involved in illegal activities.All the women we spoke to denied they or their relatives were involved with crime and the BBC has seen no evidence to suggest that they were.",

    "body": "9 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsWatch: Dr Xand and Dr Chris on working with their 'annoying' twinA giant mug of instant black coffee and no food is not what you'd expect the host of a wellness podcast to have for breakfast.Yet it's what Dr Chris van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs alongside identical twin brother Dr Xand confesses to having.\"I'm approaching middle age so don't want to eat all day. My way of not eating all day is not eating breakfast,\" he says. It's this kind of honesty about not leading the perfect life and struggling with the stuff they know they should do but still don't, that makes them so relatable.The brothers are both medical doctors who've become household names through their TV and radio work - they present children's series Operation Ouch! and Dr Xand is one of BBC's Morning Live resident experts while Dr Chris is well known for his bestselling book Ultra-Processed People. On the podcast, they often disagree with each other over competing claims about health and wellbeing, much like they do in real life. Xand laughs after Chris says it's a hard job working \"with a brother like Xand who is so intensely annoying\".But really the brothers love working together and Chris admits that they started the podcast \"quite selfishly as we were just trying to answer our own questions\". \"But it turns out our problems are similar to everyone else's.\"They say the podcast has changed their lives for the better and share what they have changed about their behaviour over the course of more than 30 episodes.1. Don't obsess over eight hours sleep Getty ImagesLike most of us, the brothers assumed eight hours was the gold standard for sleep and anything less was a failure. Now, they're far less dogmatic. The brothers say a healthy range of sleep can be anywhere between six and 10 hours.\"There's so much anxiety around getting eight hours but some of the most important things in my life, like raising kids, I've done sleep deprived,\" says Chris.Realising that everything from winning wars to completing exams were often done with very little sleep, made them understand that sleep deprivation can sharpen your focus in the short term.Xand says this helped him \"shed all that anxiety\" around optimal sleeping patterns and times.\"It no longer dominates my life and I think about it a lot less.\" He also feels a lot more comfortable taking naps when needed and says he will sometimes \"have a 20 minute sleep if I'm exhausted\". Am I getting enough sleep?2. Pause before saying yes or noGetty ImagesThe pair both find saying \"no\" difficult and Xand says it can feel \"almost physically painful.\" They have now learnt the \"power of the pause\". If something does not require an immediate decision, they now ask for more time to think about it so they don't feel pressured into saying yes.Chris says this has helped him have difficult conversations he may otherwise have put off. However, he admits he's still figuring out how to be more forceful. \"I know I should do, but somehow I'm not and I know I need to focus on that.\" The podcast episode on this topic also taught them that they needed to work out what their values are and then weigh up whether requests fitted in with those. For Xand, his priority was spending more time with his wife and two sons. He has since managed to say no to a number of things that he would have otherwise gone along with for an easy life. \"I recently said no to a very big and important work thing even though there was a lot of pressure on me to do it, but it didn't fit with my other commitments and what I wanted to do.\"Should you say 'no' more often?3. Brush your teeth mindfullyHow to brush your teethOne of the most practical tips that has stuck with the brothers is how they brush their teeth. The small act has become a mindful task and Xand explains he's totally changed the way he brushes.\"My wife, Dolly, hasn't complained about my bad breath since the episode.\"I use brushes for flossing, hold my toothbrush at a different angle and I don't look at my phone while brushing.\" While Chris is shocked that his brother ever used his phone while brushing his teeth, he agrees with how powerful the changes have been. \"It's about the angle of the brush, being more gentle and having a better picture of what you're trying to achieve - you want to clean every surface of every tooth.\"How can I freshen my breath?4. Willpower doesn't existGetty ImagesMany people believe that struggling with diet, exercise or breaking habits is down to personal weakness, and Xand shares those feelings. \"I feel lazy and inadequate most of the time.\"I go to Manchester every week and I usually arrive late after a long train journey and I order a takeaway and do no exercise then I beat myself up about it.\" Their expert guest on this podcast episode, psychologist Kimberley Wilson, helped Xand understand that \"there's no such thing as willpower\".Willpower is not this magic thing inside you, instead your ability to stick to something is \"about the way you've arranged the world around you,\" he says.For example, by planning ahead and thinking about what you'll have for dinner, you can more easily ditch the takeaway and eat something healthy. Since the episode, Xand has managed to increase how much exercise he is doing, but still doesn't enjoy it. \"I just get on the exercise bike and have those negative thoughts while I do my workout,\" he says. Another simple change he's made is taking a bag of apples with him on his regular commute between London and Manchester, rather than buying unhealthy snacks on the train.Chris realised willpower wasn't about increasing your tolerance to distress and suffering, but simply being more organised.\"I've started batch-cooking which now releases time for me to do things like read with my daughter.\" How important is willpower?For all the changes they've embraced, the brothers are the first to admit they don't follow every bit of expert advice.Take sunscreen, for example. \"A dermatologist gave us really good advice,\" Dr Chris says, \"but there's something about the sun that feels so powerful. Academically, we know sun exposure is bad and causes cancer but we still find ourselves drawn to it.\" That tension - between what we know and what we do - is at the heart of their podcast. If there's one thing the doctors hope listeners take away from the show, it's that struggling with health isn't a personal failure.\"So much of your health and well-being isn't your fault,\" says Dr Xand. \"There are loads of forces trying to take your money, attention and time away from the things that matter. What we're trying to do is sweep that out of the way, help you identify your values and align your life with them.\"Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "'I sold cakes as a kid, then I got a Michelin star'5 days agoAida FofanaWest Midlands Paul FosterPaul Foster, pictured in the middle, said he always wanted to open a resturantA chef who went from being a kid baking cupcakes for doormen in pubs to running his own Michelin-starred restaurant is taking his love of cuisine to the internet.Paul Foster's culinary journey began in the comfort of Coventry pub kitchens run by his mum, where as a 10-year-old he would help to feed punters and bake.He went on to open SALT in Stratford-upon-Avon before taking the decision to close the restaurant after eight years of serving internationally-inspired fine dining amid cost-of-living pressures on customers, he said.He has since launched YouTube channel Food Unfiltered, exploring what goes on inside the kitchens of some of the world's best restaurants. He said owning his own restaurant was always the dream and it was a lifetime goal to achieve a Michelin star.And while he did contemplate signing up for another lease for SALT, he said he had decided it was time to move into food media.\"It was really sad,\" he said of the decision to close. \"Anyone in the industry knows people aren't eating out as much anymore. \"There's a squeeze of cost of living, and fine dining restaurants is a luxury.\"I've had an incredible eight years, I've achieved everything I wanted out of my career, and it was a pinnacle.\"He added: \"I always remembered that I didn't get into cooking for Michelin. I got into it for the love of food and the love of pleasing people.\"Listen on BBC Sounds: From pub kitchen to Michelin chefMr Foster said: \"My dream was always to have my own small restaurant. Having  worked in Michelin star restaurants all over the world, that was what I wanted to do; I wanted to bring something like that as close as possible to Coventry.\"He said the city - and its pubs - had been the stomping ground for a love of food to grow.\"One of [the pubs] was a live music venue. It was great [although] I couldn't sleep much because of the noise coming through but I was just obsessed with the environment of the kitchen, the atmosphere, heat and swear words,\" he said.As a 13-year-old, he tried recipes from the Gary Rhodes book Rhodes Around Britain and saw \"the pleasure on people's faces\", which turned his hobby into a passion.\"I thought 'that was worth two hours in the kitchen, just to see how much that pleased someone',\" he said.\"I knew there was something in it and I took it from there.\"More on this story",

    "body": "20 minutes agoJames ChaterMet Police released CCTV footage showing Hadush Kebatu in a library in Dalston Square, north London, on Friday eveningA migrant sex offender mistakenly released from an Essex prison was last seen in east London on Friday evening, the Metropolitan Police has said.Hadush Kebatu was spotted shortly before 20:00 in the Dalston area of Hackney, and extra police have been sent to the area as the search for the Ethiopian national enters a third day.He was also picked up on CCTV at a library in Dalston Square around two hours earlier wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag with pictures of avocados on it.Kebatu was set free from HMP Chelmsford in error four weeks after being sentenced for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex, while staying at an asylum hotel.He had been awaiting transfer from prison to an immigration detention centre ahead of his planned deportation, but an error saw him allowed to walk free from the facility. Prison sources have confirmed to BBC News that staff led him away and towards the train station. Kebatu also reportedly attempted to return to prison but was turned away.He was filmed in Chelmsford speaking to members of the public shortly after he was released, and police have confirmed he has approached several people seeking assistance. It is not clear if Kebatu, who speaks limited English, knows about the massive search under way for him.In a direct public appeal on Saturday evening, Cmd James Conway said police wanted to locate him \"in a safe and controlled way\".He added: \"You had already indicated a desire to return to Ethiopia when speaking to immigration staff. The best outcome for you is to make contact directly with us by either calling 999 or reporting yourself to a police station.\" The senior officer said Kebatu had access to funds, which BBC News understands includes cash which had been returned to him with his property when he left HMP Chelmsford, along with the £76 payment prisoners are entitled to on release.Police have also established that Kebatu has made a number of train journeys across the capital since being released.Essex Police were first made aware that he had been released in error at 12:57 on Friday, sixteen minutes after he had already boarded a train at Chelmsford, before getting off at Stratford, east London.Justice Secretary David Lammy has ordered an independent investigation into Kebatu's release, while HM Prison Service has instructed governors in England and Wales to implement additional checks before inmates are released by Monday.An officer has been suspended pending investigation but a senior prison staffer told BBC News the release was \"down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\". They continued: \"It's not just one prison office who's to blame. That would be unfair.\"Watch: Met Police Commander James Conway urges Kebatu to \"turn yourself in\"Kebatu's arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living since arriving in the UK on a small boat.In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work. Kebatu gave his age as 38 during a court appearance, but a judge said he had been seen information indicating he was 41.He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences last month and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already time in jail awaiting his trial. In total, he spent 108 days in prison.Kebatu was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.During his trial, the court heard it was Kebatu's \"firm wish\" to be deported. Under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.Watch: Bodycam footage shows Hadush Kebatu's arrestWriting in the Mail on Sunday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the incident showed that the UK's \"once-trusted institutions\", including the police and prisons, were \"disintegrating before our eyes\". \"Nobody who arrives by small boat should be free to walk our streets,\" he added.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the release was a \"level of incompetence that beggars belief\".A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.",

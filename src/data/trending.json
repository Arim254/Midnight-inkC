    "body": "Five talking points from round three of Six NationsMedia caption, Graham scores try for Scotland straight from restartByTom RostanceBBC Sport journalistEngland went from bad to disastrous, France didn't fire on all cylinders but had enough to maintain their Grand Slam challenge, Scotland dug deep for a big win and Ireland were just tremendous.Here are five players who provided talking points in the third round of the Six Nations, with a two-week break to come before round four...'Russell rocked up when it matters'Media caption, 'It was pretty easy' - Humble Russell analyses own tryThe opportunity and ability for teams to rewrite their own narratives in the space of just a few weeks is part of what makes the Six Nations so compelling.Lacklustre and outgunned in Rome in week one, Scotland are now France's biggest challengers after following up the Calcutta Cup demolition of England with a nailbiting, nerve-wrenching win in Wales.The hosts were 23-12 up with just over 20 minutes to go but Scotland roared back to win 26-23 after some brilliant quick thinking from fly-half Finn Russell.He switched the momentum of the match with a kick that caught Wales out and allowed Darcy Graham to score in the corner. Yet again, the Bath number 10 was the difference-maker.\"Big-game players turn up when it matters and Russell had moments when he bailed Scotland out,\" former Wales captain Sam Warburton told BBC Rugby Special.\"He was exceptional at managing the team when they were down in the game. He waits for the perfect moment to get involved.\"He plays what he sees, he has that licence and his clutch kicking was immense. The big-game player rocked up in the last 30 minutes, he was immaculate and a big part of the comeback.\"\"Scotland found a way to win ugly,\" added their former flanker John Barclay.\"They found solutions and ground their way in. In some ways that was the most important win they have had in a while. It has given them a strong position in the table.\"Up next? France at Murrayfield on Saturday,  7 March, and the chance to end Les Bleus' Grand Slam dreams after three successive wins.Dupont ' a huge influence' for FranceMedia caption, France ease to bonus-point win over ItalyFrance remain in the driving seat for a 20th title - third in five years - and can seal it with a bonus-point win in Edinburgh.They were made to graft by ever-improving Italy in Lille, but eventually streaked away to win 33-8, aided by another classy display from star scrum-half and captain Antoine Dupont.A brilliant kick set up the opening score for Louis Bielle-Biarrey, before Dupont then showed his defensive strengths during a dominant second-half spell from the visitors.\"It's perhaps unfair that we expect him to do outrageous things every week,\" said Barclay.\"He is coming back from a knee injury and was maybe a bit quiet in the first two games, but he really stepped up.\"You have to admire his ability to scan the play under pressure, see space and deliver the skill for France to score that first try. His physical side of the game is impressive, he makes tackles and does so much good stuff.\"He had a huge influence on the game which is what we have come to expect. \"France will be heavy favourites in Scotland but that is an exciting game. Perhaps only South Africa can match them for power at the moment.\"Meanwhile, Bielle-Biarrey became the first player in Six Nations history to score in eight successive matches. He has scored 13 tries in 12 Six Nations games and 24 in 25 overall. Quite the strike-rate.Should time be up for Ford?Media caption, England couldn't match Ireland intensity - analysisWhile Scotland's campaign has been revitalised by back-to-back victories, England's has been utterly derailed by two losses.They were blown away by Ireland at Twickenham as the men in green ran in five tries to embarrass Steve Borthwick's side 42-21.England entered the tournament with a settled-looking side, but now look a muddle with Matt Dawson calling for Fin Smith to replace George Ford at number 10.Warburton was confused by Ford's kicking - or lack of - against Ireland.He said: \"England are normally patient in their kick battle but Ford missed some kicks that were a real momentum killer.\"England are a kicking team and when they do it well they look really good. He won so much territory against Wales and in the last two games it's been the other end of the spectrum.\"Ford is an exceptional tactical kicker but he has not been kicking in the last two games and they have struggled as a result of it.\"\"I am surprised by England,\" added Barclay.\"We thought it was a shootout between them and France for a Grand Slam before the tournament. The most concerning thing is the nature of the defeats. Where are England now? We don't really know.\"The last two performances have thrown up a lot of question marks about selection. What's the best back three, who should play at centre, is George Ford the man at 10?\"Rewind a few weeks and you could name the team. It seems to have fallen apart a bit.\"Next up for England is a trip on Saturday, 7 March, to Rome that looks anything but inviting.Ireland's forgotten man becomes undroppableMedia caption, Ireland reignite title bid with record away win over EnglandIreland's resurgence was personified by Robert Baloucoune.The 28-year-old had not featured for Ireland since November 2022 because of injury, but he started and scored against Italy before scoring again in an all-action performance against England.The wing thought his international career was over but instead played a huge part in a famous win, troubling England speedster Henry Arundell with his work-rate.\"He was unbelievable,\" said Barclay. \"His willingness to work off the ball is how you win games.\"He put in dominant tackles, won turnovers. The mindset and energy he bought to the game away from home set the tempo.\"\"Ireland's desire and work-rate off the ball won them the game,\" added Warburton.\"Paul O'Connell's quote when I was on Lions duty with him was, 'Be the best at everything that requires no talent' -  and Ireland were that.\"Their attack looks like the one of old. They were super-organised and their aerial dominance was a launchpad. They were so efficient in the red zone and their speed of ball was too good, England couldn't recover from it.\"Ireland face Wales next in a Friday night feast in Dublin on 6 March.Wales hurt by individual errors againMedia caption, Should Scotland's winning try against Wales have stood?Wales' dismal run continued with a painful defeat that was summed up by Tomos Williams giving away a costly penalty for a croc roll.Wales have lost 24 of 26 internationals since October 2023 and the latest defeat was a 14th successive Six Nations loss in a record stretching back three years.Barclay added: \"Wales will be gutted. They had that game.\"In Test Match rugby the margins are tiny and in the last 15 minutes they gave away five penalties and a huge one was the croc roll.\"You might think that has to be grabbing someone around the head and neck and twisting them, but it's also about lateral movement. It's something they are trying to get out of the game.\"The penalty was costly and Scotland and Russell took full advantage, with their misery being compounded by the nature of George Turner's match-winning try.Scotland number eight Matt Fagerson was offside and obstructing Wales replacement prop Archie Griffin in the build-up to the score from a driving maul.Small margins - but can Wales now build on an improved display across the Irish Sea?",

    "body": "19 minutes agoPhanindra Dahal,BBC Nepali, in Kathmandu,andHafsa KhalilEPAA 24-year-old British man is among 19 people who were killed in a bus crash in Nepal, police say.The bus - which had been carrying tourists - had been travelling to the capital, Kathmandu, when it lost control and fell 200m onto the bank of the Trishuli river, in the country's central Dhading district, in the early hours of Monday morning.There were 44 people onboard including the driver, 25 of whom suffered injuries. The bus had been travelling from Pokhara, a popular tourist spot.Authorities say they are investigating the cause of the incident. The UK Foreign Office said it was assisting the family of the Briton who was killed.Nepalese police said they had so far identified nine of the bodies. Among the injured is a Chinese national and a New Zealander, Nepalese police said.All the injured had been taken to hospitals in the capital, they added. Children were among those onboard.Multiple teams were sent to the site, including police units, the army and a rescue team of divers, authorities said.Police spokesman Abinarayan Kafle said 17 people died at the scene, with two more dying while receiving treatment, BBC Nepali reported.Road accidents are relatively commonplace in Nepal, due to a range of factors including poor road maintenance and narrow paths in mountainous areas.In 2024, at least 14 people died after a bus travelling from Pokhara to Kathmandu fell into the Marsyangdi river in the Tanahun district.\"We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Nepal and are in contact with the local authorities,\" a Foreign Office spokesman told the BBC.Nepal is a popular destination for many international visitors, especially climbers, who travel there to access a key section of the Himalaya mountain range that includes Mount Everest.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoMitchell LabiakBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK is set to be among the countries worst hit if US President Donald Trump's 15% global tariff goes ahead, analysis has suggested.The British Chamber of Commerce told the BBC the UK would \"sit towards the bottom of league table\" of trade partners if Trump's announcement came into effect on Tuesday.On Friday, the US Supreme Court outlawed most of the global tariffs that Trump had announced last year, saying the president had overstepped his powers.This 15% levy does not affect tariffs the UK and US had agreed on specific sectors, such as steel, aluminium, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and aerospace, which represent most of the UK's trade with the US.The British Chamber of Commerce's president, Andy Haldane, told the BBC: \"The perversity of what happened of the weekend was that those who got good deals, the allies, have been most disadvantaged.\"Meanwhile, countries the Trump administration had heavily criticised, such as China and Brazil, would do best because the 15% tariff will be lower than the level they  currently pay, according to GTA's analysis.However, on Sunday, US trade representative Jamieson Greer said trade deals allies had negotiated still stood.He told CBS that he had spoken to the EU and other countries over the weekend.\"The deals were not premised on whether or not the emergency tariff litigation would rise or fall,\" he said.\"These deals are going to be good deals. We expect to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them.\"The legislation Trump has said he will use to impose his 15% tariff is different from the way in which tariffs on specific sectors are introduced.The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday also does not affect the sector specific tariff deals.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is eighth in line to the throneAustralia's prime minister has told Sir Keir Starmer his government would back plans to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Anthony Albanese expressed his support for such a proposal in a letter to the UK prime minister.Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", in October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The UK government is considering introducing legislation to remove him from the line of succession. It follows Andrew's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office on Thursday. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The former prince was released under investigation 11 hours after his arrest by Thames Valley Police.Albanese's letter reads: \"Dear Prime Minister Starmer, in light of recent events concerning Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, I am writing to confirm that my government would agree to any proposal to remove him from the line of royal succession.\"I agree with His Majesty that the law must now take its full course and there must be a full, fair and proper investigation.\"These are grave allegations and Australians take them seriously.\"Speaking after his brother Andrew's arrest, King Charles had said: \"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.\"Removing him from the line of succession would require an act of Parliament. This would need to be approved by MPs and peers, and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need the support of the 14 Commonwealth countries where King Charles is head of state, including Australia.Getty ImagesBuckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's plans to remove Andrew from the line of succession.On Friday, Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC that the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.The former prince was arrested at 08:00 GMT on Thursday at Sandringham, the King's Norfolk estate where Andrew has been living since leaving his Windsor home, Royal Lodge, in early February.Police searches at Sandringham concluded late on Thursday. It is understood they continued at the 30-room property in Windsor over the weekend, where several unmarked police cars were seen on Saturday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesOfcom has fined a porn company £1.35m for failing to introduce proper age verification measures on its websites.The media regulator said 8579 LLC's sites did not have \"highly effective\" methods to check UK visitors were over 18 and prevent children accessing the content.The fine - Ofcom's largest levied under the Online Safety Act (OSA) so far - comes after it began probing the firm \"within days\" of age check rules taking effect in July 2025.8579 LLC has also been fined a further £50,000 for not responding to Ofcom's information requests.According to Ofcom, the company failed to implement highly effective age checks on most of its porn sites between 25 July and at least 19 November 2025.The regulator says 8579 LLC must implement robust methods to check UK visitors are over 18 on one remaining site before 17:00 GMT on Monday, or face an additional £1,000 daily penalty.George Lusty, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said it had \"been clear\" adult sites needed to deploy robust age checks to protect children in the UK form seeing porn.\"Those that fail to do this – or ignore legally binding requests from us – should expect to face fines,\" he added.The regulator is also requiring 8579 LLC to provide Ofcom with a complete list of all sites it operates, after failing to respond to the regulator's information requests.It risks a further additional daily fine of £250 if it does not comply.Ofcom has already launched probes into many porn sites lacking age checks and handed down decisions, including fines, for some.Ofcom later said AVS had rolled out age checks on some of its porn sites.Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, said the OSA had \"not achieved its goal of protecting minors\".It also said the law had \"diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet\".The Act is a set of laws and duties online platforms must follow, that are implemented and enforced by Ofcom.Under its Children's Codes, platforms must also prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography.",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party5 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesKim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living in his opening speech to the congressNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement, which was made at a rubber-stamp party congress in Pyongyang on Sunday, comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled by dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea, which began on 19 February and is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress has been held once every five years in the last decade.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque to even the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".All eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance at the congress.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Believed to be 13 years old, she has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events, inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.Chinese president Xi Jinping called Kim to congratulate him on his re-appointment on Monday, saying he would work with Kim to \"write a new chapter in the China-North Korea friendship\", Chinese state media reported.Beijing has long been Pyongyang's most significant ally: it is North Korea's largest trade partner and source of aid. But at the same time, China is wary of Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, which could destabilise the region, and its growing ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia.",

But nobody has been appointed to chair the inquiry, leading to some families urging Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to intervene.Streeting is expected to meet some of families affected by the deaths on Monday afternoon.Ahead of the meeting on Monday, Streeting vowed to work with the families to rebuild confidence and ensure the inquiry would deliver \"the truth they deserved\".\"Losing a baby is devastating beyond words, and you deserve not just answers, but a process you can trust,\" he said. \"The strength and dignity these families have shown, while carrying unimaginable grief shows extraordinary courage. I am personally committed to ensuring this inquiry is thorough, independent, and puts families at its heart.\"Earlier this month, five MPs penned a letter, seen by the BBC, to Downing Street, stating: \"Leeds families have lost faith and confidence in the Secretary of State for Health's handling of this inquiry\".Bereaved families were concerned about the delay and the possibility of appointing a chair who used an \"untested and unrefined methodology\", the letter said.It urged Sir Keir to appoint senior midwife Donna Ockenden to chair the Leeds NHS Trust investigation. She is currently leading an inquiry into Nottingham maternity services, which is examining about 2,500 cases of failings.Ockenden has said she is \"ready to chair the review into Leeds maternity services and can begin work immediately if asked.\"A copy of the letter was hand-delivered to Downing Street  on 11 February by families affected by the deaths. Among them were Fiona Winser-Ramm and Dan Ramm, whose daughter Aliona died in January 2020 at Leeds General Infirmary. An inquest found \"a number of gross failures\" that \"directly contributed\" to her death.\"When we've met with the secretary of state, he is often saying the right things to us,\" Winser-Ramm said. \"But it isn't translating into what is proposed for the inquiry by the Department of Health.\"Related stories",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonathan GeddesBBC Scotland NewsAlice Miring'uAlice Miring'u of Kenya's national paracycling team has gratefully received the tandem bike When Dr Carrie Ruxton posted on social media asking if anyone wanted her old tandem bike, she thought there might be some local interest.But the St Andrews gym owner was taken aback when a message came in from the national paracycling team of Kenya.Suitable bikes for blind cyclists and their pilots are hard to find in the African country, and one of the cycling team had spotted Carrie's post.After months of sorting the logistics out, the bike safely arrived in Nairobi last week, where it could now feature in international competition. Stories you may have missedThe bike had originally been used by Carrie for her daughter Erin, who then outgrew it and got her own bike.Last year she uploaded a post to Facebook, putting the bike up for sale. After little interest she then said the bike was free to a good home and could be collected from Cupar in Fife.Among the expressions of interest that followed was a post from Alice Miring'u, a prominent Kenyan cyclist.She wrote: \"currently searching for tandem bike for racing am in paracycling team and have no tandem bike. It can be of great help to me.\" Carrie RuxtonCarrie Ruxton was glad to send her bike off to KenyaAlthough initially taken aback, Carrie soon decided that she would try and help, even if collecting the bike from her home was obviously no longer an option.She told BBC Scotland News: \"I had got a few replies, but I just thought what a wonderful idea.\"In Kenya they don't make tandem bikes, so they have to be donated.\"Alice cycles as a pilot for cyclists with impaired sight, and I thought it would be good to help if we could get the bike there.\"The duo were able to find a Kenyan based in Glasgow, who sent containers with items back to his homeland. He collected the bike to be included in his next shipment.Carrie added: \"With the distance you do wonder if it'll actually get there. \"But out of the blue I got a message last weekend saying it had arrived on Valentine's Day.\"The bike will now be made suitable for racing, with upgraded components, and then tested on the track later this year.Ironically, Kenya are competing at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer.But the work the bike needs means it is unlikely to be heading back to Scotland.In the meantime it has been fittingly named Valentine by its new owners.Carrie said: \"I tied a tartan ribbon around it before it was shipped away.  \"It was a wonderful feeling to see Alice smiling away with the bike next to her.\" ",

    "body": "5 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesAn armed man has been shot dead after entering the secure perimeter of US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the Secret Service has said.The man was carrying a shotgun and fuel can when he was stopped and shot by Secret Service agents and a Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.The incident happened around 01:30 ET (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning, when the president was in Washington DC. The suspect has been named as 21-year-old Austin T Martin of Cameron, North Carolina, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.His family in North Carolina had reported him missing in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Moore County Sheriff's Office said in a statement to the BBC. The missing persons information has since been turned over to federal authorities, the sheriff's office said.They added that the department had no record of prior history concerning Martin and that it was not involved in the Florida investigation.Officials are looking into whether he bought the gun along the driving route he took from North Carolina to Florida, according to CBS.US Secret Service agents fired at him after they saw him \"unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning\", agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on X on Sunday.The suspect \"was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\", the agency said in a statement.The man was then shot after refusing orders, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items', which means the gas can and the shotgun,\" Bradshaw told a news conference. \"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" he said. At that point, agents fired their weapons to \"neutralise the threat\", Bradshaw added.FacebookThe suspect had been reported missing by relatives, according to CBSThe officers were wearing body cameras and no law enforcement officers were injured, he said.Bradshaw said that he did not know whether the suspect's gun was loaded, saying that will form part of an investigation the FBI will be assisting with.US Secret Service Director Sean Curran travelled to Florida on Sunday for \"after-actions\" and had \"reinvigorated operational communication and agency response to critical incidents\", the agency said in a post on X. Security at Mar-a-Lago is extremely tight, with an outer cordon of local Palm Beach sheriffs and an inner one maintained by the Secret Service. Visitors are searched, and cars and bags are swept by dogs and metal detectors.Trump has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.In July 2024, Trump was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bystander was killed and two were injured in the shooting. The shooter, 20-year-old Matthew Crooks, was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.Months later, a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle sticking out of bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The man, later identified as Ryan Routh, fled but was caught. The 59-year-old was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for attempting to assassinate the president.During an appearance on Fox Business after the fatal incident, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the the political left for \"normalising\" political violence,  citing the two attempts on Trump's life in 2024,\"Two would-be assassins dead, one in jail for life, and this venom coming from the other side,\" Bessent said, adding: \"They are normalising this violence. It's got to stop.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here.

    "body": "9 hours agoWill GrantMexico correspondentBBC on what the killing of drug lord 'El Mencho' means for MexicoThere are only a handful of names that have had a lasting impact in the history of Mexican organised crime.Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes – more commonly known as \"El Mencho\" – is one of them. Hailing from humble rural roots in the western state of Michoacán, his rise to the top of one of the most feared and dangerous cartels in modern Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), was meteoric. And it was achieved through aggression, ambition, brutality and ruthlessness.His killing has been heralded as a victory in both Mexico and the United States.The Mexican authorities and the US reported that US intelligence was involved in bringing down the kingpin, lending the operation a sense of cross-border co-operation that could benefit both governments. For the Mexican military, a cartel leader has been removed from the equation, thereby weakens – at least in theory, and maybe for a time – the criminal group he ran.The response from El Mencho's men has been swift.Roadblocks have been erected and violence has spilt over into the streets in as many as eight different states, from Guerrero on the Pacific coast to Tamaulipas in the north-east. Even the capital, Mexico City, and the surrounding Mexico State have seen incidents.Some of the worst violence has been in Jalisco itself, with masked gunmen setting fire to stores in the state capital, Guadalajara – one of the venues for this summer's Fifa World Cup. In the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta, tourists and locals alike are sheltering in place until the wave of violence passes.It's a show of loyalty from El Mencho's foot-soldiers and a show of fury at the authorities for eliminating their leader. But whether the roadblocks and burning cars are for anything more than just show – that is, whether the violence de-escalates or ramps up – will only become clear over next few days. The reaction by law enforcement will be critical in that regard.It is a long-held truth about such transnational criminal groups that, even with a cartel head as influential as Oseguera, there are inevitably three or four well-placed lieutenants on hand to replace him.Undoubtedly, though, El Mencho was key to the group's ascendancy.When he moved to the US as an undocumented immigrant in the 1980s, he had already had his first brushes with criminality in cultivating the marijuana fields of his native state. Various arrests in the US followed as he dug deeper into narcotics crime in California, before eventually being sentenced to several years in prison in the US.ReutersCars burn in Zapopan, near Guadalajara, after El Mencho's death on SundayOseguera was deported back to Mexico aged 30 and began to fully immerse himself in cartel activity. He worked for the Milenio Cartel, based out of his native Michoacán, and grew in stature and reputation as a calculating and cruel boss.He was ideally placed when the cartel fractured and, from its remnants, the CJNG sprang up with El Mencho at its head.Through a combination of territorial expansion and the nimbleness to pivot the cartel's activity into new and lucrative illegal activities, he turned the group into what it has become today – arguably the predominant criminal force in Mexico.His leadership and his cartel benefitted from the collapse of the Sinaloa Cartel after the extradition of its leader, Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, to the US. Subsequent battles between warring factions in Sinaloa have ultimately torn the group apart.The New Generation Cartel was on hand to hoover up an important portion of the fentanyl trade after the fall of El Chapo's sons. One of them, Joaquín Guzmán López, handed himself in to the US authorities and brought down his group's biggest rival, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, with him.El Mencho was a clear beneficiary of the vacuum and the dramatic sequence of events in Sinaloa. But, as is so often the case in Mexican drug crime, it was not a crown he wore for long.The government of Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum will portray the removal of one of the country's most wanted men as a victory and this will be echoed in Washington. It shows progress on the main issue from which US President Donald Trump has demanded action from Mexico after immigration: fentanyl trafficking.Given the element of US intelligence apparently involved, it also underlines the Sheinbaum administration's willingness to work together with Washington in pursuit of the same goals. She would hope it will be enough to stave off any further talk of the need for unilateral US military action on Mexican soil in the form of drone strikes or boots on the ground – something which some in the Republican Party and in the Trump administration have openly called for.Such discussions are still to come. For the time being, Mexicans are still processing that El Mencho is dead, and in his absence watching cartel members set fires in the streets in cities across the nation.",

    "body": "Sutton's predictions v Tailenders host Felix WhiteAston Villa are going for a fourth successive Premier League victory when they travel to Brighton on Wednesday, but should Unai Emery's side change the way they have been scoring goals on their winning run?\"There is apparently some debate about whether Villa's xG (expected goals) is unsustainable because they are scoring from long range, but that's nonsense,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\"Villa have good players who can shoot from the edge of the box, so are you seriously going to tell them not to shoot now, because of xG? Give me a break.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For the midweek fixtures in week 14, he takes on musician, author and Fulham fan Felix White.White is the guitarist with The Maccabees and 86TVs. His new book 'Whatever will be, will be: A Matter of Life and Football' is out now.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image caption, White co-presents the BBC cricket podcast, Tailenders, and the official Fulham podcast, Fulham FixWhite's book follows his journey through the 2024-25 FA Cup campaign from the extra-preliminary round to the final at Wembley.\"It started accidentally when I was on tour with 86TVs, at Kendal Calling in the Lake District,\" White told BBC Sport. \"I was having a weird day and, probably like many people reading this, when I am feeling like that I quite often go and find football or cricket. I find watching it just airbrushes me, and just changes my way of thinking about the world.\"I saw Penrith were playing down the road and we weren't on stage until after 6pm, so I worked out I'd just have enough time to get back afterwards. I watched the game in their ground surrounded by hills, and it gave me a sensation almost like I was watching football for the very first time.\"Anyway, I realised at the end that I couldn't get a taxi back to the festival so I had a bit of a panic, and I ended up getting a lift with a guy called Billy Williams, who turned out to be the chairman of Penrith.\"When I was in the car with him, all these stories came flooding out and it made me think that from a literary perspective, the FA Cup is quite a profound kind of framework.\"Because of what it means to people, I realised this was an adventure where I could write a book telling a story not just about English football, but about England itself.\"Chris Sutton and Felix White were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.Tuesday, 2 DecemberVitality Stadium, 19:30 GMTThis is a difficult one to start off with. Both teams suffered bad defeats at the weekend for different reasons.Bournemouth let a two-goal lead slip as they went down 3-2 at Sunderland and have now lost three of their past four games.At 2-2, Evanilson had a goal disallowed for offside when he tapped in a deflected cross which looked like it was heading in anyway. I was trying to think back to whether I'd have done the same thing as a striker and, yes, I would. Single-mindedness is what I'd call it.Everton have surely got to defend better than they did in their 4-1 defeat by Newcastle. I just didn't expect to see them capitulate like that.Bournemouth have started leaking a few goals recently too, so maybe there is some hope for one of Everton's less-than-prolific strikers to finally find the net - but I actually think this will be quite tight and the Cherries will edge it.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: These two sides are going to level out and end up quite close to each other in the table by the end of the season, in eighth or ninth or something like that. I feel like they will closely matched on Tuesday, too. 1-1AI's prediction: 2-1Craven Cottage, 19:30I am at this game for 5 Live. We had my predictions opponent Felix on the FPL Podcast last week and I know he will go for a Fulham win here - I really like him, and I enjoy listening to Tailenders, but I'm sorry to say he's going to get this prediction wrong.Fulham's home form this season probably gives Felix some hope but their record against City is absolutely awful.City have won their past 18 meetings in all competitions since 2012, which is the longest winning run by a team against any opponent in the entire history of English football, scoring 54 goals and conceding only seven.I covered City against Leeds on Saturday and they got lucky, while away from home they have lost three times already. With the run they are on against Fulham, however, there is no way they won't win this game.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Felix's prediction: This is the only game I am going to call totally from my heart and not my head. We have beaten a lot of big teams recently, but we haven't beaten City for a long time, especially at the Cottage. That changes here, and in exactly the same way that we beat Liverpool in April. So, City are going to go 1-0 up then we will score three. They will nick one back and then there will be 10 minutes of manic defending, but we will hold on. 3-2Felix on Fulham: It's been such a weird season because the table is so tight at the moment that one bad result makes everyone worry about relegation, and a couple of good ones, like we've just had, makes you think 'oh we're only five points from being fifth'.AI's prediction: 1-3St James' Park, 20:15Tottenham boss Thomas Frank needs a result. He was so relaxed when he was at Brentford but now he just looks like a guy under pressure.Frank saying the supporters who booed Guglielmo Vicario after his mistake against Fulham \"can't be true Tottenham fans\" underlines the friction he is feeling at the moment, but he does have a point about the effect that has.As a player who has been booed a lot over the years, I can tell you that it doesn't have a positive impact on your performance. Being serious, though, I just don't get it - it just creates negativity.The Spurs players will probably be relieved to be playing away after that, but Newcastle have found a bit of form in the past week so this is not an easy trip at all.Tottenham have already lost at St James' Park this season in the Carabao Cup, and I am going for a repeat result, by the same scoreline.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Felix's prediction: It feels like Newcastle are just starting to go through the gears. In contrast, with the amount of games Spurs have got and the form they are in, they are going to be struggling. 3-0AI's prediction: 2-0Wednesday, 3 DecemberEmirates Stadium, 19:30Chelsea were down to 10 men for an hour on Sunday so I was a little bit surprised Arsenal did not go for it more.There has been legitimate criticism of Gunners boss Mikel Arteta in the past about him being too negative, and I don't think they went for the jugular at Stamford Bridge.If it was 11 versus 11 then a 1-1 draw there is not a bad result at all, because Chelsea are a good team, but are Arsenal making the most of these opportunities? I am not sure.Still, I think they will bounce back and beat Brentford, and I can see them getting a few goals this time.We know the Bees will sit in and try to hit them on the counter with balls in behind for Igor Thiago, but I don't think it will work.Sutton's prediction: 3-0Felix's prediction: Arsenal are going to win this, aren't they? They just look so professional and so solid. They are going to be absolutely cruising in the title race until February or March and then if Manchester City or Chelsea, or whoever it is, are within five or six points then they might feel the pressure. I can see them losing a game or two then, but only if anyone is still close to them. For now, though, I don't see anyone beating them. 2-0AI's prediction: 2-0Amex Stadium, 19:30Villa are playing well right now but this is a tough trip for them and with their heavy schedule it might be a game too far. Brighton are in great form too, especially at home. Their boss Fabian Hurzeler has done a great job there.The Seagulls have got plenty of firepower and a strong squad so, on that basis, I am going to back them.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: Brighton are in really good form. Villa are too, but I think the games might catch up with them here. 2-1AI's prediction: 1-2Turf Moor, 19:30Manchester United did not have to play particularly well to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, and Eagles boss Oliver Glasner moaned afterwards about the club's failure to bring players in over the summer.When a manager does that, I start to wonder how long he will hang around. I get it - you have to leave when your stock is high, and Glasner's certainly is at the moment.He is right, though, because their squad is stretched. Glasner must have been listening to the Monday Night Club because I've been saying the same thing since the start of the season, about how they are going to come a cropper because it is very difficult to compete without that depth.I still think Palace will win this game though, because Burnley are in a bit of bother.Scott Parker's side don't score enough goals so it was real blow for them to get level at Brentford with five minutes to go on Saturday and still get nothing from the game.I have a feeling they will battle away here too, and then see Palace sneak it late on.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Felix's prediction: Palace also have played loads of games and I had a feeling they would struggle against Manchester United before they lost on Sunday. I still think they will win this one though. It feels like Burnley ship goals at the end of games, because they don't quite last the pace. 1-3Felix on being at Wembley when Palace won last season's FA Cup: I had so many mad journeys and adventures in the book, and it almost became about finding the game that had the story behind it that had nothing to do with football, but was about the people I met or even me personally. But I do have to say that being among the Palace fans at Wembley was honestly the closest thing I've seen to an actual religious experience. The sense that they were doing something by winning their first major trophy that their parents or grandparents who supported Palace couldn't see, was incredible. It captured the very essence of the book because I was looking for the magic of the FA Cup and I found it right there. Even talking about it now, I still get shivers.AI's prediction: 1-1Molineux, 19:30Wolves actually played all right against Aston Villa on Sunday but they still lost again.There are six months of the season left to play but, let's face it, they've had it. They still only have two points from their first 13 games, and there is no way Rob Edwards can rescue them from here. They could bring in Pep Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - three of the great Premier League managers - and they still wouldn't keep them up.Wolves do have something to play for, though. I didn't think any team could be as bad as Robbie Savage's Derby County side that went down with a record Premier League low of 11 points in 2007-08, so beating that total is maybe their only aim now.Nottingham Forest's defeat by Brighton on Sunday was a bit of a sickener for Sean Dyche, because he had made such a good start there. His team should be too streetwise for Wolves, though.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Felix's prediction: It's hard to see Wolves winning a game at the moment. 1-2AI's prediction: 2-1Elland Road, 20:15Leeds lumped it in the second half against Manchester City and it almost got them a point. They were lucky to still be in the game at half-time but fair play to Daniel Farke for making the substitutes and changing the system, because he has been accused of not being proactive enough during games.As lively as Leeds were, they still ended up empty-handed, however, and it means they really need something here. You know they will give it a go but, again, it is going to be hard for them to get anything out of a Chelsea side who are in really good form.There might be a bit of an edge to this one, because going back to my time as a Chelsea player there was always a rivalry here. I don't think it will be as rough and tumble as it was when these teams met in the 1970 FA Cup final, but I'm going for the same outcome, which is a Chelsea win.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Felix's prediction: I am going to call a mad one here for the sake of it. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-2Anfield, 20:15I got Liverpool wrong at the weekend because I thought they would lose at West Ham.Instead of Mo Salah, it was a case of 'No Salah' after he was left out for their 2-0 win. I didn't mind seeing that, because Salah is no different from any other player - if he is not performing, you drop him.I was wrong about Sunderland too, but that won't surprise anyone. We are at the stage where I am thinking should I do Black Cats fans a favour by tipping them to lose again here, because we know what happens when I do that - they win.I actually think they will give a good account of themselves at Anfield and it would not surprise me at all to see them going there and winning - I really mean that, too, because we've all seen how capable Regis le Bris' side are.I am still going to go with Liverpool though. I don't think they can be as bad as they were in their last two home games, against Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Felix's prediction: When Sunderland came to Craven Cottage last week they let us have a lot of the ball. It was like they were thinking they could sting us on the counter-attack but they almost looked like they were going to get found out. We had 20-odd chances, so I can't believe Liverpool won't do the same. 2-0AI's prediction: 3-1Thursday, 4 DecemberOld Trafford, 20:00Manchester United fought back to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday but they didn't really deserve it.They are still a basket case of a club, and you could say the same about West Ham.How can I predict what Ruben Amorim's side will do? No-one can. I can't get my head around them.There is no reason to back them here, or West Ham either. The Hammers pushed Liverpool close on Sunday, but they did not really threaten very much despite the Reds being so vulnerable defensively at the moment.There definitely won't be many goals in this game, but I already know I am going to be wrong about it.In fact, I wish I didn't have to make a prediction here, but I've been told I have to.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Felix's prediction: I am going to say Nuno Espirito Santo gets a point. 0-0AI's prediction: 2-2How did Sutton do last time?There was a three-way tie for victory at the weekend, but Chris was not involved.He got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 13, for a total of 30 points.Instead, the win was shared between the BBC readers, AI and Chris' guest - rapper Kofi Stone.They all got four correct results, with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.",

    "body": "When F1 title has gone to a final-race three-way fightByAlan JewellBBC Sport The 2025 Formula 1 drivers' championship has come down to a three-way fight going into the final race of the season, with Lando Norris, Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri all in contention.Briton Norris leads Red Bull's Verstappen, who is seeking a fifth consecutive title, by 12 points with Piastri a further four points back.McLaren drivers Norris and Piastri are both aiming for their first F1 title.It is not often that three drivers go into the final race with a chance of winning the championship. BBC Sport looks back at some previous occasions when it's happened...Farina pips Fangio and Fagioli - 1950Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Giuseppe Farina (right) just beat Juan Manuel Fangio to the first Formula 1 World ChampionshipThe first Formula 1 World Championship went down to the final race, in Italy at Monza, with Alfa Romeo's Juan Manuel Fangio, Giuseppe Farina and Luigi Fagioli all in contention.Going into the grand prix, Argentine Fangio led Italian Fagioli by two points and Farina, another Italian, by four. Mechanical problems ended Fangio's afternoon and Farina came through to win the race and secure the inaugural drivers' championship, with Fagioli in third in the race and the overall standings.Fangio would go on to win five titles between 1951 and 1957 and is considered one of F1's all-time greats.   Brabham pushes to the limit - 1959Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An exhausted Jack Brabham takes a drink after pushing his Cooper over the line to win the 1959 titleAustralian Jack Brabham led the championship before the season-ending 1959 United States Grand Prix in Sebring, Florida, with Britons Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks still in contention.Moss, who was in second, needed to win or finish second with fellow Cooper driver Brabham behind him, while Ferrari's Brooks had to win to have any chance, and even then could still be beaten to the title.Moss led from pole position but retired with a broken gearbox early on, handing the initiative to Brabham, who had been tracking his rival a short distance behind.Brabham led almost to the finish, before running out of fuel on the last lap. Brooks passed him for third but Brabham pushed his Cooper across the line to take fourth place and the first of his three world titles. It was also the first achieved in a rear-engined F1 car.Battle of the Britons - 1964Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, John Surtees, pictured at the Mexican Grand Prix where he won the F1 drivers' championship, took the 500cc motorbike titles in 1956 and again from 1958-60John Surtees became the only man to win world titles on two wheels and four with his F1 championship in 1964.Surtees trailed fellow Englishman Graham Hill by five points before the decider in Mexico, while Scot Jim Clark was in third, a further four points behind.BRM's Hill, the 1962 champion, was delayed by a collision with Surtees' Ferrari team-mate Lorenzo Bandini. Clark, driving a Lotus, was then on course to win after dominating from the front, but was forced to stop on the last lap with an oil leak.Seeing Clark's problems, Ferrari ordered Bandini to let Surtees by into second place, which gave him the title by one point from Hill.Piquet takes title in a parking lot - 1981Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The start of the 1981 Caesars Palace Grand Prix, with Williams' Alan Jones leading into the first cornerThe Las Vegas Grand Prix, focused on the Strip, has been generally considered a big success since it was established on the F1 calendar in 2023, but it is not quite the first iteration of the event.In 1981 and 1982, a Caesars Palace Grand Prix was staged on a track built in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel.Neither the venue nor the circuit are fondly remembered, though it hosted championship deciders in both years.In 1981, Williams' Carlos Reutemann had a one-point lead over Brabham's Nelson Piquet with Ligier's Jacques Laffite also still in contention. Frenchman Lafitte needed to finish first or second to have a chance, at a time when only the top six drivers scored points, but Argentine Reutemann looked well set when he qualified on pole.However, he dropped back throughout the race, eventually finishing eighth, and was lapped by race winner and team-mate Alan Jones.Brazilian Piquet struggled with heat exhaustion in the final stages but was able to come home fifth, giving him the two points he needed to overtake Reutemann, with Laffite in sixth.'And colossally that's Mansell' - 1986Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nigel Mansell finished second in the 1986, 1987 and 1991 drivers' championships, before eventually winning it in 1992The day when Nigel Mansell's dreams, as well as his left rear tyre, shattered.The Briton went into the 1986 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide knowing that a third-place finish would ensure he won the drivers' championship.With nine points on offer for a race win, McLaren's Alain Prost, the 1985 champion, was six behind with Mansell's Williams colleague Nelson Piquet seven back. 'Team-mate' does not seem appropriate here, given their fractious relationship.Mansell was secure in that third place, behind Piquet and Prost, with 19 laps to go when his tyre exploded down the 200mph Brabham Straight. BBC commentator Murray Walker memorably exclaimed: \"And look at that! And colossally that's Mansell!\"Williams called Piquet in to change his tyres as a precaution against the same thing happening - McLaren's Keke Rosberg had retired from the lead with a puncture shortly before Mansell's drama.That left Frenchman Prost to bring his McLaren home first and secure back-to-back championships, while Mansell had to wait until 1992 before finally winning the title.Hamilton's near miss in rookie year - 2007Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kimi Raikkonen came from 17 points behind with two races to go to win the 2007 titleArguably, this should have been Lewis Hamilton's world title in his stunning rookie season but it all went wrong for the Briton in the final two races.After winning the Japanese Grand Prix in extreme wet conditions, the 22-year-old led McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso by 12 points with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen 17 behind. This was when drivers received 10 points for a race win.In China, Hamilton slid off into a gravel trap on worn tyres, while in the finale in Brazil, a poor start followed by a problem with a hydraulic valve, which caused him to be stuck in fourth gear for 25 seconds, left him at the back of the field.Although he fought back to seventh, which brought him two points, he needed to finish fifth to be certain of the championship.Finn Raikkonen took the title by winning the last two races, with Alonso - whose relationship with McLaren had broken down completely during a tumultuous season - only managing third in the race and the championship.Vettel top standings when it matters most - 2010Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sebastian Vettel won four consecutive drivers' championships between 2010 and 2013This was actually a four-way fight in Abu Dhabi, although Lewis Hamilton only had the faintest of chances, being 24 points behind leader Fernando Alonso heading into the final race with two other drivers between them in the standings.Spaniard Alonso, in his first season at Ferrari, had an eight-point advantage over Red Bull's Mark Webber, with Sebastian Vettel in third, 15 points back.Although German Vettel won from pole, the title should still have been Alonso's.However, a strategic error from Ferrari in bringing Alonso in for an early pit stop, to cover off Webber, left him stuck behind Renault's Vitaly Petrov for the remainder of the race. His seventh-place finish, with Webber in eighth, allowed Vettel to pip both of them.It was the first time the Red Bull driver had led the championship all year. And Max Verstappen is now aiming to replicate that feat in Abu Dhabi this Sunday...

    "body": "3 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterCar-sharing platform Zipcar has said it is to close its UK operations by the end of the year.The US-based company, which is owned by car rental giant Avis Budget, told customers it would temporarily suspend new bookings after 31 December, pending the outcome of a consultation with its 71 staff members.In an email to members, UK boss James Taylor said the firm had launched a formal consultation with employees and bookings due to finish by the end of the month were being honoured.An Avis Budget spokesperson confirmed that it was planning to close Zipcar UK, but said \"all other markets remain unaffected\".Zipcar members would still be able to use the fleet over Christmas and until 31 December, it said.The company has about 650,000 members in the UK who rent cars by the hour or day from an app and collect the vehicles from parking spaces, making it the UK's largest car-sharing operator.An Avis Budget spokesperson said the decision to cease trading in the UK from 2026 was part of a plan \"to streamline operations, improve returns, and position the company for long-term sustainability and growth\".Zipcar closed its operations in Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol last year to focus on its core London market, where it has more than 550,000 members.In its most recent company accounts for 2024, Zipcar blamed the \"cost of living crisis\", which was affecting UK customers, for revenues falling to £47m from £53m the year before, while its after-tax losses had widened to £11.6m.According to the same accounts, Zipcar membership fees cover the cost of fuelling or charging the vehicle and, as energy costs continued to rise last year, it has added to financial pressures on the company.The company would also be liable for the incoming congestion charge in London that is expanding to include electric vehicles from 26 December, although this was not referenced in Zipcar's email to membership or company accounts.",

    "body": "9 minutes agoThe Financial Times leads with the news of the Office for Budget Responsibility chair's resignation after its early Budget leak. Richard Hughes's departure follows a review that found \"the same failures had allowed early access to the Spring Statement\" and left concerns that \"other Budgets could also have been compromised\".For The Daily Telegraph, it is \"Reeves clings on as OBR chief silenced\". Richard Hughes will not now appear in front of a Treasury committee after his resignation, \"sparing Ms Reeves further criticism when she is already under pressure to resign\". In further Budget news, council houses worth more than £2m will not face the new property tax introduced by the Chancellor, it reports.The i Paper also runs the exit of the OBR chair in its top slot, though says he was \"forced out after contradicting Chancellor\". Relations between the financial watchdog and the Treasury were at an \"all-time low\" after Richard Hughes chose to publish a timeline it says challenged Reeves's claims about \"difficulties she faced balancing the books\".The headline in the Times says the the OBR chair stepping down came after he was \"publicly rebuked\" by the prime minister. A review of the Budget's early release found it was the \"worst failure\" in the office's history. Singer Kylie Minogue is splashed across the front wearing Jonathan Anderson to the Fashion Awards, where the designer won the top award. The Guardian says Richard Hughes took \"full responsibility\" for the Budget leak as he exited the OBR, while Sir Keir Starmer \"notably failed to express confidence in the senior economist\". Labour MP Tulip Siddiq also is picture on the front page after being been sentenced to two years of jail in Bangladesh after being put on trial in her absence over corruption allegations. She said the process had been \"flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end\".The Daily Mail calls Ex-OBR chair Richard Hughes \"the fall guy for Reeves' Budget lies\", saying the government has \"no shame\". It writes that Hughes \"exposed the truth about her financial 'black hole',\" referring to the funding gap she had indicated she needed to fill.The Independent also leads on the \"Budget black hole\" but with a denial from Sir Keir Starmer that \"we didn't mislead anyone\" over it. Now, the \"Labour briefings row\" - over what Rachel Reeves and Sir Keir discussed with ministers about the improved OBR forecast - \"deepens\", says the Indy.The Daily Express focuses on a speech the prime minister gave on Monday where he referenced the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. Sir Keir Starmer made \"vows to appease Brussels as he scrambled to defend his under-fire Chancellor\" it says.The Daily Mirror calls for \"justice for the lost victims\" of the Post Office Horizon scandal. Police could now bring corporate manslaughter charges in cases where staff took their own lives after being accused of theft due to a faulty IT system, the Mirror reports.The Sun says a former England and Premier League football player has been arrested over an allegation of attempted rape. The paper says the man, who it reports played for England in the 2010s, has been bailed pending further inquiries after being arrested at Stansted airport following an allegation from an ex-partner.There are \"tears for cheers\" for \"humble hero\" Kevin Sinfield, writes the Daily Star. The former Rugby league player - currently on an ultramarathon challenge - has raised more than £10m for motor neurone disease, the paper says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud.  Bureau of Prisons records show that Gentile was released on Wednesday, less than two weeks after he reported to prison. Gentile, the former chief executive and founder of GPB Capital, was convicted last year in what federal prosecutors described as a multi-year scheme to defraud more than 10,000 investors by misrepresenting the performance of private equity funds.He's the latest in a string of white-collar criminals whose sentences Trump has commuted.Gentile was convicted in August last year of securities and wire fraud charges, and sentenced in May. His co-defendant, Jeffry Schneider, was sentenced to six years on the same charges and is due to report to prison in January.US attorney Joseph Nocella said at the time of Gentile's sentencing that GPB Capital was built on a \"foundation of lies\" and that the company made $1.6bn (£1.2bn) while using investor capital to pay distributions to other investors. \"The sentences imposed today are well deserved and should serve as a warning to would-be fraudsters that seeking [sic] to get rich by taking advantage of investors gets you only a one-way ticket to jail,\" he said. But the White House says the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden made multiple missteps - and that investors were aware that their money could be going towards other people's dividends.\"Even though this was disclosed to investors the Biden Department of Justice claimed this was a Ponzi scheme,\" the White House official said.\"This claim was profoundly undercut by the fact that GPB had explicitly told investors what would happen.\"The official also cited concerns from Gentile that prosecutors had elicited false testimony.Trump's commutation of Gentile's sentence does not clear him of his crimes like a full presidential pardon would, and it does not get rid of other potential penalties imposed. So far in his second term, the president has pardoned or commuted the sentences of multiple people convicted of different types of fraud, including wire, securities, tax and healthcare fraud. Last month, he pardoned Tennessee state House Speaker Glen Casada who was convicted of fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges.Correction 1 December 2025: This article incorrectly stated that Jeffry Schneider \"remains behind bars\". It has been amended to make clear that he is yet to begin serving his prison sentence.",

    "body": "9 hours agoEsyllt CarrBusiness reporterPolice officers investigating the Post Office Horizon IT scandal are now considering corporate manslaughter charges.In an update, shared with victims in the past few days, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said the investigation was currently focused on eight suspects, with five interviews conducted under caution.It said there were now 53 persons of interest, most of whom were likely to be raised to suspect status at a later stage in the probe.The NPCC said the investigation remains focussed on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice, but it was also considering charges of corporate manslaughter. Companies, rather than individuals, face such charges.The Horizon IT system, which began operating in 1999, falsely created shortfalls in Post Office branches for which sub-postmasters were held liable.The scandal has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice.More than 900 people were prosecuted and some went to prison. Some died while waiting for justice.The criminal investigation into the scandal, Operation Olympos, began in 2020. A year ago, a team of about 100 officers was launched in four regional hubs, scaling up its activity after the end of the public phase of the inquiry into the scandal.Officers are now appealing to any former sub-postmasters who may have signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the Post Office to come forward, after it was confirmed that the NDAs would no longer be enforced.The NPCC said: \"The primary and sole focus remains the offences of Perverting the Course of Justice and Perjury and this has not changed.\"However, as was done with fraud offences previously, advice is being sought from the CPS around the offences of Corporate and Gross Negligent manslaughter.\"The chair of the public inquiry, Sir Wyn Williams, published the first part of his final report on 8 July and the second volume is expected next year.The police officer leading the investigation previously told the BBC that any criminal trials may not take place before 2028.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorThe shock resignation came for a very specific reason, but the OBR saga will continue with a series of decisions the chancellor will have to make over Richard Hughes' replacement.Firstly the Chancellor will have to find a respected and credible economist to run the OBR. There are several candidates, who might fit the mould of fiercely independent bean counters.The list will be carefully watched by the markets for any departure from the normal model. The problem is that there is some political pressure to do just that. One of the points of tension was the refusal of Richard Hughes to give credit to the Government for \"pro growth\" policies. Mr Hughes had said he would not score any policy unless it was material in its impact on the economy. In the event, none reached the 0.1% of national income threshold.It is a careful balancing act, however. Any perceived interference with the OBRs independence could impact market credibility too, and, for example raise UK government borrowing costs.When I saw the now-departing chairman on the evening of the Budget last week, he was clearly mortified by the responsibility of his organisation for the early release of Budget information. While it is no surprise to me that Mr Hughes took the honourable decision to resign for an error identified as the fault of a junior member of staff, it was not the only issue vexing him.He was a fierce defender of the independence of his organisation from political and ministerial pressure - from right and left. That was seen during the Liz Truss mini budget episode, and in recent weeks too.There had been a drumbeat of noise from the right, and the left and now from the centre too about the restrictions the OBR system placed on the freedoms of elected Governments.The OBR was in some corners seen as an arm of a \"woke deep state\", and by others as an \"agent of austerity\".There had, however, been tension over the Budget. Changes had already been planned. The Chancellor had also announced that it would only respond to the OBR's forecasts once a year.Mr Hughes told me: \"We'll still be producing two full economic and fiscal forecasts looking five years out, twice a year, now and in the spring. \"But with this change of legislation, the government doesn't feel obliged to respond to those forecasts with policy in the spring.  It'll be more like a health check on the economy and the public finances.\"There'll be no loss of transparency from the forecast documentation that we'll produce.\"The precise design of the new approach to the OBR's forecast will matter. If there is a marked improvement in the public finances in spring, will the chancellor really avoid spending any \"surplus\" ahead of crucial local elections?The OBR did around the Budget score an improvement to the UK economy as a deployment of AI by the end of the decade. The OBR also used new powers to initiate a tricky costing for the ballooning cost of special educational needs in England, inviting a backlash from some Cabinet ministers. For some this underscores its ability like no campaign or Cabinet minister initiative, to focus Government priorities. Hughes denied the 35-member forecasting group was too powerful.\"The powers given to us are those given to us by Parliament in an Act of Parliament, and that's to produce a forecast. Chancellors set their own targets. They set their own policies. Chancellors are in charge of £1.5 trillion worth of revenue and £1.5 trillion worth of spending. \"If they don't want to meet their targets, they can change them, which we've seen chancellors do in the past as well. All we do is produce a baseline forecast, cost government policies when they give them to us, and we give them an assessment about whether we're up there, in line and on track to meet those targets,\" he told me.In terms of the Government's difficulties over the run up to this Budget, Mr Hughes may also take some important details of the timing of various claims around the state of the public finances to his gardening leave. He had been due to address the Treasury Select Committee this morning, that has now been cancelled. He recognised the publication of his clarification table on Friday of the evolution of the forecasts was unusual.Over five years at the OBR Richard Hughes faced five chancellors, and his relationship with all of them was designed to help promote UK economic stability. The new relationship with a different OBR is an opportunity for the Government, but a big risk too.",

    "body": "Weather warnings issued as heavy rain hits the UK with flooding expectedImage source, PA MediaImage caption, Monday morning brought wet weather to much of the UK, including Portsmouth on the south coast of EnglandBySimon King Lead weather presenterHeavy rain has hit parts of the UK on Monday, providing a wet start to meteorological winter. An amber Met Office severe weather warning for rain is in force across south Wales, while multiple yellow warnings are in force for western areas of the UK.Nearly a month's worth of rain could fall onto already very saturated ground after above average rainfall throughout November across England and Wales.There were also some gusty winds, especially around coastal areas.Numerous yellow Met Office warnings are in force as parts of the country experience cloud, rain and strong winds.A more severe amber Met Office warning for south Wales came to an end at 21:00 GMT.Between 20 and 40mm (0.8 and 1.6in) of rain is expected to fall widely here, with some south-western facing hills seeing nearer to 120mm (4.7in).The average rainfall for south Wales and south-west England for the whole of December is 152mm (6in).Extensive flooding is possible along with disruption on the road and rail network, loss of power and communities potentially cut off. The Met Office has also warned that fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life.Image caption, Numerous Met Office weather warnings in force across the UK including a more severe amber warning in South WalesImage source, GettyImage caption, Parts of the UK saw heavy rain on MondayAdditionally, yellow Met Office weather warnings are in force for north-west England, south-west Scotland, parts of the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humber until 23:59 on Monday.In the 24 hours to18:00 on Monday evening, Cwm Dyli in Gwynedd, Wales, had seen the highest rainfall at 120mm (4.7in).Nearby Afon Colywan has seen 98.2mm (3.9in) and Tyn Y Waun Treherbert in Bridgend, Wales, registered rainfall of 87.8mm (3.5in) in the same period.Poor weather has affected some train services, including on the ScotRail route between Glasgow Central and Kilmarnock and Carlisle, where disruption is expected until 09:00 on Tuesday.In Wales, rail replacement buses are running after train services were suspended on the Conwy Valley and Heart of Wales line, including between Llandudno and Blaenau Ffestiniog, and Swansea and Shrewsbury.Image source, Edna Clouds/Weather WatchersImage caption, Parts of Wales have seen rising floodwatersFlood warnings have been issued by the Environment Agency (EA) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW).An EA spokesperson said: \"We urge people not to drive though flood water – it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm (1ft) of flowing water is enough to float your car.\"Strong winds will also accompany the heavy rain, with gales possible around coasts and over high ground.Record wet NovemberNovember has been very wet overall, especially across England and Wales.Data released from the Met Office Hadley Centre shows that it has been the wettest month of 2025 so far, recording rainfall that was 31% above average.In parts of eastern England, some weather stations have recorded their highest November rainfall on record.Bridlington, Yorkshire for example has had nearly three times the normal rainfall with 180mm recorded compared to an average of 66mm - a new record for November.Other parts of East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have received more than double their normal rainfall with the wettest November on record.Autumn has been the only season this year to record above-average rainfall. The UK as a whole saw 20% more than the long-term meteorological average, with Northern Ireland and Wales seeing significantly more.Autumn has continued the run of above-average temperatures in 2025. But with a mean temperature of 0.4C above seasonal average, no records have been broken.Looking aheadTonight, with the exception of northern Scotland, the rain will move away and winds will ease, leaving clear spells and showers. Tuesday and Wednesday will bring drier, brighter and less windy weather with sunny spells and scattered showers. Most of these showers will be in the south and west, where there may also be localised thunder. Further rain is expected later in the week.",

    "body": "President Zelensky has said Kyiv's priorities in peace talks to end the war with Russia are maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and securing strong security guarantees.Zelensky said \"the territorial issue is the most difficult\", as Russia continues to demand that Ukraine give up areas of the eastern Donbas region that it still holds – which Kyiv maintains it will never do.He was speaking after meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where he joined a call with European leaders including those of the UK, Germany, Poland, and Italy.Meanwhile, Ukrainian and US negotiators finished two days of meetings in Florida as they worked to revise a peace plan viewed as favouring Russia.The White House struck a positive tone on the talks on Monday, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the administration \"feels very optimistic\" about a deal being reached to end the war.Zelensky was more circumspect, posting on X that the talks were \"very constructive\" but there are \"some tough issues that still have to be worked through\".US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who attended the talks with the Ukrainian delegation, is now bound for Russia where he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. They will be joined by President Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.Witkoff has spoken with Zelensky, Macron, Ukrainian chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and is expected to relay the result of the discussions to Putin.Last week Putin said a draft peace plan had been shown by the Americans to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.The initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe. As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billions' worth of frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested and dictated the terms of Kyiv's access to EU markets.But Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\". He also insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.European leaders have scrambled to get a seat at the negotiating table since the peace plan was leaked, and have urged the US to involve them in drafting any future agreement.Macron said that the territorial question could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\" and pointed out that issues of frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.But the French leader also praised efforts by Donald Trump's administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and was followed by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\"Now we are waiting the Russian answer: are they ready to stop fighting and make peace? I want to point out that for three, four times the Russians have said no,\" he added. \"So they don't seem in a rush.\"Throughout the year Moscow has appeared to engage with US attempts to end the war or discuss a ceasefire, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv. While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again. But Russia vehemently opposes this and Donald Trump too has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.Away from the negotiating table, the war continues.On Monday morning a Russian missile attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro killed four people and injured 40, authorities have said. Unconfirmed reports say a ballistic missile was used in the strike.Videos shared online showed a large explosion occur on the side of a motorway, and local media said an office block, cars and shops were hit or badly damaged.\"We are trying to end this war with all our might and to end this war in a dignified manner,\" Zelensky said in Paris. \"Russia must end this war that it started, it is its war and it is up to it to put an end to it.\"The latest diplomatic push comes as Zelensky is mired in a serious corruption scandal. His chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had also led the Ukrainian delegation at peace talks, resigned on Friday after anti-corruption investigators raided his home - although he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Two cabinet ministers have also been fired.On Sunday Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Ukraine had \"some difficult little problems\", referring to the scandal, and repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war.

    "body": "A teenage girl has died and a second has been seriously injured in a crash involving a minibus and a car in North Yorkshire, police have said. Emergency services were called to Toulston Lane, near Tadcaster Grammar School, at about 12:30 GMT after reports a white Mercedes Sprinter minibus had collided with a Hyundai i10.The force said the bus had been carrying nine passengers, aged 16 to 18, as well as the driver at the time of the crash.North Yorkshire Police said the driver of the Hyundai, a 40-year-old woman, had been arrested in connection with the investigation.The other passengers and the man driving the minibus received treatment at hospital for minor injuries, the force added. The minibus had been travelling towards Sherburn when the light-coloured Hyundai entered Toulston Lane from Rudgate, a spokesperson said.Toulston Lane is closed to traffic while police inquiries continue.Roads closed after two-vehicle crash near schoolIn a message sent to parents, Tadcaster Grammar School said it would be shut on Tuesday as the site \"will not be safe for students\".Posting on social media, Sir Alec Sherbrook, MP for Wetherby & Easingwold, called the news \"desperately sad\".\"The thoughts of prayers of our community are with the families of those affected,\" he added. Speaking from the scene earlier BBC Look North reporter Olivia Richwald said there was a large cordon in place covering three roads close to Tadcaster Grammar School.She said: \"We've seen two vehicles behind that cordon - one a small pale-coloured car with what looks like a dented front bumper.\"The second is larger, perhaps a van or a small bus. It is behind a tarpaulin.\"Police remain guarding the scene tonight.\"She added: \"The road is quiet and it's not a residential area so there isn't anyone around, except the odd car which is driving up to the road closure signs and turning around.\" Anyone who witnessed the collision or has relevant footage of what happened is asked to contact police.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentKing Charles and Queen Camilla will host the first German state visit to the UK in 27 years - with a state banquet and ceremonial events in Windsor on Wednesday.Such state visits are about projecting soft power and building relationships, and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier's three-day visit will see a mix of pageantry, politics and culture.Events for the president will range from speaking in Parliament and meeting German Premier League footballers to visiting the David Bowie Centre in the Victoria and Albert Museum's new wing in east London.In a message of reconciliation, there will be a visit to the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, bombed during the Second World War.This mirrors a visit to Hamburg during the UK state visit to Germany in 2023, when King Charles laid a wreath remembering the civilian casualties of wartime Allied bombing raids.The state visit by President Steinmeier and his wife Elke Budenbender, will begin on Wednesday with the traditional formal welcomes and military parades.There will be a carriage ride on the way to Windsor Castle - which didn't take place during the recent US state visit by President Trump, who moved in and out by helicopter, reducing security risks but also any opportunity for protests.A highlight of such visits is the spectacular state banquet in St George's Hall, where the King and president will make speeches, with celebrity guests enjoying a showcase dinner.When in Germany, the King had spoken about the importance of supporting Ukraine, so there will be interest in whether he might raise the subject again, against a background of talks about ending the war.Also in Windsor, President Steinmeier will lay flowers at the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II in St George's Chapel.Sir Keir Starmer will host a meeting with President Steinmeier at Downing Street, along with UK and German business leaders, emphasising the importance of economic ties.It follows the \"Kensington Treaty\" signed this summer between the UK and Germany, which included closer co-operation on defence and plans for easier travel between the two countries, including a direct rail link.Events will show the cultural links between the countries, including a sleigh designed in 1845 by the German-born Prince Albert, who was married to Queen Victoria.Ms Budenbender will visit the Judith Kerr Primary School, in south-east London, to mark the connection to its namesake, Judith Kerr, the German-born author of the children's book The Tiger Who Came to Tea.Oxford University will award an honorary degree to President Steinmeier, on a trip where he will learn about medical research at the university.A visit by President Steinmeier to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will include meeting German footballers in the Premier League.And at the V&A East Storehouse, which has put the museum's archive on show, the visitors will see the David Bowie Centre, which contains items related to the pop star, such as stage outfits and musical instruments.Bowie had strong associations with Berlin, having lived and worked in the city in the 1970s.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentEPAResident doctors last walked out in November, demonstrating in Liverpool (pictured) as well as across EnglandThe British Medical Association has announced a fresh round of strikes in England in the long-running pay dispute.Resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, will stage a five-day walkout from 17 December.This will be the 14th strike by the doctors' union since March 2023 and is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.NHS bosses said it was an \"inflammatory act\" by the BMA as the lead up to Christmas was always challenging.But the union said it had been left with no choice because it had not received a credible offer from the government.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care, with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: \"This is an inflammatory act by the BMA.\"Everyone knows in the run-up to Christmas we need all hands on deck.\"It's really important to be able to discharge as many patients as possible so that where appropriate they can be at home with their loved ones.\"It's totally unfair to patients and to other staff working for the NHS.\"Both sides need to get back round the table to break the logjam.\"The walkout follows a five-day strike held last month and that came after talks broke down between the government and union.The government had offered doctors a deal which involved creating more training posts, improving working conditions and helping them with out-of-pocket expenses such as exam fees.But the BMA turned that down, saying any deal needed to involve an increase in pay.Health Secretary Wes Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.But the union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Dr Jack Fletcher, chairman of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said as the government had failed to come forward with a credible plan the union had been left with no choice.But he added: \"These [strikes] do not need to go ahead. Gradually raising pay over a few years and some common-sense fixes to the job security of our doctors are well within the reach of this government.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"The BMA have clearly chosen to strike when it will cause maximum disruption, causing untold anxiety. “Patients and NHS staff deserve better than this cynical attempt to wreck Christmas.”The BMA's mandate for strike action ends in early January, but it has announced it will be holding another ballot of members.",

    "body": "La Voix drops out of Strictly after injury15 hours agoPatrick JacksonBBCStrictly Come Dancing contestant La Voix has been forced to leave the competition after sustaining an injury.The drag queen's departure was announced by presenter Tess Daly at the start of Saturday's episode from Blackpool, saying she had had to withdraw on medical advice.It had been reported earlier that she could not perform on Saturday but there had been hopes she would return next week with dance partner Aljaž Škorjanec.\"This isn't the ending I imagined, but I'll cherish this forever,\" the performer, 45, said in a post in Instagram.Le Voix's departure is the latest in a series of injuries to hit the show's contestants. As a result, no-one will be eliminated in a dance-off on this week's show, with the votes being carried over. La Voix is the alter ego of Chris Dennis, who said ahead of the series that he wanted viewers to get to know the man behind the drag act.The character became a fan favourite last year while finishing as a finalist on RuPaul's Drag Race UK.Exact details of the injury were not revealed. \"My spirit wanted to keep dancing but my foot has other ideas,\" La Voix said in her Instagram post. She added: \"Due to an injury, I've been advised that I'm unable to perform.\"In recent weeks, Strictly viewers have seen La Voix and Škorjanec jive, waltz and foxtrot around the Strictly dancefloor.Last month, actor and Neighbours star Stefan Dennis withdrew from Strictly because of injury while in September, TV personality Dani Dyer pulled out before the show got under way after breaking her ankle. She was replaced by actress Amber Davies.",

    "body": "30 minutes agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondent  and Becky Morton,Political reporterRail fares in England are to be frozen next year for the first time in 30 years, the government has announced.The freeze until March 2027 will apply to regulated fares, which includes season tickets and off-peak returns.The most recent fare rise, in March 2025, was 4.6%. Rail fares traditionally have gone up in January, based on the July rate of the retail price index (RPI) + 1% -  although this formula has not always been followed.The announcement comes days before the chancellor sets out the government's financial plans in the Budget on Wednesday, with Rachel Reeves indicating that cutting the cost of living will be a key focus.However, at the same time the chancellor is also widely expected to increase taxes to help fill a multibillion-pound gap in her spending plans.About 45% of rail fares are regulated by the government in England, Wales and Scotland - but the freeze only relates to travel in England. The announcement also only applies to services run by England-based train operating companies.Regulated fares include season tickets covering most commuter routes, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and flexible tickets for travel in and around major cities.Train operators are free to set prices for unregulated fares, but they typically rise by similar amounts.The government said freezing rail fares was intended to \"directly limit inflation\" by holding down \"a major component of everyday costs\".Since 2021, the annual increase has come in March instead of January.A government source acknowledged it was possible unregulated fares would still rise, but insisted they usually followed regulated fares.Unregulated fares increased by 5.5% in the year to March 2025, 1.1% above regulated fares - with a total increase in rail fares of 5.1% in that period.Challenged over whether other ticket prices would rise to compensate for the freeze on regulated fares, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander insisted the policy was \"fully funded\".She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that regulated fares have tended to inform the price of unregulated fares and they normally \"track against each other\".Pressed on whether the policy would mean the government has less to spend on upgrading the transport system, Alexander said investment in the rail network would be protected \"because we recognise that investing in the infrastructure of this country is the right long-term decision\".The Rail Delivery Group, a representative body made up of the UK's rail operators, said the freeze would be \"good news for customers\".\"We want our railways to thrive, that's why we're committed to working with government to ensure upcoming railway reforms deliver real benefits for customers,\" a spokesperson said. Since 1996, the government has regulated some train fares following the privatisation of British Rail. The freeze marks the first point since then that fares will have been frozen, although there have been periods where price increases were below RPI, and a dip in prices following the financial crash in 2010. The government estimates that the move will save commuters on more expensive routes more than £300.The chancellor said the freeze was being put in place to help ease cost of living pressures, and make \"travelling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier\".The transport secretary said it was part of \"wider plans to rebuild Great British Railways\".Great British Railways is a public body which is in the process of being set up, and is part of the government's plans to bring parts of the railway system into public ownership. The government has said it will take over the running and management of the tracks and trains, \"ending years of fragmentation, driving up standards for passengers, and making journey easier and better value for money\".The government has said part of its plans for the new body is to \"gradually move away from annual blanket increases\".Labour said passengers had faced \"relentless\" fare increases every year under the previous Tory government. However, shadow transport secretary Richard Holden said: \"In government, the Conservatives kept fares on the right track with below-inflation rises and consistently called for no further hikes to protect hard-working commuters.\"Liberal Democrat transport spokesperson Olly Glover welcomed the freeze but said it was \"too little, too late for millions of commuters who have faced years of eye-watering price hikes\".He added: \"We need a real long-term plan to deliver a reliable, affordable railway, not just a temporary political fix days before a tough Budget.\"The pre-Budget period has been dominated by months of speculation about which taxes could increase, with multiple potential measures floated in the media.Former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said the leaks had been \"costly for the economy\" and \"caused paralysis among businesses and consumers\".\"It's the single biggest reason why [economic] growth has flatlined,\" he told the BBC.However, he acknowledged pre-Budget leaks had also happened under previous governments and the \"budgetary process has been degraded over many years\".In response, Alexander said the Budget process had taken place \"on shifting sands\", with a downgrade to productivity forecasts and \"a very challenging global economic environment\".The transport secretary said there was always speculation ahead of a Budget, but the chancellor had been clear about her priorities while being \"open and honest\" with the public.",

    "body": "12 hours agoOlga Prosvirova & Zlata OnufrievaBBC News RussianAishat Baimuradova/Getty/BBCAishat told her friends she had been raised in a strictly religious familyWhen 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home earlier this year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted.Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram.She told her new friends she could finally breathe.In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoBen ChuPolicy and analysis correspondent, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget is expected to justify tax increases as a vital measure to keep the UK's national debt under control.Some have argued keeping the national debt down protects the financial interests of younger people. That's because if the country's debt went up drastically, it is younger people who would have to foot the bill to pay for the interest on it. And it would be taken directly from their payslips through higher taxes.Generation Z, or those born between 1997 and 2012, have been hit in the pocket over the past 15 years by benefit cuts and dramatic increases in university tuition fees. Meanwhile, the homeownership rate of those born since the 1990s is well below that of earlier generations, due to the relative difficulty they have faced in getting on the housing ladder.However, most politicians, including the chancellor, are also committing to keep paying for the triple lock on the state pension, which guarantees it rises each year by the highest of average wages, inflation or 2.5%.There's growing concern that current tax and spending policies help pensioners but are unfair on younger generations, and that the triple lock in particular will push up public spending and the national debt in the long term.So will this budget really help younger generations? Or could it help saddle them with higher taxes and more debt?BBC Verify has been looking at the numbers.Why is the national debt a concern?The UK's national debt currently stands at just under 100% of UK GDP, which is the value of all the goods and services produced by the economy in a year.The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), has warned it could rise above 250% over the next 50 years unless taxes are raised or public spending is reduced.Some economists doubt such a steep and sustained debt surge would actually materialise, arguing it would likely trigger a bond market crisis long before then and see UK government borrowing costs pushed to extreme levels by private investors, which would instead force a change in tax policy or spending.Yet the OBR says the purpose of its long-term projection is to highlight that the UK's public finances are currently on what it calls an \"unsustainable\" trajectory.The biggest driver of rising long-term spending, and therefore the increase in the national debt according to the OBR, is our ageing population, which means the government needs to spend more money on the NHS, social care and the state pension each year.The number of people over 65 is projected to rise from 13 million to 22 million over the next five decades. That would push up the old age dependency ratio - the proportion of older people over the age of 65 relative to people aged 16 to 64 - from around 30% today to almost 50% by 2070.Today the state pension age is 66, but for people born after 1990 it's likely to be pushed higher to keep people working longer and reduce the old-age dependancy ratio.Even so, the national debt would still likely increase significantly from today's level because of these old age spending pressures.Do younger people lose out on public spending decisions?Since 2010, government policy on benefits has tended to help older generations and to take money away from younger generations.Over the past 15 years, the over 65s have received on average an extra £900 a year, while those under 65 have lost an average of £1,400 a year, according to calculations by the Resolution Foundation think tank.The driving force behind this has been the value of the state pension increasing faster than average wages since 2010 because of the triple lock, alongside government cuts to working-age benefits, including housing benefits, unemployment benefits and universal credit.The OBR projects that the triple lock will continue to push up state pension spending further in the coming decades.If the state pension were only tied to increases in average wages then its share of GDP would only rise from 5% today to 6% in 2070, according to the OBR. But instead it projects the cost of the triple lock will push government spending on the state pension to nearly 8% over the next 45 years.That might only be two extra percentage points, but it equates to around £60bn in today's money, and it would be younger working age people who would have to pay for it through their taxes.Which generations will benefit and lose from the Budget?The impact on different age groups will depend on which taxes increase and which benefits are protected.For instance, if high value homes were to face extra taxes, it would affect older people more as they tend to have greater property wealth.If you look at earnings, pensioners still have to pay income tax but are no longer subject to employee National Insurance.And younger people are deemed to have been hit harder by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions Rachel Reeves introduced in her first budget in October 2024, which appears to have slowed down job hiring rates.All taxpayers have a shared interest in seeing the debt burden brought under control as a share of the size of the economy. Though one of the reasons the government borrows is to pay for investment in infrastructure such as roads and housing. Some economists warn that if ministers reduced that kind of spending and borrowing out of concern over the national debt it could prove counterproductive and ultimately damaging to younger people.As for the triple lock, younger people could benefit from its continuation when they eventually retire themselves - and polling shows that 18-49 year olds are broadly in favour of keeping the policy.Nevertheless, in the context of the past 15 years, many economists argue younger people also have an interest in seeing a rebalancing of the treatment of older and younger generations through the tax and benefit system.",

I think it's great,\" he said. \"I love meeting people who really felt this was part of their childhood.\"Grint, 37, who played Ron in all eight of the franchise's movies, also revealed he has written a letter to the child actor playing Ron in the upcoming TV series.\"It's quite strange to have the cycle happening again,\" he said. \"I'm really intrigued what it's going to be like.\"Grint was speaking to BBC News at an event to switch on the Christmas lights in Highgate, north London, on Wednesday.The actor, who lives locally with his partner, actress Georgia Groome, and their two daughters, drew a crowd of fans to the Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution.Getty ImagesEmma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint were the main stars throughout the film franchiseAs children, Grint and his co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson had their lives transformed by their wizarding roles in the big-screen adaptation of JK Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.Grint was 11 when he was cast as Ron - who is characterised as one of Harry Potter's best friends at Hogwarts - and now describes the experience as being \"crazy\".\"It changed my whole life quite quickly,\" he said. \"I was a huge fan of the books, so for me it was like stepping into the books, and that was very special.\"Would Rupert Grint step back into the Harry Potter universe?Since the Potter films ended, Grint has had roles in films including Into the White, and in Apple TV series Servant. He's also appeared on stage, and in a number of Ed Sheeran's music videos.He told us he has \"a couple of things\" coming up next year, though he is not able to talk about them yet.But compared with Radcliffe and Watson, Grint has found it relatively hard to break out of his Potter role.Is he fed up of always being linked to a part he played decades ago? \"No, absolutely not, I love it,\" he said.\"It has a quite deep meaning to a lot of people of my generation, and even more to generations who are finding it now. It's great. It gives me a lot of pride. It was such a huge thing.\"I don't think I'll ever quite step out of his shadow, but I'm fine with that.\"Getty ImagesDaniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint on the set of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2006The three child actors who will play Harry, Ron and Hermione in the new HBO series were announced in May.Earlier this week, Radcliffe revealed he had sent a letter to Dominic McLaughlin, who is taking over the role of Harry.Grint told us he has done the same with Alastair Stout, who will play Ron.\"I wrote him a letter, before they started, passing the baton as it were,\" he said.HBOArabella Stanton, Dominic McLaughlin and Alastair Stout were announced in May as the stars of the upcoming Harry Potter TV series\"It was really just wishing him all the best with it. I had so much fun stepping into this world, and I hope he has the same experience,\" he said.Grint said that when the new actors were announced, it took him \"straight back\" to when he, Radcliffe and Watson were cast. \"I still remember every second of it,\" he said.He sees \"a bit of family resemblance\" between himself and Stout.\"I think it's great that it's a whole new thing. It's going to be its own thing, and I think that will be fun,\" he added.He wouldn't discourage his children if they wanted to take on roles in the TV adaptation in the future, though.\"I don't see why not. It was so much fun,\" he said.Grint added the films were \"still a little bit too scary\" for his five-year-old daughter, named Wednesday, but she has watched some clips. \"And she loves it,\" he added.Getty ImagesRupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson with author JK Rowling at the world film premiere of Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone in 2001While Grint has largely been less prolific since the heyday of the Harry Potter films, in 2020, he was one of several stars of the Potter franchise who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author spoke out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.As a row grew, the writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.In September, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refused to \"cancel her out\" despite their differences on the subject. But her remarks were met with a stinging response from Rowling, who dismissed her as \"ignorant\".Grint, for his part, declined to comment on the row when we asked him about it on Wednesday.Could the future spell a return to wizardry for Grint? When asked whether he would follow in the footsteps of co-star Tom Felton - who recently returned as Draco Malfoy on Broadway - he said: \"Maybe in the future. Never say never.\"Getty ImagesTom Felton, who also starred in the Harry Potter films, has recently taken on a new Broadway role\"But for now, I think as much as I loved it, I'm enjoying stepping outside of that world,\" he added - even as Ron's shadow looms large.And if that wizardry could offer him the benefit of hindsight, which Hogwarts house would he be sorted into? \"I think I'm probably more Hufflepuff than Gryffindor,\" he admits.\"I like the vibe of Hufflepuff, I think. But Gryffindor is a close second.\"",

    "body": "In Ukraine's 'kill-zone', robots are a lifeline to troops trapped on perilous eastern front5 hours agoAbdujalil AbdurasulovIn eastern UkraineA robot being sent on a mission by Ukraine's fifth brigade to deliver supplies to troops on the frontline\"The toy is delivered,\" a Ukrainian soldier whispers into the radio.In the dead of night, he and his partner move quickly to roll out their cargo from a van. Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.Vitsik via BBCCombat medic 'Vitsik' was caught up in an almost hour long drone attack in the \"kill-zone\" when attempting to evacuate the woundedThanks to those \"first-person view\" drones, Russian troops are close to cutting off all routes leading to Pokrovsk.They claim to have surrounded the entire area, but Kyiv has repeatedly denied that.The head of Ukraine's HUR intelligence agency, Kyrylo Budanov, has told local media the situation in Pokrovsk is \"extremely difficult\" but Ukraine is \"still holding on there\".And yet moving troops into and around the city is extremely dangerous and Ukrainian forces have tried to limit rotating people in and out due to the high risks.As a result, soldiers remain in frontline positions for weeks, sometimes even months.It has made delivering supplies an even more pressing task, and that means the demand for unmanned ground vehicles is growing.A single unit of the 5th brigade can carry out several logistical missions with UGVs in one day.Each assignment starts in an old, shabby garage and the mission I watch is delivering water, ammunition and fuel to drone pilots.Vitsikkk via BBCPokrovsk is largely deserted but as a key road and rail junction, it is essential for Ukraine to keep the city from Russian controlSupplies are loaded on a land drone called Termit, capable of carrying about 200kg. The operator drives it by remote control into the back of a van which takes it closer to the frontline to preserve its battery.When it is dark, two soldiers jump out of the van and roll out the UGV.One of them informs the control room via radio that the land drone has been offloaded. Within seconds the operator several kilometres away confirms he is connected to the machine and Termit heads off to its destination.Machines like Termit have been used by some Ukrainian brigades since last year but they have become increasingly popular in recent months.At a workshop for the 79th brigade, engineers who previously made only aerial remote-controlled drones are now tasked with upgrading unmanned ground vehicles for use in combat zones.They apply camouflage, weld new platforms and add hardware for extra communication. But even with these improvements, UGVs are still vulnerable to drone attacks.Engineers are increasingly tasked to make the land drones combat zone ready adding camouflage and extra communication links \"No matter how well it is concealed, no matter what connection you use and how quickly it moves\", the machine can still be detected and destroyed, says a UGV operator with the call sign \"Lawyer\".During one mission to evacuate a wounded soldier from Pokrovsk, his unmanned vehicle hit a landmine damaging its tracks.Another land drone was sent on a rescue mission from a different unit, but it was destroyed too. Lawyer still does not know if the wounded soldier made it out alive.On average just one out of three UGVs manages to reach the city, says Ihor, from the unmanned systems department of the 7th Corps. While the majority of the small robots won't make it, the troops on the frontline are reliant on those that do.",

    "body": "At least 90 people have died and another 12 are missing after days of heavy rain in Vietnam led to flooding and landslides.The Vietnamese government says 186,000 homes have been damaged across the country, with more than three million livestock swept away. Officials estimate there has been hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage.The mountainous province of Dak Lak has been severely impacted, recording more than 60 deaths since 16 November, according to news agency AFP.The floods are the latest extreme weather event to hit Vietnam in recent months, after typhoons Kalmaegi and Bualoi hit the country within weeks of each other.Some 258,000 people were without power on Sunday morning and sections of major motorways and train tracks were blocked, officials said.Military and police resources have been mobilised to assist in the hardest hit areas.The government said the most severe impacts had been observed in five provinces - Quang Ngai, Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Khanh Hoa, and Lam Dong - clustered in south and south-central Vietnam.Mach Van Si, a farmer in Dak Lak, told AFP: \"Our neighbourhood was completely destroyed. Nothing was left. Everything was covered in mud.\"Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính chaired a virtual emergency meeting on Sunday morning from South Africa, where he had been attending the G20 summit. Rainfall had exceeded 1.5m (5ft) in several areas leading up to Friday, with some areas surpassing a 5.2m level not seen since 1993. The rain is forecast to ease in the coming days.Scientists say that Vietnam has been left more exposed to extreme weather events by human-driven climate change, which has made typhoons stronger and more frequent.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsAn Australian man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed Hollywood star Ariana Grande has been deported and banned from Singapore.Johnson Wen, 26, was sentenced to nine days in prison for being a public nuisance and has now been \"barred from re-entering Singapore\", the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) told local media. Wen pushed past photographers and charged at the actress and singer, who was attending the Asian premier for Wicked: For Good on 13 November. Co-star Cynthia Erivo wrestled him away from Grande. Wen has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, with many accusing him of re-traumatising Grande. The pop star has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her concert in Manchester in May 2017 killed 22 people and injured hundreds.During Wen's trial, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the film's premiere twice, according to Singaporean media.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and pinned him down.Wen later posted videos thanking Grande for letting him on the carpet and said he was \"free\". Police arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance, to which Wen pleaded guilty. The District Judge Christopher Goh was quoted by Channel News Asia as saying that Wen was \"attention seeking\", adding that he was wrong to think he would not suffer any consequences. Grande has not commented on the case. Erivo spoke about the incident to NBC, saying that she \"just wanted to make sure my friend was safe\".\"I'm sure he didn't mean us harm, but you never know with those things, and I wanted to make sure that she was OK. That was my first instinct,\" she said. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoJustin Rowlatt,Climate Editor and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondentgettyCOP30 President President André Corrêa do Lago at a critical moment in the final plenary session of talksIn three decades of these meetings aimed at forging global consensus on how to prevent and deal with global warming, this will go down as among the most divisive.Many countries were livid when COP30 in Belém, Brazil ended on Saturday with no mention of the fossil fuels that have heated up the atmosphere. Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated.The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change.Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the \"COP of truth\".Brazil - not their finest hourThe most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloatBut many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted.And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting.Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible.So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP.The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations.Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that.While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return.Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas.To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion.It made matters worse.Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy.The EU were given short shrift by major producers.\"We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,\" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer.Ouch!Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse.Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP.These were heartily applauded in the plenary halls – but their legal standing is uncertain.Tom Ingham/BBCThe EU negotiating team at the COP30 plenaryEU had a bad COPThey are the richest group of nations still in the Paris Agreement but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour.While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of.The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft.The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the \"tripling\" word stayed in the text.So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in.\"Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,\" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics.\"This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European Union.\"The EU fulminated but apart from shifting the tripling of finance from 2030 to 2035, they had to go along with the deal, and they achieved very little on the fossil fuel front.Getty ImagesProtestors at COP30 stage a demonstration at the start of negotiations in BelémFuture of COP in questionThe most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself.Two often heard positions:How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words?How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks?The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore.\"We can't discard it entirely,\" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News.\"But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far.\"Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people.It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore.Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an \"implementation cop\" and put a lot of focus on the \"energy agenda\". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant.COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance.Trade comes in from the coldFor the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an \"orchestrated\" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G.'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking.The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it.They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - \"unilateral\" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive.The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad.If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves.Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials.The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization.Tom Ingham/BBCHuge crowds looking for souvenirs crowded into the Chinese pavilion at COP30Trump gains by staying away - China gains by staying quietThe world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways.US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here.Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps. And while Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers were predictably hostile to curbing fossil fuels, China stayed quiet and concentrated on doing deals. And ultimately, say experts, the business China is doing will outdo the US and their efforts to sell fossil fuels.\"China kept a low political profile,\" says Li Shuo from the Asia Society.\"And they focussed on making money in the real world.\"\"Solar is the cheapest source of energy, and the long term direction is very clear, China dominates in this sector and that puts the US in a very difficult position.\"",

Well not so hasty. As far as the meteorological calendar is concerned, we are still counting down the final days of autumn, notable this year for its vibrant autumn colours and changeable, whiplash-like weather patterns. We've had records for the warmest November overnight minimums to the coldest November nights for 15 years.So, if after the Arctic blast we've just experienced this is still autumn, when will we see the official start of winter?Defining the start of winterThere are two common ways to define the start of our seasons in the UK-  meteorological and astronomical.BBC Weather follows the meteorological calendar, where winter always begins on 1 December and ends on the last day of February. Meteorologists use fixed three month periods for each season, which makes year-on-year comparisons between them easier. Astronomical winter starts on the 21 December, known as the winter solstice and is the shortest day of the year. The season then runs until the vernal or spring equinox which in 2026 is Friday 20 March. Image source, BBC Weather Watcher / One Man MarvelImage caption, The recent chilly snap created this perfect snowy scene in North YorkshireWhat makes winter winter?We define winter as the three coldest months - December, January and February - and when we look at a list of record low temperatures from across the UK we can see why. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the UK is –27.2C (–17.0F), reached on three separate occasions in Scotland:Braemar, Aberdeenshire, on 11 February 1895 and 10 January 1982Altnaharra, Sutherland, on 30 December 1995Other national record lows include:England: –26.1C (–15.0F) in Newport, Shropshire, on 10 January 1982Wales: –23.3C (–9.9F) in Rhayader, Powys, on 21 January 1940Northern Ireland: –18.7C (–1.7F) in Castlederg, County Tyrone, on 24 December 2010But the UK does not often experience prolonged very cold weather, and some winters are so mild that it feels as if we skipped the season all together.In February 2019 England and Wales saw an exceptional spell of warmth, with temperatures rising above 20C on more than one occasion. What impact is climate change having on winter?Image source, BBC Weather Watcher / HanaImage caption, Mild and sunny winter scene in Stornoway in the Western IslesUK winters are becoming warmer and wetter due to human-driven climate change. Long term data shows rising average temperatures and fewer cold weather extremes.With global temperatures continuing to rise UK winters are now about 1C warmer than a century ago. The decade 2015–2024 has been 1.24C warmer than the 1961–1990 average. Indeed, six of the ten warmest UK winters on record have occurred since 2000.Globally 2023 was the warmest year on record where most days in December broke temperature records.Air and ground frosts have fallen by around 25% since the 1980s, and snow days are becoming increasingly rare across the UK.A warming world means we are more likely to see winter precipitation fall as rain rather than snow, external.However, even in a warming climate the UK can still experience spells of extreme cold. In 2018 the infamous Beast from the East brought severe wintry conditions to many parts of Europe leading to significant disruption, and its impact lingered well into meteorological spring.",

    "body": "3 days agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterFriends fans in the US can finally watch the last eight episodes of the hit sitcom's ill-fated spin-off show Joey, starring Matt LeBlanc as the hapless but loveable Joey Tribbiani.The 2004 NBC sitcom was cancelled in 2006 midway through its second season following poor ratings, meaning US fans never got to see the final instalments.Now, almost 20 years later, those episodes have been made available to watch on the Friends YouTube channel.The show, which first aired just four months after Friends ended, saw Joey move to Los Angeles, where, ironically, his new sitcom was cancelled, forcing him to move in with family.\"To the person that runs the Friends YouTube channel, thank you,\" one fan wrote. \"I never got a chance to watch this series and the fact that you kept with it is amazing.\"Another wrote: \"The show, despite its critics, made me laugh on every episode and rewatching it now after all these years was therapeutic. Farewell Joey, you have made an impact in my life and I will cherish it.\"Someone else said: \"I hope Matt Le Blanc and the rest of the cast read the comments on this channel some day and realise that, contrary to public opinion, there was a community that absolutely adored this TV show.\"The cast also included Jennifer Coolidge, Drea de Matteo, Paulo Costanzo, Miguel A. Núñez Jr and Ben Falcone.While Joey's pilot episode was watched by a decent 18.6 million viewers, ratings slid as the series progressed, averaging 10.2 million viewers in its first season and 7.1 million in its second.Joey was then removed from its Thursday slot - the same one that Friends had aired in - in December 2005, returning to NBC on Tuesdays in March 2006.It was pulled again, this time after just one more episode. The show was officially cancelled after two seasons in May the same year.Some international fans were able to watch the full two seasons in their own countries at the time.UK fans could watch on Channel 5, which aired the second season aired in its entirety in 2007.Joey has a 50% rating on film review site Rotten Tomatoes - compared with 78% for Friends.",

    "body": "The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy has announced her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer.Tatiana Schlossberg said she has been given less than a year to live.The 35-year-old shared the news in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.The mother-of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's position as US health secretary under President Donald Trump. In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her second cousin be approved to the post as she was battling her illness. Schlossberg is the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy. She is the granddaughter of John F. Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. According to Schlossberg's essay titled A Battle With My Blood, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May 2024.She described her previously healthy lifestyle, which included running, skiing and even once swimming in New York's Hudson River, \"eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\".Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, she said doctors have told her the outcome does not look good. \"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she writes. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me.\" Schlossberg's son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline died of cancer when Schlossberg was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and Japan. \"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" she writes. \"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\" She also described her upset at watching her second cousin, known as RFK Jr - whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for president - become Trump's health secretary.\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she writes. \"Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.\"Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is planning to run for Congress in New York. He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption: \"Life is short - let it rip.\"The Kennedy family's generations-spanning participation in US politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGeorgia Roberts,Political correspondent and Patrick JacksonThe government is expected to announce an extra £1.3bn in funding for a scheme encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs) at next week's Budget. The Electric Car Grant scheme started in July as part of the move to zero emission vehicles. The government says it has helped 35,000 switch to EVs.However, early research suggests there is little indication the scheme has attracted entirely new buyers. There will also be money to create more charging points, and a consultation on helping people without driveways to charge their cars. It is also possible EV owners could face a new tax elsewhere in Wednesday's Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge in future.Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander the told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that subsidising EV sales would support economic growth.\"This is an investment in the country's future... and the good quality manufacturing jobs associated with that,\" she said, pointing to production of the Nissan Leaf in Sunderland.\"So making sure that we are enabling people to buy a new electric vehicle if that's what they want to do, whilst also investing in charging infrastructure, it is the right long-term decision.\"All new cars will have to be electric or hybrid from 2030, when a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars comes into force.The Electric Car Grant scheme, which provides a discount of up to £3,750 on eligible vehicles, was launched with an initial fund of £650m.New AutoMotive, a non-profit organisation supporting the UK's transition to electric vehicles, found in a recent study that the scheme had yet to expand the market for EVs.EVs covered by the scheme made up 23.8% of new registrations in September, the same as their share before the Electric Car Grant was announced, New Automotive said.\"It isn't yet clear that it's prompting consumers to consider buying cars that they wouldn't have gone ahead and bought anyway,\" David Farrar, policy manager for New AutoMotive, said at the time.The Budget is also expected to announce a further £200m for speeding up the rollout of chargepoints across the UK.Data from Zapmap shows almost 87,000 points across the UK, in about 44,000 locations. Those include places like supermarket car parks and lamppost chargers.\"The proposed funding will support the creation of thousands of charge points and provide extra resources for local authorities to ramp up charging infrastructure on local streets - making it easier for everyone to access reliable charging, including those without off-street parking,\" the government said.Chancellor Rachel Reeves, it added, was \"expected to publish a consultation on Permitted Development Rights to make it easier and cheaper for people without a driveway to charge\".However, it is also possible that EV owners could face a new tax in the Budget in the form of a pay-per-mile charge from 2028 to mirror the fuel duty that drivers of petrol and diesel cars pay. The shift towards electric vehicles means the government will get less revenue from fuel duties in the coming years.The transport secretary did not rule out a new tax on EV drivers' road use, saying support for the transition to EVs needed to be balanced with a \"fair vehicle taxation system for all motorists\".\"EV [drivers], like drivers of petrol and diesel cars, are driving on roads that require maintenance.\"\"We've got ageing infrastructure, motorways that were built back in the sixties and seventies,\" Alexander said.\"We need to have a fair taxation system that is future-focused, but we're not going to do anything to jeopardise the transition to electric vehicles,\" she said.Reeves is being urged not to raise taxes on drivers overall, with campaigners preparing to deliver a petition to Downing Street early next week which calls for fuel duty, long frozen, not to be increased.Richard Holden, the shadow transport secretary, said that \"handing out £1.5bn in EV subsidies while hard-working taxpayers are squeezed dry\" was \"madness\".\"Ordinary families are facing increased taxes and spiralling inflation under Labour, yet the government's priority is handing out discounts on new electric cars,\" the Conservative MP said.  Reeves is expected to increase some taxes in the Budget after saying she means to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.",

    "body": "A private jet and massive debt - the rise and fall of a £1m Glastonbury ticket scammer6 hours agoCarlo Mole, Laura Gaynor and Joseph LeeBBC/SpunGold TV/Getty ImagesMiles Hart struck deals to sell £1m of Glastonbury tickets - then vanishedMiles Hart had a reputation as a guy who could get anything. Friends from the elite private school he used to attend say he once surprised them with an all-expenses-paid trip to Paris on a private jet with less than 24 hours notice.So when he started selling Glastonbury tickets, hospitality passes and VIP Access All Areas passes - claiming he had privileged access because of land his family owned near the festival site, or by working with a company at the event - many of his former schoolmates jumped at the chance.Within a couple of years, his sales had gone global, as he struck deals to sell about £1m of passes to punters who had missed out in the annual scramble for official tickets on the Glastonbury website.But as the day of the 2024 festival approached, Miles's promises of tickets proved to be a mirage, created out of false invoices and fake email addresses. Miles, now 27, went into hiding.How did Miles Hart get away with it? The BBC has spoken to some of his former friends to trace the rise of a scammer brazen enough to lie to his dead friend's family and to run up tens of thousands of pounds in unpaid debts to his godmother along the way. Behind him, he left a trail of destruction: debt, anger and threats.'Crazy amounts of money'Miles Hart was sociable, clever and witty - the joker of the group. That is how he is remembered by some of his former friends at Millfield School, which is famous for producing multiple Olympians and sports stars such as Formula One driver Lando Norris.The £12,000-a-term school in Somerset is just a few miles from Glastonbury Festival's famous Pyramid Stage. \"Everyone wanted to be there. Miles was someone who could get you in,\" says Elle, who knew him from the age of 10.Millfield SchoolMiles got friends into Glastonbury when they all attended nearby Millfield SchoolGlastonbury Festival is one of the hottest tickets in the world, usually selling out within minutes. The festival says only tickets bought from its official seller See Tickets are valid and they are linked to photo ID to keep them out of the hands of touts. But if anyone could offer an alternative way in, they would be able to demand a high price.Elle says Miles got her a wristband for entry one year and they went to the festival together. After they left school, he began selling tickets.Seb, another former Millfield pupil two years older than Miles, says he bought a ticket from him for the 2022 festival, the first one since Covid.He says Miles had told him he had 42 hospitality tickets to sell, which he had been given because his family rented out land for luxury tents at the festival. \"I thought it was like an exclusive opportunity and I really didn't want to miss out,\" Seb says.But two days before the festival, after chasing Miles for months, Seb says he contacted Glastonbury Festival to confirm the allocation of hospitality passes. The festival told him it had never heard of Miles. Seb's attempted calls to him afterwards were declined.\"I had heard anecdotally that he was partying in Paris and that made me feel incredibly bitter,\" Seb says.BBC/SpunGold TVFriends wondered how Miles could afford his extravagant lifestyleElle's best friend Cian had also given Miles money for tickets that year and asked for her help in getting it back. Then other mutual friends got in touch to ask Elle if she knew Miles, saying they had also been scammed.A few months later, Cian died suddenly from a heart attack. Elle and another friend flew out for the funeral in New Zealand, where Cian's family are from. Cian's mother asked Elle to get Miles to pay back the £500 he owed, to help with the funeral costs.Miles sent a voice note saying the money was already in the post. But three years on, the family have received nothing.In 2023, Miles was at it again, selling Glastonbury tickets to about 50 people and failing to deliver. Kate, another of Miles's old friends, says she was added to a WhatsApp group with former school friends and acquaintances who said they had been ripped off.More people in their social circle were added, Kate says. Some said Miles had borrowed money and not repaid it, while one person posted a receipt from a London nightclub with a staggering bill, saying: \"Where's your friend? He owes me £200k.\"People speculated about how Miles maintained his extravagant lifestyle; Kate and Elle wondered if their surprise trip to Paris the previous year had been paid for with \"scammed money\".\"Everyone knows someone who knows someone who's been scammed by him,\" Elle says. \"And all the whilst he was doing this, he was going on like really crazy bougie holidays and spending crazy amounts of money that probably wasn't his.\"Elle says this is the moment when she decided she wanted to find out how far the lies had gone.But Miles was about to pull off his biggest scam yet.'Shut the whole thing down'In the run-up to Glastonbury 2024, some punters who had missed out on the official sale were trying to score tickets from two other sources: an Ibiza promoter called Kai Cant who had put out an Instagram story saying he could get hospitality tickets for £1,350, and a company called Star Gaze Entertainment.Both of them had, in turn, been promised the tickets by Miles Hart.One of Kai's customers, a DJ called Danny, was told that Miles had said he ran a catering firm working in the hospitality areas at the festival, which gave him access to tickets. Danny was also told that Miles had said his mother, Susannah Hart, could get tickets through her connections as a local councillor, and that she was not someone who would ruin her reputation by becoming involved in anything shady.In fact, Somerset councillors have no special access to Glastonbury Festival and Susannah Hart had no involvement in Miles's ticket schemes.One of the people who worked at Star Gaze as a summer job, Will, told the BBC he had sold hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of tickets for the company, but he did not know who was supplying them.Getty ImagesGlastonbury tickets are in huge demand and usually sell out within minutesIn total, customers of Kai and Star Gaze spent almost £1m on Glastonbury tickets to be supplied by Miles Hart.With weeks to go, Will says the calls and emails to Star Gaze from people asking where their tickets were had become incessant. In group chats, Kai's customers were also suspicious they had been ripped off.\"If this was all a big scam, would I be on the phone to you now?\" Miles said in one voice note message to a panicked Kai.Miles said he did not want to entrust the tickets to the postal system, so he arranged to meet Kai's customers in hotels across England to hand them over personally. Will travelled to meet him at a pub in Glastonbury to pick up the Star Gaze customers' tickets.They waited for hours with no sign of Miles, in Glastonbury or at any of the hotel meet-ups. Customers could not reach him because he had always phoned them with his caller ID hidden.Danny says his phone suddenly received a call from a hidden number and he knew it was Miles. \"I've had problems with my phone,\" Miles said to explain his silence. He said the tickets had fallen through because \"Glastonbury have found out about them and shut the whole thing down\".BBC/SpunGold TVDanny, a DJ, was told by Miles the ticket sales had fallen through because Glastonbury had found outMiles was next seen in a clip on social media - with someone confronting him in the street and demanding his tickets or a full refund of £10,000 by the next day. \"Yeah, I've agreed to that,\" Miles is heard to say.And then, he vanished again.'Physical harm'Elle wanted to understand the extent of Miles's deception, so we travelled with her to meet his godmother, Annamaria.Years earlier, when Miles's mother Susannah was going through a divorce and was suffering financially with the mortgage and school fees, Annamaria had stepped in. She contributed to the school fees and took over the mortgage, intending to help the family renovate and sell their home.She says that Susannah Hart ended up owing her £300,000 in total, but that Susannah had refused to sell the house or to resolve the financial issues. Three court cases and three appeals later, and Annamaria ended up owning the house. Susannah Hart did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.When Annamaria put the house up for auction in 2023, to her surprise Miles was at the sale. He bid and won the house, giving a cheque of £90,000 for the deposit. But three days later, the cheque bounced.She sold the house to someone else, but under the rules of auctions, Miles still owes her the money. \"To this day, I don't understand why he did it,\" Annamaria says.In the house clearance, Annamaria found a box file filled with documents. She showed it to Elle: it contained dozens of bank cards in different names - the names of Elle's friends.BBC/SpunGold TVElle discovered Miles had bank cards in the names of many of their friendsElle spoke to her friends who said that, in the first year of university, Miles had asked several people if they wanted to make an easy £100. He told them he would sign them up for a bank account, send them the referral fee and cancel the card.Criminologist and financial crime expert Dr Nicola Harding told Elle that instead of cancelling the cards, it appeared that Miles had made their friends into \"money mules\" - people whose bank accounts are used by scammers to quickly create a chain of transactions and make illicit cash harder to track.\"I can't believe that he would, like, put those people - specifically that he was so close to - I just can't believe he put them in that position,\" Elle says.Other people felt the fallout from Miles's deceptions. Kai Cant went into hiding in Spain, saying on Instagram the scam had left him with debts of £500,000 and put his life at risk. And the new owner of Miles's home told the BBC how he and his wife had been threatened after their address had been posted online.Speaking anonymously, he said they had been visited by debt collectors, bailiffs, people owed money and, on one occasion, two \"very large men\" who appeared to want to \"cause us physical harm\".The new owner has now installed eight security cameras, automatic number plate recognition, facial recognition and a network of lasers to detect intruders. \"It really is like Fort Knox,\" he said.'An honest person'So where is Miles now? The BBC obtained a covert recording of Miles meeting an unknown man, apparently on the pretext of carrying out a business deal.In the recording, Miles says he is working for a client who has a \"huge cash flow issue\" and needs a loan. But Miles claims the client has assets worth almost a billion euros.The man asks about Miles's role and Miles admits he has \"debt that needs to be paid\". \"I was involved in something that went wrong,\" he says.Miles gives an account of how the festival ticket sale went wrong and says one group of customers are angry, but the rest are willing to wait for their money.The other man then says: \"What if I told you that I represent one of these groups? Some of the nastier groups. There's a lot of people wanting blood.\"He warns Miles that the debt - £480,000 to the group the man says he represents - is not going away, and Miles promises to pay within 56 days. \"I am an honest person,\" Miles says.BBC/SpunGold TVMiles's whereabouts are unknown - but he said there were \"errors\" in the allegations against himThat recording was made last summer, but the BBC understands Miles has not refunded anyone.Kai Cant said he has paid back everyone who bought tickets through him. Star Gaze Entertainment has shut down and Benjamin Harris, the company boss, cannot be found.The Metropolitan Police said it is investigating up to 50 allegations of ticket fraud relating to Glastonbury 2024.Miles Hart was contacted for comment and said, through lawyers, that there were numerous \"material errors\" in the allegations made against him and that some of the people who spoke to the BBC \"cannot be relied upon to represent an accurate portrayal of events\".His whereabouts are unknown, and he was last spotted at a pub near Glastonbury, a few days before this year's festival.This story is part of BBC Scam Safe Week, which brings together content from across the BBC to help the public stay informed in the fight against scams",

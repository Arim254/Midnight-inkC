    "body": "'The answer cannot be nothing': The battle over Canada's mystery brain disease1 day agoJoel Gunter,senior international reporter, New BrunswickandNadine Yousif,senior Canada reporter, New BrunswickBBCFive hundred people in a small Canadian province were diagnosed with a mystery brain disease. What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.A protest sign in New Brunswick. Some residents are angry about pesticide use in the province. (Chris Donovan/BBC)But the government had decided against examining any of the patients in person, an omission that outraged those who believed they were part of the cluster. The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches, hallucinations and seizures. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms that can have a psychological root - sometimes described as being an issue with the brain's 'software' rather than any structural damage. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero, and observed her having a seizure at the clinic. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"Partridge is still struggling with her condition, but she has received some treatment for FND and is pursuing more. And her diagnosis brought her some peace of mind. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.Global NewsGabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentReutersThe government has identified a legal basis which it believes can be used to allow UK military to board and detain vessels in so-called shadow fleets, BBC News understands.Russia, Iran and Venezuela have all been accused of operating ships without a valid national flag to avoid sanctions on oil.Last week British armed forces assisted US troops in seizing the Marinera oil tanker, which American officials accused of carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions.To date, no UK military personnel have boarded any vessels, but officials have spent the last few weeks exploring what measures could be used.The Sanctions and Money Laundering Act from 2018 can be used to approve the use of military force, ministers believe.It is understood there are plans for the armed forces to use these powers, in what is being described inside government as a ramping up of action against the ships. It is not known exactly when the first UK military action might occur.Two oil tankers subject to US sanctions were reportedly spotted sailing east through the English Channel towards Russia on Thursday.The UK has already imposed sanctions on more than 500 alleged shadow vessels, which it believes are helping to fund hostile activity, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Ministers say that action taken by the UK and its allies has forced around 200 ships off the seas, most of which will have been operating without a legitimate flag.Ship flagging is the process used to register a vessel to a specific country, which then allows it to travel in international waters and offers it certain protections under law.The government believes the new legal mechanism they have identified could be applied to any sanctioned vessels not legitimately flagged.Officials say this would have included the Marinera tanker, which was seized last week.The Marinera, a Venezuelan-linked ship previously known as the Bella 1, was stopped by the US Coast Guard as it travelled through the North Atlantic ocean between Iceland and Scotland.The Ministry of Defence said the US asked the UK for assistance, and that RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship RFA Tideforce took part in the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\", adding the UK \"will not stand by as malign activity increases on the high seas\".Healey told MPs on Wednesday that the government was \"stepping up action on the shadow fleet, developing further military options and strengthening co-ordination with allies\".It is understood that identifying this legal mechanism was one of the further military options that Healey was referring to.The US has increased action against shadow fleet vessels, with five tankers seized in recent weeks.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"The defence secretary set out in parliament this week that deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government\".They added: \"We will not comment on specific operational planning\".Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said on Sunday that the number of insurance checks were being increased, with more than 600 ships stopped while sailing close to the British Isles.Vessels not legitimately flagged generally have no insurance, which experts have warned could lead to a crisis if they were involved in an incident like an expensive oil spill.But Alexander said it would not be appropriate to say how many alleged shadow vessels were known to have sailed in UK waters.She told Sky News: \"Providing you with that information only helps one person and that is President Putin.\"",

Martin then made several guest appearances on the programme until his character suffered a fatal heart attack in 2016.In a statement shared on Sunday by his agent Sharon Henry, Martin's family described him as a father and friend who \"supported us through our highs and lows\", adding they would \"miss him terribly\".The statement said Martin - born in the East End of London himself, in Bow - had died on Saturday. \"For over 50 years, Derek was a truly authentic working-class voice in British television and film,\" it went on.Meanwhile, his agent said it was \"a privilege to be a part of his creative journey\" - and said he had \"cherished his time portraying Charlie Slater\".\"Derek was a devoted father, a generous member of the charitable Water Rats, an avid golfer and all-around good man who will be greatly missed,\" Henry added.Martin began acting in the 1960s, having previously worked in factories and as a butcher at Smithfield Market in the City of London.Despite having no professional training, he went on to appear in programmes such as Doctor Who,  Z-Cars, The Sweeney, Eldorado,  Law & Order and Hart to Hart, before landing the role of Charlie Slater.Martin, in character as Slater, stands beside Jessie Wallace, in character as his on-screen daughter Kat (file photo)An EastEnders spokesperson said the programme's team was \"deeply saddened\" to hear of Martin's death. \"From the moment he arrived, Derek's portrayal of Charlie Slater instantly cemented him in the hearts of the audience, as the head of one of EastEnders' most iconic families,\" they went on.\"Charlie would do anything for his family, and much like his character, Derek would do the same for those around him. Derek was deeply loved by all those that worked with him at EastEnders and will always be remembered with great fondness.\"Our love and thoughts are with his family and friends.\"",

The taxi driver was named as Masrob Ali, from Blackburn.Police have yet to formally identify the victims but are continuing to investigate what happened. The force is asking for eyewitnesses or anyone who may have dashcam footage of the moments before and afterwards to come forward.Neelam Khan, who lives with her family nearby, told BBC North West Tonight she had seen the aftermath of the crash on the road, \"which was quite disturbing\".Debris was \"everywhere, which was quite scary\", she said.Firefighters used cutting equipment to remove people from the car with five passengers taken to hospital for treatment.GMP's Ch Insp Helen McCormick described it as a \"devastating incident\".\"This was a particularly challenging scene for colleagues in the emergency services and I want to thank the first responders.\"Phil TaylorA local councillor said the community's mood was \"sombre\" after the deathsMother-of-two Khan said other crashes had happened on the road, with drivers hitting cars parked on the sides.\"I don't understand how people don't learn from previous accidents and this is probably the worst one yet,\" she said.\"It's probably only going to get worse if nothing happens so maybe the police and council need to do something about it.\"The number of crashes meant she and her husband were considering moving to a quieter area, she added.\"This is why we park at the back of the house now because we just know there's always going to be accidents on this road.\"Phil TaylorFive passengers were also injured in the crashMcCormick said the collision was \"a tragic reminder of the importance of safety on our roads\".The number of serious and fatal collisions in Bolton had \"massively reduced...but we've all got much more to do\", she added.\"One incident is one too many and they'll do nothing to bring back the four lives lost here today.\"Councillor Ayyub Patel, who represents the local ward of Rumworth, told BBC Radio Manchester that the victims' relatives were \"devastated\". \"The community was waking up to this very sad news, they are shocked - the mood is sombre.\"Any loss of life in any family is devastating news and to wake up to such tragic news is more so than expected.\"If it's expected, you know what's coming but if it's not expected, then obviously it's a shocking experience.\"Related links",

    "body": "11 hours agoGabriela PomeroyEPAOne person has died and 300 properties have been destroyed in bushfires that have torn across south-east Australia. The fires have raged in dozens of locations across the country for several days, mostly in the state of Victoria, but also in New South Wales, burning through land almost twice the size of Greater London.A state of emergency has been declared in Victoria as thousands of firefighters and more than 70 aircraft battle the blaze. Residents in more than a dozen communities have been advised to leave their homes.Authorities fear the fires, which are being fuelled by very hot, dry and windy conditions, could burn for several weeks.AAP/Michael Currie via REUTERSA forest burns in Longwood, Victoria, Australia on 9 January Victoria's Premier Jacinta Allan said 30 active fires were burning across the state, 10 of which were of particular concern. She said 350,000 hectares had been burnt across the state as of 08:00 local time on Sunday (23:00 GMT on Saturday). \"We will see fires continue for some time across the state and that is why we are not through the worst of this by a long way,\" she told Australian media. \"There are fires that are continuing right now that are threatening homes and property.\"Human remains were found in the village of Gobur, near the town of Longwood, some 110km (70 sq miles) north of the state capital Melbourne, police said. The victim has not yet been identified.Allan praised the emergency workers who worked to retrieve the body. \"This is difficult and confronting work, and it takes a heavy toll.\"\"The Gobur community is grieving,\" she said. Bushfire smoke is impacting air quality in many areas across Victoria, including metropolitan Melbourne. Authorities said the fires were the worst to hit the south-east of Australia since the 2019-2020 blazes that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people.ReutersFirefighter Tyrone Rice said losing his own home in the fire in Harcourt was \"a kick in the guts\"One of the worst-affected places is the small town of Harcourt in the central highlands of Victoria, where firefighter Tyrone Rice lost his own home in the blaze. He was out fighting one of the bushfires when he learned it was on fire. He told Australian media it was \"like a kick in the guts, but I'm not the first person to go through it, and I won't be the last\".The destruction in Harcourt was \"gut-wrenching\", local fire captain Andrew Wilson said. A reporter for Australia's 9 News, Jack Ward, told the BBC World Service he had visited the damage in several towns across eastern Australia. What he saw was \"catastrophic\", he said, and in many places, \"all that's left of these houses is a tin roof lying on the ground\".While it is hard to link individual wildfires to climate change as how humans manage the land can play a factor, scientists say climate change is making the hot, dry weather conditions conducive to bush fires more common.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKaya BlackNorth WestWolves of WiltshireThe three wolfdogs have been named Little Timmy, Boo and BrookeThree large dogs found roaming the streets of a Lancashire town the day before Halloween have been confirmed to be wolf-dogs after a rescue centre tested their DNA.The dogs were found abandoned in Preston on 30 October 2025, and their wolf-like features sent them viral, despite Preston City Council identifying them as a German Shepherd-type breed.Siblings Little Timmy, Boo and Brooke were taken in by a rescue centre and then transferred to specialists at Wolves of Wiltshire, who confirmed they were, in fact, of the wolf-dog variety. Oli Barrington, a trustee at the exotic animal charity, said the dogs, who were found emaciated, were now \"comfortable, safe and recovering from the ordeal\".Lancashire PoliceThe animals appeared emaciated when they were collected by Lancashire PoliceThe council said they had been told by their kennelling contractor that the dogs were \"a German Shepherd type\".A council spokesman said the dogs were only in the authority's care for a \"short statutory period\".\"We do not carry out DNA testing, so we relied on the description provided at that time,\" he added.Millions of people have watched videos about the dogs and their subsequent DNA test results on Tik Tok and other social media platforms.Mr Barrington said at Wolves of Wiltshire, the focus was \"on the animals themselves, their welfare, and their happiness\".He said the rescue centre was not planning to rehabilitate the animals or make them into pets.\"They will be whatever they want to be here,\" he said. \"If they want a life with minimal human contact, then that's what they'll have.\"What is a wolf-dog? A wolf-dog is a domestic breed of dog that has been bred with a wolf.In the UK, they are legal to own as long as they are three generations away from the original parent wolf, according to the PDSA.First and second generation wolf-dogs that have one direct wolf parent require a licence to own and are classed as exotic animals. Mr Barrington said Wolves of Wiltshire have specific licences that allow them to care for the animals, because they were an \"unknown quantity, and they could have potentially required a dangerous animals licence\".Little Timmy, Brooke and Boo's DNA tests, provided by company Embark, came back as 49.1% Gray Wolf and 50.9% Czechoslovakian Vlcak.The tests were ordered by 8 Below Husky Rescue, a rescue centre that first took the animals from the council. The wolf-dogs are learning from an adult female of the same breed at the rescue centreMr Barrington said he thought the law was \"a bit of a problem\", because it was about the number of generations away from a wolf, rather than the percentage of wolf DNA.He said the problem was irresponsible breeders were breeding high DNA content animals that were \"perfectly legal on paper\".\"There are very few people out there who could actually provide a decent home for a high content wolf-dog,\" he said. \"You really have to give up your life.\"An RSPCA spokesperson said: \"They are large, much more challenging animals who need highly experienced handlers who have not only worked with dogs, but also wolves, and fully understand their needs.\"They also said they did not make suitable family pets and people should be aware of the potential legal restrictions on keeping wolf-dog hybrids.However, many in the wolf-dog community are confident they can provide these animals with the care they need.HandoutLaura Mackenzie-Hawkins owns four wolf-dogs and one rescued Belgian MalinoisLaura Mackenzie-Hawkins, from Greater Manchester, has four wolf-dogs and one Belgian Malinois, which she said she had rescued from a young couple living in a second-floor flat.She took early retirement and said she was with the dogs \"24/7\" in her home, which has a large garden and 6ft-high (1.82m) fences added as adaptations for the animals.\"Just like with any dog, your responsibility is to keep that dog safe,\" she said.\"With the look of the wolf - as we've seen with the Preston three - if you get one wandering, you get mass hysteria.\"She said the wolf-dog community spent a lot of time educating people on the needs of the animals to try to ensure they ended up in safe homes.\"They're not easy,\" she added.More on this story",

    "body": "Thousands of tourists have been stranded in Finland's Lapland as a severe cold spell has grounded flights out of one of its airports.Departures from Lapland's Kittila airport that would have ferried winter travellers back to places like London, Bristol, Manchester, Paris and Amsterdam were all cancelled on Sunday as temperatures did not go above -35C on Sunday.The issue is expected to continue on Monday as a low of -39C is forecast by Finland's meteorological agency. The first flight out of Kittila has already been cancelled.The extreme cold makes it hard to de-ice planes, while maintenance and refuelling equipment on the ground can freeze.Airport operator Finavia told public broadcaster Yle that moisture in the air was making the situation worse as it was creating slippery frost.While Lapland - which spans northern Norway, Sweden and Finland - is known for the cold and snow, Finnish Lapland usually has a winter average temperature of -14C, with occasional dips to -30C, according to the nation's tourism board.Kittila airport predominantly serves people wishing to travel to nearby ski resorts and to see the Northern Lights, while Rovaniemi airport further south is the \"official\" destination for visitors to Santa Claus's folkloric home.One flight was cancelled out of Rovaniemi on Sunday.Flights were reportedly cancelled in and out of Kittila on Friday and Saturday as well.The cold weather has also made the roads particularly hazardous, with Fintraffic warning of icy conditions in the region.A bus full of Ukrainian passengers drove into a ditch on Sunday morning, Yle reported, citing local police. It said no serious injuries were reported.The unusual cold in Lapland comes as a storm passing over northern Europe has brought wintry conditions and travel disruption to the UK, France and Germany.A man was killed after a tree fell on his caravan in England, while around 100,000 homes were without power in France on Saturday.",

    "body": "Reigning champion Shaun Murphy and current UK title holder Mark Selby were both eliminated on a thrilling opening day of the Masters at London's Alexandra Palace.Murphy lost 6-2 to China's Wu Yize in the first round, before Selby, who won the UK Championship last month, was defeated by the same score against another Chinese debutant, Xiao Guodong.Murphy lost the opening three frames and, despite taking frame four, then lost the fifth on a black-ball finish.Wu, 22, is ranked 13th in the world and picked up his first ranking title in November when he won the International Championship in Yanjing in his home country, beating world champions Judd Trump, Zhao Xintong and John Higgins along the way.On his Alexandra Palace debut, Wu made a superb clearance of 137 in frame two and a break of 56 in frame seven.\"I felt a bit of pressure when I entered the stadium because it was the first time I've played in such a big stadium and the fans were so enthusiastic,\" said Wu.\"After the first frame, I felt a bit more relaxed and I totally enjoyed the atmosphere. It's definitely a great achievement for myself - my first time playing at the Masters and the first time beating Shaun Murphy.\"For 43-year-old Murphy, who reached the semi-final of the UK Championship last month, it was a disappointing afternoon with him failing to register a single break of 50.\"I've been looking forward to today for a year, walking out as champion, but I enjoyed the first 10 minutes,\" said Murphy, who beat Kyren Wilson to win the Triple Crown event for a second time a year ago.\"I'm very disappointed. None of it was there. I felt everything I touched was not there. I've been working very hard, practising hard, playing a lot of snooker, so I didn't expect to play like that and I'm as shocked as anyone.\"I didn't play well, certainly the worst performance of my season, maybe the worst in the Masters.\"Wu looked calm, looked at ease and fully deserved his win. He will be a handful for anyone he plays.\" Wu will now face a quarter-final on Thursday against compatriot Xiao, who played superbly to defeat three-time champion Selby in the evening session.Xiao, 36, made breaks of 95, 62, 76 and 77 as he won the opening four frames, with Selby's highest break only being 21.But the four-time world champion threatened a superb comeback as he made breaks of 101 and 76 to bring it back to 2-4.Xiao had not potted a ball in 46 minutes but then made an excellent break of 118 to move one frame away from victory, which he clinched by edging a scrappy eighth frame.\"The venue is good, the people watching are good and everything is perfect - this was my first time playing in the Masters,\" said Xiao.\"We both played good and I won the first four frames and gave Mark a bit of pressure but then he came back so it was a good game.\"Nobody thought I could win. I just told myself 'enjoy, be more relaxed and not think about winning or losing'. A lot of people were supporting me and that gives me confidence.\"Selby, 42, had no complaints about the result and said: \"In the first four frames I didn't have many chances. Every time Xiao came to the table, I made it easy for him.\"I did well to make it 4-2 and felt I had some momentum, then I missed and Xiao punished my mistakes.\"I feel good about my game even though I lost so it's just one to forget.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduAFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration has said it will send \"hundreds more\" federal officers to Minneapolis, days after the death of a woman who was shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in the city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that \"hundreds more\" will be sent to the area \"in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely\".Protests against immigration enforcement have been held in cities across the US after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in her car on Wednesday. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence. Local officials insist the woman posed no danger.Noem said the officers will arrive \"today and tomorrow\" and warned action would be taken if people tried to obstruct their work. \"If they conduct violent activities against law enforcement, if they impede our operations, that's a crime, and we will hold them accountable to those consequences,\" she said. Protesters gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday, with anti-ICE protests also taking place elsewhere in the US, including in Austin, Seattle, New York and Los Angeles.Minneapolis police estimated \"tens of thousands of people\" attended the \"ICE out of Minnesota\" rally and march, which started in Powderhorn Park on Saturday.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the protest was \"peaceful\".Police said 31 people had been arrested after protests on Friday and Saturday. Minnesota has already seen a surge of federal law enforcement officials as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement in the state.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesFederal law enforcement agents have been on patrol in MinneapolisSpeaking to CNN, Noem also doubled down on her assessment that Good was committing an act of \"domestic terrorism\", saying she had \"weaponised\" her car\" to attack ICE agents.In response to her comments, Frey told CNN: \"Anybody can see that this victim is not a domestic terrorist\", and he said her actions were of someone trying to do a three-point turn to escape the scene.The Minneapolis mayor added that the city's local law enforcement were \"outnumbered by the number of ICE agents and beyond\".On Sunday, Minnesota senator Tina Smith, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of trying to cover up the shooting.\"I think what we are seeing here is the federal government, Kristi Noem, Vice President Vance, Donald Trump, attempting to cover up what happened here,\" Smith told ABC News. \"I don't think that people here and around the country are believing it,\" she added. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Smith of lying, saying: \"Tina's lies only serve to further inflame tensions and incite violence against law enforcement officers.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAnti-ICE protesters also gathered in New York City on SundayVideos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and telling the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents at the front of the car points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street.Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours.The officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car.The FBI has said it will investigate the shooting.On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open their own inquiry after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation. Previously, US Vice-President JD Vance said the investigation is a federal issue.",

    "body": "9 hours agoZac SherrattSouth EastEddie MitchellOne of the two water station in East Grinstead, where people have been queueing to collect suppliesTens of thousands of homes in the south-east of England are still without water, with many told supplies will not be restored until at least Tuesday.In Sussex, some 16,500 households in East Grinstead have no or low pressure supplies, with people in Eastbourne and the village of Upper Dicker experiencing similar problems.In Kent, about 4,500 homes in the Hollingbourne, Headcorn, Ulcombe, Kingswood and Sutton Vallance areas have been left with no water, while those in Wrotham, Sevenoaks and the Loose area of Maidstone have low pressure or no supplies.South East Water (SEW) has apologised to all those affected and said it was delivering water to those on its priority register.The supply problems have been caused by a number of issues across SEW's network.The company blamed Storm Goretti and cold weather for the outages in East Grinstead and \"essential network changes\" for those in Eastbourne.It said the issues in Hollingbourne were due to \"neighbouring water companies being unable to give us the bulk supplies of treated water as they normally do\".A number of bottled water stations have been set up around the region but residents say it is causing chaos on the roads.Eddie MitchellLong queues of vehicles are causing traffic problems in and around East GrinsteadA woman from Forest Row, two miles south of East Grinstead, told the BBC: \"Most of the village is currently without water and yet we have to travel to East Grinstead to collect bottled supplies.\"The roads around East Grinstead are gridlocked with people queuing for water. Why aren't there water stations in the villages around East Grinstead that are without water?\"South East Water says it has delivered water to the elderly and vulnerable and indeed my sister, aged 72, had water delivered to her. However, her 92-year-old neighbour received nothing.\"How are the elderly and those without cars expected to travel to East Grinstead to get water?\"She added: \"Two water collection points is obviously woefully insufficient.\"The BBC put these comments to SEW, which said it had taken action following criticism.Mims Davies, the Conservative MP for East Grinstead and Uckfield, said she felt \"extremely sorry and frustrated for vulnerable customers, those with livestock, young children and babies, along with all the businesses which are deeply affected\".She described the ongoing situation as \"the worst case scenario\". 'Entirely unacceptable'Steve Andrews, incident manager at SEW, said: \"We have listened to customer feedback regarding yesterday's bottled water station at Sainsbury's, Brooklands Way, and we have taken the decision not to open this today, with an alternative bottled water station opened at East Grinstead Sports Club. We apologise for the disruption caused to the local community.\"The other bottled water station in East Grinstead is at the Queensway car park.In Kent, water stations are at Tunbridge Wells rugby club and Headcorn Aerodrome in Ashford.The village of Stelling Minnis, near Canterbury, is also experiencing supply issues, while thousands in Tunbridge Wells who have been without water since Tuesday should see it return on Sunday, SEW said.Eddie MitchellMembers of the public have been picking up bottled water at East Grinstead rugby club's water stationMary Creagh, a minister for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said on Saturday the problems were \"unacceptable\".\"I remain very concerned that people in several areas in the South East and South West are experiencing water supply issues following both cold weather and Storm Goretti,\" she said.\"This is entirely unacceptable. This afternoon, I chaired a further meeting with the water companies and local resilience forums to restore supplies as quickly as possible, prioritising vulnerable customers and essential public services.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "15 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentBBCWhen Jane Kingsbury, 80, last had her eyes tested, she says her optician told her that her eyesight was OK. But Jane, from Cambridge, says she is giving up driving at night because the feeling of being \"dazzled\" by other vehicles has left her feeling unsafe. \"I am worried about the glare from oncoming lights,\" she says.And when Jane mentioned this at a discussion group she attends, others felt the same. \"Over 90% of us did not want to drive in the dark,\" says Jane. \"So we have changed the time of our meetings from 7.30pm to 1.30pm [for much of the year] so that we can drive home before dark.\"Jane and her friends aren't alone. In a debate at Westminster last October, MPs voiced widespread concerns about bright headlights. Some described social isolation among constituents who had become too scared to drive in the dark.The RAC motoring organisation, which has campaigned on headlight dazzle, has repeatedly asked its members for their views. Most recently, more than half of respondents to a survey of 1,745 UK drivers in January this year felt the problem had worsened in the past 12 months. A third of those who said they were affected by dazzle said they felt less safe when driving at night.Getty ImagesHeadlight glare is an issue for all road users - not just motoristsIt's not only older drivers who feel this way. Emily McGuire from Essex told the BBC: \"I am in my 30s and sometimes I can't tell if [other vehicles'] main beam is on or off and once they have passed, I can't see properly for a good few minutes, it's terrible.\"She owns a smaller car and feels that she can't avoid the lights on higher, bigger cars: \"I suffer with migraines when a car approaches me with extremely bright lights, I have to look down or in the other direction… I also have to slow right down when it's really dark and I'm on a country lane.\"And experts say the problem is getting worse. Denise Voon, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists - which also campaigns on the issue - says: \"I am a practising optometrist and I've noticed that maybe 15 years ago, you rarely had people coming in complaining about headlight glare. But now it's becoming more and more prevalent.\"It's an issue that has even reached the United Nations - it will mandate all new cars to automatically adjust their headlight levels.But this will only affect new cars. And so the questions many are asking are: what, if anything, can be done about all the cars currently out there causing headlight discomfort - and why did nobody spot that this might be a problem?The impact of changing headlightsExperts believe a number of factors can cause headlight dazzle.One is the angle of headlights. If misaligned, they are more likely to cause glare. Misalignment can cause a vehicle to fail its MoT test.Then there's the fact that headlights have got brighter, to help drivers see better.Headlights have moved a long way from the \"kind of brown glow\" produced by filament bulbs decades ago, according to Dale Harrow, professor of Intelligent Mobility and Car Design at the Royal College of Art in London. They have become more complex and \"a design object in their own right,\" he says.Glass casings have given way to plastic and significantly, the light source has changed too, with most people now using LEDs instead of halogen bulbs, he says - the quality has improved and lights are now \"brighter, but also a lot clearer\".Getty ImagesCar headlights have come a long way since the heyday of the Jaguar E TypeWhile this \"has to be a good thing\" when it comes to helping the driver see clearly, Harrow says, it has also resulted in \"unplanned drawbacks\" - including dazzling other road users.Another problem is the illegal retrofitting of LED bulbs, especially when fitted into units designed for halogen. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has said it has stepped up a crackdown on retrofit bulbs, with sellers facing potential fines of up to £1,000.\"Recent advances in headlight technology have improved visibility but all headlights – whether LED or not – must still be aimed correctly and checked at the MOT test,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).How bright lights affect our eyesOur eyes adapt in the dark to become a lot more sensitive to light, says Denise Voon. As a result, being suddenly hit by very bright lights can temporarily make it very hard to see, even causing pain.Retinal cells at the back of the eyes which detect the light can get bleached, and take a while to recover. That's when people notice an imprint remaining in their vision after looking away.Although headlight glare does affect younger people, age is thought to be a factor. Older people are more prone to conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, for example.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThere is widespread concern that glare is getting worse - but the statistics are unclearVoon says there are a number of reasons why LEDs may be particularly problematic. Firstly, they are two to three times as bright as traditional halogens, and their \"colour temperature\" is bluer and whiter, which mimics natural daylight.Also, LED lights \"are a lot more directional, so you've got this much brighter, whiter light in a very directional point hitting your eye compared to the more diffuse halogen ones\".It's not clear if it is the brightness, colour, temperature or the direction of the lights - or some combination of all of these - that causes most problems, she says: \"But what we know is that's one of the differences.\"What the data says - and doesn'tDespite widespread concerns that the problem is getting worse, there isn't evidence that brighter lights are causing more accidents.Statistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that headlight dazzle was recorded as a contributory factor in 216 collisions in 2023. Four of those collisions were fatal.Although the overall number of collisions rose very slightly compared to the previous year, it was far below the 330 recorded in 2014. The figure was also lower than any of the intervening years except 2020, when the pandemic meant fewer drivers on the roads.But the fact that since 2024 \"vision affected by dazzling headlights\" is no longer listed in the DfT's published statistics as a contributory factor in its own right, makes comparisons or identification of a trend harder.Equally, these statistics don't tell us whether some people are choosing not to drive at night and nor do they account for other changes in driver behaviour.Still, a government-commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published last year, found that drivers \"perceived glare from vehicle headlamps to be an important and widespread issue when driving at night\".It also concluded that headlamps were perceived as \"too bright\", and that \"whiter\" headlamps and those on larger vehicles were \"generally perceived to be especially problematic for causing glare\".So far so obvious, you may think, based on what campaigners have been saying for some time. But the study went further.Researchers took out a car at night, rigged with equipment to measure light intensity and an observer in the vehicle could press a button if they felt glare might interfere with their driving.The study drew a link between higher levels of luminance - meaning the intensity of light - and the likelihood of experiencing glare. It also suggested that 40,000 candela per sq m - a measure of luminance - may be an \"important threshold for the experience of glare being more likely\".Also, when the research car was travelling uphill or around a right-hand bend, glare was more likely, researchers said - a driver's eyes are more likely to fall within the \"throw\" of headlamps from oncoming vehicles.Echoing the concerns of experts, researchers also found \"some tentative indication that larger body shapes such as SUVs and models with light-emitting diode (LED) headlamps may be more likely to be associated with glare\". However, further research was recommended in this area.The government has since agreed to conduct such further research. But this has not started yet, and it's unlikely to begin for at least a couple of months.An unidentified problemBut all this raises the question of why nobody anticipated widespread complaints about glare - in spite of all the research and development work that's been carried out by carmakers around the world. \"It seems more priority has been put on giving drivers the best possible view of the road at night and less on the consequences for oncoming traffic,\" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy.Manufacturers reject this. \"Safety is every car maker's top priority and providing good visibility to drivers in darkened conditions is essential,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \"All headlights must meet international standards so drivers can see as clearly as possible but without dazzling other drivers.\"In October, I had the opportunity to speak to Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo's Car Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. He explained how vehicles have to meet the standards of countries in which the manufacturer wants to sell them - vehicle manufacturing being an international business.LightRocket via Getty ImagesVolvo says avoiding glare is part of its design processThere are regulations around the headlights themselves, he says, covering their shape, intensity and glare. Also, headlights are tested on the road by different authorities and \"as a global car company, we need to comply with all of them\".Broberg said it was a \"concern\" that people are complaining about glare, but insisted that avoiding glare was part of the design process. He also pushed back against the suggestion that SUVs end up dazzling people more. \"The angle of the light is actually regulated,\" he says. \"So if you have a higher vehicle, then you need to have a lower [beam] angle.\"He argues that road geometry, and poor aiming of headlights in cars that don't have automatic levelling systems, are more likely culprits.What is already being done?In theory, technological innovations should help, particularly auto-dimming - although not everyone finds that they dip early enough.Off the back of the TRL report, the government has promised to look further into design factors that may be contributing to glare. The idea would be to use the findings to propose changes to international regulations at the United Nations.The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has a World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Following an agreement by this forum, new vehicles are meant to have mandatory automatic headlight levelling by September 2027. The effect of this technology is to correct the aim of headlights if the vehicle's load changes.But this would not change the headlight settings on the millions of cars on our roads already.More from InDepthThe TRL report also points out that \"many instances of glare are likely to remain even with stronger regulation\", because real-world situations of \"road geometry\" - the shape of the road, with ups, downs and corners - are not realistically under DfT's control.There are some basic things drivers can do to reduce the impact bright lights have on them. For example, keep their windscreen clean, inside and out.The College of Optometrists reminds motorists to always wear glasses if they have them, and make sure they are clean. It also advises staying up to date with vision tests, which can also pick up problems with eye health.More practical advice when confronted with bright oncoming headlights is to briefly look to the side of the road, keeping your eyes open - and of course, be considerate of other drivers when you're behind the wheel yourself.For Emily and others affected by glare, this guidance will have to make do for the time being. She says: \"It's tough but we cope and carry on until something is done about it.\"BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "43 minutes agoThe Daily Telegraph leads with Donald Trump's change in stance after a fresh attack on the Chagos Islands deal. The US President has demanded Sir Keir \"not give away\" Diego Garcia to Mauritius and added the military base was crucial for possible airstrikes on Iran, the paper reports. Trump accusing Sir Keir of surrendering to \"wokeism\" is the focus of the Times, as the president pulls US support from the Chagos Islands deal. It is the latest in a series of reversals from Trump, who \"appeared to give his blessing\" to the deal only weeks ago. The US State Department had also given its support on Tuesday.Former military leaders and ex-ministers have warned Britain faces a \"1936 moment\" and that Sir Keir must commit to \"doubling defence spending\", the Daily Mail reports. It describes the intervention by the group as \"unprecedented\" - with a demand that defence spending increase to 5% of GDP. The Financial Times leads with the expected early departure of the European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. According to someone familiar with Lagarde's thinking, Europe's top central banker wants to leave her eight-year term as president \"before the French presidential election in April next year\". Epstein \"trafficking\" allegations are the focus of the i Paper, as Surrey Police urge people to come forward with any information. The paper says Met Police are looking into \"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's former bodyguards\" and what they \"may have witnessed while protecting him during his friendship with the convicted paedophile\". The former prince has always strenuously denied any offence.Tony Martin, the farmer who shot dead a teenager intruder at his home in 1999, has left his entire \"£2.5m fortune\" to a \"pub landlady, the Daily Mirror says. Martin, who died aged 80 last year, has gifted his estate to \"pal Jacqui Wadsley, 52, who ran his local\" pub and \"helped him after his release from prison\", the paper says. In an exclusive, a grooming gang survivor has told the Daily Express her request to meet with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been ignored. Ellie Reynolds, 25, has accused the PM \"for breaking trust and allegedly ignoring their claims of 'corruption'\" over the UK's grooming gangs inquiry, which is expected to begin later in the year. A Home Office spokesperson has previously said the inquiry would have \"full powers to compel evidence and hold local investigations\".The government could block tech giants from the UK if \"revenge porn\" and deepfake sexual abuse images are not deleted from the internet within 48 hours, the Guardian reports. Sir Keir has said the government must confront this \"national emergency\". The Metro features a drill rapper on the run who managed to escape custody twice in a week and released a rap video apparently teasing police online. Daniel Boakye, 21, who goes by the rap name DSAVV, escaped Lewisham Hospital in south-east London on Sunday after being taken there for medical treatment. The rapper had been jailed for six years in 2023 \"for stealing phones at knifepoint to get passcodes\".  The song posted online features the lyrics: \"I just broke out of jail.\" A top think tank has called on Rachel Reeves to stop the \"dysfunctional\" policymaking causing Britain's economy to weaken, the Independent reports. The Institute for Fiscal Studies drew comparisons to Reeves' \"self-imposed rules on debt\" to a driver only focused on the speedometer \"while ignoring ... whether or not the brakes are working\", the paper says. The Daily Star's lead headline \"If you could turn Beck time?\" concerns Brooklyn Beckham removing a tattoo tribute to his father, David. The paper claims the former football star's son has kept a \"£220k watch ... his dad bought him for his 21st\". And pubs across the UK are celebrating an \"extra-time victory\" after minister agree to allow them to \"stay open until 01:00 or 02:00 for any home nation matches beyond the group stages\" for World Cup games this summer, the Sun reports.

    "body": "9 hours agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of racking up charges of more than €20,000 during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "Do not give away Diego Garcia, Trump tells UK in fresh attack on Chagos deal3 hours agoJaroslav LukivGettyThe US had previously supported the UK's decision to proceed with the Chagos deal\"Do not give away Diego Garcia,\" US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK's plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.Trump said \"this land should not be taken away from the UK\" and if it did it would be \"a blight on our Great Ally\", in a post on social media. In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was \"crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe\".\"The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,\" it said in a statement.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.Trump's latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: \"I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease...\"The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was \"strategically located in the Indian Ocean\".\"Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,\" he said. \"We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.\"And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran's controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: \"Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia... in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.\"The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities. The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Asked by the BBC about Trump's latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \"The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it's coming straight from the horse's mouth.\"When you see it on Truth Social you know it's directly from President Trump, that's the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration's policies.\"Watch: BBC asks White House about Trump U-turn on Chagos Islands dealIn a statement, it said it \"supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago\".Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump's latest comments was \"an utter humiliation\" for Starmer.\"It's time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.\"Trump's endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer's approach is doomed to fail,\" Davey wrote in a post on X.\"Britain can't rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It's time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.\"In response to the US president's latest post, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage - an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan - praised Trump's criticism of London's handling of the issue.\"Keir Starmer risks alienating our most important ally by giving away the Chagos Islands, the worst deal in British history,\" he wrote on X. \"President Trump is right to say the Prime Minister is making a big mistake. Starmer must cancel this deal.\"Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders - who are opposing the handover deal - landed on the Chagos Islands' remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.The Chagos Islands – officially known as the British Indian Ocean Territory – are located about 5,799 miles (9,332km) south-east of the UK and about 1,250 miles north-east of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean.The islands have been under British control since 1814 and were bought by the government for £3m, which led to the establishment of the islands as an overseas territory in 1965.But Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the islands away as part of a deal to gain independence.In the late 1960s, Britain invited the US to build a military base on Diego Garcia, forcibly removing thousands of people from their homes in the process.Some of those Chagossians ended up in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others settled in the UK, mostly in Crawley, West Sussex.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesUS billionaire Les Wexner, who is alleged to have played a key role in helping Jeffrey Epstein build his wealth, has said he was \"naive, foolish and gullible\" for trusting the late sex offender.In a statement to US lawmakers, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret lingerie brand accused Epstein of stealing \"vast sums\" of money from his family when working as his financial adviser.Wexner, who was testifying to a congressional panel as part of its Epstein probe, has denied any wrongdoing. Lawmakers accused him of knowing about Epstein's crimes, and failing to stop them.He was described as a potential co-conspirator of Epstein's in a 2019 FBI document, but no charges were ever brought against him.Wexner was called before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about his relationship with Epstein in the wake of the release of thousands of documents related to the financier's wrongdoing.Members of the committee travelled to Ohio, the retail mogul's home state, for the testimony. Only Democratic lawmakers attended the deposition. No Republican lawmakers travelled for it, though some of their staff members did attend.\"We should be very clear that there would be no Epstein island, there'd be no Epstein plane, there'd be no money to traffic women and girls,\" congressman Robert Garcia, of California, said. \"Mr Epstein would not be the wealthy man he was without the support of Les Wexner.\"Watch: Watch: Democrats say Les Wexner provided \"financial support\" to Epstein following depositionWexner, in his opening statement, defended those mentions by saying his relationship with Epstein was limited, and denied any knowledge of the convicted sex offender's abuse.\"I was naive, foolish and gullible to put any trust in Jeffrey Epstein,\" he said. \"He was a conman. And while I was conned, I have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide.\"He said he was \"pleased to testify\" and wanted \"to set the record straight\". Wexner also said he had visited Epstein's private island for \"a few hours\" with his family.The pair's relationship dates back to the 1980s and Wexner has said he cut ties after Epstein was accused of sexually abusing children in Florida.Wexner said he later discovered Epstein \"had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\", a statement he repeated in his opening remarks.The retail magnate was identified in a 2019 FBI document as a potential co-conspirator. A separate email also said there was \"limited evidence regarding his involvement\".Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche previously said Wexner's name \"appears in the files thousands of times\".Wexner's lawyers recently told the BBC: \"The Assistant US Attorney told Mr Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Mr Wexner was being viewed as source of information about Epstein and was not a target in any respect.\"Mr Wexner co-operated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoAdam EleyBBC NewsGetty ImagesA Supreme Court ruling is likely to lead to significantly higher damages being awarded to children injured by medical negligence.Until now, children have only been entitled to compensation for lost earnings – pay missed out on by not being able to work – for the years they are expected to live.But the court, ruling on the case of a child who sustained a brain injury at birth, found that compensation should take into account the full working life she would have had if she had not been harmed at birth.The decision could have large cost implications for the NHS. Its clinical negligence liabilities currently stand at £60bn, with two-thirds relating to maternity injuries.The child at the centre of this case, born in 2015 at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is not being named.During labour, monitoring indicated that her heartbeat was abnormal, but this was not acted on.She was born with signs of oxygen deprivation, required resuscitation and later scans confirmed a severe hypoxic brain injury.The Trust admitted failures in her care. The girl has severe cerebral palsy, is unable to walk or talk, has severe visual impairment and epilepsy, and requires continuous 24-hour care.In 2023, the High Court awarded a lump sum of £6,866,615 and an additional payment of £394,940 per year, linked to inflation. This was to cover the cost of her care needs and for loss of earnings up to the age of 29, her life expectancy.Wednesday's Supreme Court verdict, by a majority, has ruled that compensation should take into account her entire loss of earnings and pension for a full working life.It said that the Trust and the family's lawyers were agreed that had the girl not been injured, she would have enjoyed a normal life expectancy, obtained GCSEs, worked until aged 68 and received a pension.The additional damages will now be decided on at a later date - lawyers for the family claim it amounts to more than £800,000.Family 'elated'The girl's mother said in a statement that she felt \"elated that my little girl has changed the law and that this will help lots of other children who have been injured through no fault of their own\". The ruling brings the law in cases involving children into line with adolescents and adults that have suffered life-shortening injuries, who were already able to claim for 'lost years'.The court found there was \"no basis in law\" for injured children to have their claims treated differently.Around 250 cases of brain injuries in childbirth are reported to the NHS in England annually.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the NHS must do more to resolve cases through mediation.\"Very often... what people who have been wronged by the NHS want is a simple explanation and an apology, and their cases considered properly by the complaints procedure,\" he said.When cases instead end up in court, he added, they can take years, be stressful for families and lead to significant legal fees for the NHS - money which would be better spent providing care.The NHS must also \"seriously learn lessons,\" Sir Geoffrey said, to reduce instances of clinical negligence happening in the first place, which cause \"devastation\" for a child and their family.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Eight of the nine missing skiers located deceased, officials sayRescue teams combing through the backcountry of California's Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.The search for a final missing skier continues but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts \"challenging emotionally\". Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a \"football-field\" sized avalanche came barreling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 PST (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.Watch: California hit by heavy snow as avalanche leaves skiers missing\"I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,\" Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can't yet be recovered due to \"pretty horrific\" conditions, officials said.Since the avalanche, another 3ft (.9m) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.\"The hazard remains high,\" he said.Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.Officials say the victims are seven women and two men.Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse \"extreme weather conditions\" using specialised equipment.At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and \"could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche\", Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour. The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office said in a post on X that state authorities were \"co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort\" with local emergency teams.Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as \"treacherous\".\"Avoid the back country,\" he said. \"Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.\" The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a destructive potential scale of D1 to D5, according to the Sierra Avalanche Center, which would mean it was over half a mile in length and would have a deposit of around 6.5ft (2 metres). The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in (76cm) of snowfall since Tuesday.The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.",

    "body": "'I don't pay attention': Cynthia Erivo ignores online criticism as Dracula gets mixed reviews15 hours agoYasmin RufoNoël Coward Theatre, LondonDaniel BoudAfter years defying gravity, Wicked star Cynthia Erivo has traded the shimmering world of Oz for something darker and far more demanding. On the stage at London's Noël Coward Theatre, Erivo stands alone, carrying an entire gothic epic on her shoulders in a new adaptation of Dracula. There are no flying monkeys or emerald cities here. Instead, the actress alone carries a two-hour theatrical marathon, playing 23 characters with 20,000 words of dialogue in a constant dance with live technology that blurs the boundary between film and stage.During early preview performances, the show attracted attention for more than its ambition, as some audience members complained online that Erivo appeared to still be learning sections of the script and at moments relied on an autocue. But speaking after the show's opening night on Tuesday, the 39-year-old told the BBC she blocks out those comments. \"I'm not paying attention to any of them as no-one knows the experience except me,\" she said. \"It's not for me.\" \"I have a job to do and I want to do it as well as I can and I want to do it with all my heart. I don't let the comments take the energy that I should be spending on the stage.\" Daniel BoudErivo accepts that she was \"still learning my lines and figuring it out\" during the preview shows, adding that \"bit by bit it's become something that's a part of me, and everyone's learning process is different\". The production is stripped back and minimal. Erivo conjures the Victorian world  through voice and movement and her Dracula, delivered in a Nigerian accent and crowned with bright red hair, is only one of dozens of transformations. She slips between characters through rapid costume changes as several cameras film her live, projecting close-ups of her face onto a screen where the audience watches much of the action unfold.'I choose the challenges'Bram Stoker's 1897 novel about a Transylvanian vampire whose move to England unleashes terror, obsession and desire is one of the most frequently adapted works of fiction in history, with hundreds of stage and screen versions reinventing the vampire for new generations.Erivo said she hopes Stoker would like this adaptation and explained why she chose to take on the role. \"It challenges me and makes me learn in a different way so I am forced to grow as an artist,\" she said.\"If things were easy it would be boring so I choose the challenges.\" A stage performer at heart, Erivo made her West End debut in 2011 and has since become one of the few artists nominated for an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award, winning all but the Oscar.Daniel BoudAsked what it actually takes to prepare for a performance of that scale night after night, Erivo described a routine built on discipline and repetition.\"You have some good people who can help and it takes time and patience,\" she said. \"You find your way in and the through-line, and it becomes easier to learn.\" She added that before every show she meditates, has an extensive vocal warm-up and \"runs sections of the show\". Erivo is not the only Wicked star performing in the West End. Her former co-stars Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey are set to reunite for a London revival of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at the Barbican in 2027.Erivo tells BBC News she would not rule out sharing a stage with them in future. \"Maybe it's something I'd consider,\" she said. \"I'd never say no.\" Middling reviewsDracula has divided critics so far. \"From defying gravity to defying mortality – Cynthia Erivo gives an extraordinary, shape shifting performance,\" wrote the Standard's Nick Curtis in a four-star review.\"Her performance triumphantly walks a knife edge between virtuosity and absurdity.But many critics were far less positive. In a two-star review, Sam Marlowe of the Stage said that the show had \"sounded like such a toothsome prospect\", but that the result is \"bloodless\". \"What could possibly go wrong? Sadly, the answer is: almost everything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucks, but it certainly doesn't bite.\"Getty Images\"The story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue,\" she explained, \"which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations.\"\"Over a very long and testing two hours and five minutes – unrelieved by the mercy of an interval – [Erivo] gives an astonishing performance,\" he said.\"I didn't come here to watch a film about Dracula, I came here to watch a live show,\" he said. \"The production disassociates you with much of the feeling and heft of live performance.\"Olivia Garrett of the Radio Times agreed the show is \"let down by overproduction\" in a three-star review, adding: \"Like Dracula himself, this production sits stranded in the middle, not dead, not alive, but somewhere in between.\"\"The British actress proves any doubters wrong,\" he said in his four-star review. \"This isn't a flawless night but it's a tour de force even so.\"Additional reporting by Steven McIntosh.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesA shortage in medical cement is likely to lead to delays in some patients getting joint surgery, NHS bosses say.It comes after Heraeus Medical, the main supplier of bone cement to the health service, has had to temporarily halt production at its main site affecting supply for up to two months.The German firm supplies about three-quarters of the bone cement needed in the NHS. The product is used in more than 1,000 operations a week, mostly in knee replacements, but also in some hip and shoulder replacements.Hospitals are being told to prioritise emergency patients ahead of those on the waiting list.These are likely to be older patients who have suffered falls and those with broken hips.Currently there are 850,000 patients on the waiting list in England requiring planned treatment to their joints – the largest of any speciality.Guidance from NHS England calls on hospitals to focus on providing care to those in the most pain or with the most complex conditions.Hospitals have about two weeks supply of bone cement in stock.NHS England and counterparts in the rest of the UK are seeking to increase supplies from four other manufacturers that supply the NHS.Patients are being told to assume their appointments and treatments will go-ahead,  unless they are told otherwise.'Crushing blow'Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Arthritis UK, said: \"This is a crushing blow for those individuals who have finally made it to the front of the orthopaedic surgery queue after a long time waiting.\"We urge hospitals to communicate quickly with those affected to avoid additional worry and uncertainty.\"Aside from the personal toll on people with arthritis, the stakes are high for government who have an uphill challenge to bring down waiting lists to meet ambitious targets.\"In a letter to its customers, Heraeus Medical said it had experienced a critical machine failure at its main site when it was in the process of upgrading its production processes.A spokesman for the firm added: \"The wellbeing of our patients and the satisfaction of our customers are top priorities. We deeply regret that there are currently delivery delays affecting our medical bone cements.\"An NHS England spokesman said the problem was affecting supply globally.\"The NHS is issuing immediate guidance to hospitals to ensure trauma and urgent care can safely continue and to support prioritisation of waiting lists based on patients' needs over the coming weeks.\"Fergal Monsell, of the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA), which represents joint surgeons, said his organisation was working with NHS bosses to limit the impact on patients.He said it was likely hospitals would start using surgeons and theatres more to carry out operations that do not require bone cement.\"The BOA will update surgeons with developments so they can treat their patients as the situation develops,\" he added.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoRichard MorrisTechnology reporterGetty ImagesTech platforms would have to remove intimate images which have been shared without consent within 48 hours, under a proposed UK law.The government said tackling intimate image abuse should be treated with the same severity as child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and terrorist content.Failure to abide by the rules could result in companies being fined up to 10% of their global sales or have their services blocked in the UK.Janaya Walker, interim director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the \"welcome and powerful move... rightly places the responsibility on tech companies to act.\"The proposals are being made through an amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, which is making its way through the House of Lords.Under the plans, victims would only have to flag an image once, rather than contact different platforms separately. Tech companies would have to block the images from being re-uploaded once they have been taken down.The proposal would also provide guidance for internet service providers to be able to block access to sites hosting illegal content, the idea being that this would target rogue websites that currently fall outside of the reach of the Online Safety Act.Women, girls and LGBT people are disproportionately affected by Intimate Image Abuse (IIA).A government report in July 2025 found young men and boys were largely targeted for financial sexual extortion - sometimes referred to as \"sextortion\" - where a victim is asked to pay money to keep intimate images from being shared online.A Parliamentary report published in May 2025 highlighted an increase of 20.9% increase in reports of intimate image abuse in 2024.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the prime minister said the rule would mean a victim of intimate image abuse \"doesn't have to do a sort of whack-a-mole chasing wherever this image is next going up\".He noted that tech companies are \"already under that duty when it comes to terrorist material so it can be done. It's a known mechanism,\" adding that \"we need to pursue this with the same vigour.\"Sir Keir said the law would be enforced by fines and other measures yet to be determined. He said he did not think this would include prison sentences for tech bosses.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"The days of tech firms having a free pass are over... no woman should have to chase platform after platform, waiting days for an image to come down\". The announcement comes after the government's standoff with X in January, when AI tool Grok was used to generate images of real women wearing very little clothing.This eventually led to the function being removed for users.

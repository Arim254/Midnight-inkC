    "body": "11 hours agoCachella SmithReutersRussell Brand has been charged with two further offences including one count of rape, the Metropolitan Police has said.In a new statement, the police force said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised an additional charge of rape and a charge of sexual assault relating to two further women. The broadcaster, comedian and actor previously pleaded not guilty to five charges including two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault in relation to four women.Mr Brand, 50, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2026 in relation to the two new charges.Detectives began investigating allegations into Mr Brand which came to light following reporting from the Sunday Times, the Times and Channel 4's Dispatches in September 2023.The two new charges allegedly took place in 2009 and relate to separate women, the CPS said.A trial is set to start at Southwark Crown Court on 16 June 2026 for the five original charges which allegedly took place on dates spanning between 1999 and 2005 in central London and Bournemouth.Mr Brand, of Oxfordshire, is accused of raping one woman in Bournemouth in 1999, and indecently assaulting another in the Westminster area by grabbing her arm and dragging her towards a male toilet in 2001.A third charge alleges he sexually assaulted a woman by kissing and groping her in Westminster between 2004 and 2005, while the remaining counts relate to the alleged oral rape and sexual assault of an additional woman in 2004 in the Westminster area. Det Ch Insp Tariq Farooqi from the Metropolitan Police has said the women who have made reports are receiving support from specially trained officers.Mr Brand, who was born in Essex, rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and became a household name as host of TV shows like Big Brother's Big Mouth, and with his own radio programmes on stations including BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music.He went on to establish a Hollywood career, starring in films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek.",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons. And how a lost radio play by Tennessee Williams was found more than four decades after his death, and has now been heard for the first time.\nThe Global News Podcast brings you the breaking news you need to hear, as it happens.

    "body": "4 hours agoMany of the papers lead with the latest tranche of the Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice, which includes an email exchange between Ghislaine Maxwell and a person signing off as 'A' writing from the \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\". The Daily Mirror says the author of the email asked Maxwell to \"find me some 'friends'\" who are described as \"inappropriate\", according to the paper. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's team for a response. The former prince has previously denied all wrongdoing.Under the headline \"Ghislaine Maxwell emails revealed\", the Sun says she allegedly sought to \"find fun girls for Andrew\".\"Andrew, 'fun girls' and 'inappropriate friends'\" is the i Paper's summary of the latest round of the Epstein files. The Guardian also leads with the \"girls\" email from the Epstein files, saying \"Andrew faces new pressure\". A photo shows climate activist Greta Thunberg being questioned by a police officer in London. The paper writes she was arrested \"after protesting in support of the Prisoners for Palestine hunger strike\".The government will \"scrap farm raid\" plans, the Daily Express writes. Labour will raise the \"tax threshold on inherited farmland\" from £1m to £2.5m, the paper says. It quotes farmer Jonathan Charlesworth – whose dad took his own life \"amid fears\" of the tax – saying the change was \"the best Christmas present for a lot of farmers\". A preview of King Charles III's Christmas message, which will be delivered from Westminster Abbey, also features on the front page.Labour's \"quiet Christmas U-turn\" on its inheritance tax plans is the Financial Times's take. \"Treasury to forgo £130mn\" in tax revenue as a consequence, the paper writes, as it \"shrinks [the] share of farmers facing inheritance tax to 15%\". The Times says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faced a \"revolt by Labour MPs\" over the initial £1m inheritance tax threshold proposal, writing \"Downing Street was warned that over 40 MPs were prepared to defy Starmer.\"The prime minister's \"U-turn on farm tax\" is described by the Daily Mail as a \"humiliating capitulation to his backbenchers\".\"Farmers cheer as Starmer U-turns on tractor tax raid\" reads the Independent's headline, which the paper says follows \"months of fierce protests – and financial anguish for many families\". \"Loathe actually\" is the Daily Star's headline spin on the popular Christmas film Love Actually, whose director Richard Curtis and his wife Emma Freud oppose \"the idea of a 30-pitch campsite in their swanky village\". Plans for the campsite were approved by East Sussex Council, which Mr Curtis \"objects to\", the paper says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterA judge has quashed a private prosecution brought by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) against comedian Reginald D Hunter, saying it was intended to get him \"cancelled\".The CAA's prosecution accused the US stand-up comic, 56, of sending offensive messages on three occasions in August and September 2024.On Tuesday, District Judge Michael Snow quashed a summons for Hunter, ruling that the CAA was seeking to use the criminal justice system for \"improper reasons\".\"The CAA have demonstrated by the misleading and partial way in which it summarised its application and its wilful, repeated, failure to meet its disclosure obligations, that its true and sole motive in seeking to prosecute Reginald Hunter is to have him cancelled,\" he wrote.\"I have no doubt that the prosecution is abusive,\" Judge Snow added at the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.\"My view of the conduct of the CAA is consistent with them as an organisation which is not 'playing it straight' but is seeking to use the criminal justice system, in this case for improper reasons.\"Hunter, who is known for his appearances on TV shows like Have I Got News For You and 8 Out of 10 Cats, wrote on Instagram \"I sure hope I'm employable again!\" and thanked his legal team.He was accused of sending an offensive communication on three occasions to Heidi Bachram on X on 24 August and 10 and 11 September last year.However, the judge said the CAA's application for a private prosecution had been \"wholly inadequate\" when it came to disclosing her social media activity towards him.\"It did not reveal the extent of her tweets directed against Reginald Hunter in the period immediately preceding the complaints (her tweets were sent between 15 August and 11 September 2024),\" he said.\"The summary misled me into believing that his comments were addressed to her involvement with the Jewish faith as opposed to his response to attempts that were being made to have him 'cancelled'.\"The judge added that the CAA had failed to inform him of a compliance investigation by the Charity Commission into the organisation in November 2024.Hunter's lawyer, Rebecca Chalkley KC, told a hearing on Tuesday: \"The CAA are weaponising and using the courts for their own political agenda and not just in this case.\"The CAA's prosecutor Donal Lawler told the hearing that the charity had complied with its duty of candour.In a statement, a CAA spokesperson said: \"We are of course deeply disappointed by the District Judge's decision.\"Our mission is, and always has been, to stand up for British Jews and their allies, particularly at a time when levels of antisemitism and antisemitic violence are rising at an alarming rate.\"Our lawyers are examining the ruling and considering our next steps.\"Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or CPS.",

    "body": "The Libyan army chief has been killed in an air crash in Turkey, Libya's prime minister has said.Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad and four others were on board a Falcon 50 aircraft flying out of the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Tuesday evening.  In a post on X, Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said signal with the business jet was lost at 20:52 local time (17:52 GMT) - about 42 minutes after it took off from Ankara's airport. The Tripoli-bound jet had issued an emergency landing request before contact was lost. The aircraft's wreckage was later found south-west of Ankara, and an investigation is now under way into what caused the crash.In a later post on X, Yerlikaya wrote that police had spotted the debris near the village of Kesikkavak, in the Haymana district.He said the \"public will be informed of further developments\".In Libya, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, the prime minister of the country's internationally-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU), said he had received news of the deaths of Gen Haddad and other senior Libyan military officials on board the jet.The prime minister called it a \"great loss\" for the nation, saying Libya had \"lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication\".Gen Haddad and his team had been in Turkey for talks aimed at further strengthening military and security co-operation between the two countries.Turkey has played an increasingly dominant role in Libya after intervening in 2019 to prevent an army from the east of the country driving out the internationally-recognised government in Tripoli, and has built close political, military and economic ties.",

    "body": "Christmas can be a nightmare for misophonia sufferers like me 4 hours agoElena BaileyHealth ReporterLottie DoyleOver the years, Lottie says she has found ways to try to better manage her misophoniaLottie is looking forward to spending time with her family this Christmas, but says one of the only ways she'll manage to get through it is by wearing her earplugs - especially during Christmas dinner.For the 23-year-old Christmas can be a particularly difficult time as the sounds of other people, chewing, slurping and sniffling make her feel extremely uncomfortable.\"I get this feeling of sudden panic, my whole body will just tense up and it feels like I'm in danger, and I need to somehow control these noises.\"Lottie has suffered from misophonia since she was 16 and for her that makes the festive season \"incredibly overwhelming\".Misophonia is a reduced tolerance to certain sounds, particularly those made by other people.It's surprisingly common in the UK. In 2023, researchers from King's College London and University of Oxford found almost one in five people suffer from it.Often it's sounds associated with mouth, throat or facial movements that cause distress, as well as things like chewing, breathing, and repetitive finger tapping.'Anxiety inducing'Lottie says: \"There are so many different triggering sounds at Christmas and that can be anxiety inducing and make you dread it.\"My family are understanding, but I'm very conscious that I don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable. It's like a really big battle of sacrificing my own sanity to make sure everyone else is happy.\"So it's easy to understand why the most wonderful time of the year can quickly turn into a living nightmare for those with the condition.Sounds that may seem harmless or easy to ignore, like someone slurping a Buck's fizz, rustling a roll of wrapping paper, or tucking into a Christmas dinner can trigger a strong emotional response that can even lead to them avoiding social settings altogether.Jenna O'DonnellJenna is already thinking about coping mechanisms to get her through Christmas lunchJenna, a 21-year-old student, who has struggled with misophonia since aged 10, says currently her plan is to put her earphones in to get through dinner. On any other day, she would usually isolate herself in a different room to avoid triggering sounds.She says her misophonia is worse around people she's closest to, so Christmas is always \"challenging\".\"There's an expectation to spend time with family, and I want to, but it's physically and mentally challenging.\"It's like this uncontrollable anger comes over me which can feel embarrassing, or I'll feel anxious and immediately start crying and then fight-or-flight will kick in.\"It can come across as if I'm being difficult and dramatic, but it's hard to explain unless you've experienced it.\"Three ways to copeIf it's an issue you suffer from then there are some different techniques you can try to cope, according to clinical psychologist Dr Jane Gregory, who told the BBC's Morning Live Programme:Visualise something else: Imagination is key. Try to associate the particular sound affecting you with something completely different. So for example, try to imagine someone's slurping is just a sink draining water. By doing this you're trying to teach your brain that the sound affecting you isn't harmfulTry a competition: Have a bit of fun with it and make the irritating noise into a competition with the culprit. For instance, if someone is crunching loudly have a go at mimicking the sound and crunching loudly too. By mimicking, instead of feeling like the sound is being imposed on you, you become an active participant. And the competition element should help distract your brain into focusing on that and make you a little less affectedCreate a scenario: Another technique is to try to create a little story about why the person making the noise is having to make that sound. So if someone was sniffing for instance, perhaps they're not feeling well or maybe they're upset. By doing this you're changing the meaning of the sound. Although the noise stays the same, your interpretation of it shifts from being aggravating, to feeling a little more neutral towards itOther stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "3 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesJessica Gunning won a Bafta for her role in Baby Reindeer in May Baby Reindeer was one of the standout television moments of the past few years and it catapulted actress Jessica Gunning to stardom. She played the obsessive and troubled woman, Martha, who dramatically unravels onscreen. For Gunning it was the \"role of a lifetime\", describing life as a \"surreal\" but also a \"dream\" since the show's release. \"I got goose bumps when I first read the script,\" the British actress tells the BBC, adding she had five auditions for the role.But she thought the television series might have been an indie hit, not the phenomenon on Netflix it became.  Of course, a potential downside of starring in a show like that does mean you get stopped in the street and occasionally confused with your character. \"I'd just parked near where I live and a woman screamed in my face! But in her defence she had just finished the series, walked out of her home and there I was. \"So that's surreal, occasionally being screamed at,\" she says.\"But everyone has been so lovely, there's also an incredible statistic about the difference the show has made to charities, especially ones for male survivors of sexual assault. \"I think it shows people want complicated stories. I have had 14-year-olds come and talk to me about it, as well as 90-year-olds.\"Getty ImagesShe played the troubled character MarthaAnyone who has watched Baby Reindeer may tell you it can be a difficult and upsetting watch.The show says it was based on real-life events experienced by the show's creator, Richard Gadd, who also plays the lead character. But this is disputed by the woman who allegedly inspired the person Martha is based on, who has said Netflix told \"brutal lies\" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world.She said in June 2024 she was suing Netflix for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.The show is billed as \"a true story\", but a judge concluded in his ruling in September 2024 that certain key events in the series, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life.Netflix failed in its attempt to persuade the judge to throw out the legal case brought against it, but said: \"We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story.\"'It's all been a bit pinch me'Filming such an intense drama has given Gadd and Gunning a \"unique bond\" the actress says.\"We always checked in with each other and the producers and director made sure everything felt safe and considered.\"Baby Reindeer started life as a stage show at the Fringe at Edinburgh, Gunning had tried to see but couldn't get tickets so bought the play text instead.\"That was a little bit Martha of me\" she laughs.Her persistence paid off, and Gunning swept up during award season, winning an Emmy, a Bafta, a Golden Globe, an RTS and a Screen Actors Guild award. \"It's all been a bit pinch me, for all of the cast and crew really, we were out in LA, which is just crazy anyway to be in Hollywood. All the clichés are true, even to be nominated is an honour.\"Sometimes I look at the shelf that has my awards on and I think 'Oh my gosh', it feels like a dream really.\"Gunning has been in the industry for almost two decades, but Baby Reindeer has been a life-changing experience.\"I feel like on the one hand my life has completely changed, but I also feel exactly the same in a good way.\"\"I feel like if something like Baby Reindeer happened straight after coming out of drama school, maybe I'd feel like a bit of a deer in the headlights, pardon the pun. \"Now I feel a lot more grounded and I've got a big group of family and friends. But it is kind of strange, the number of viewers that Netflix bring in, you can't really compute. If you think about it too much it can feel a little bit scary.\"She is well aware of the significance of the role saying: \"I waited 17 years for a part like Martha to come along, so hopefully it won't be another 17 years.\"Getty ImagesJessica Gunning and her Baby Reindeer co-star Richard GaddGunning will next be on-screen on Christmas Eve, in the BBC One and Children In Need animation Pudsey and the Thread of Hope. It is based on an original story by McFly star and composer for the Paddington muscial Tom Fletcher, who's also written the music for the cartoon. Gunning plays a woman grieving for her husband, while her son is also navigating his way through grief. It is a handbrake turn after Baby Reindeer, but Gunning says the script was \"beautiful\" and she wanted to be involved \"in the special charity\". \"Children can deal with big issues like this, and hopefully children will watch and feel seen if they've experienced this, or are going through something similar.\" \"All my life I've grown up with Children In Need, I went to school dressed up as an Emu and wore it all day.\" Jessica Gunning took Pudsey Bear into a recording studioSo what next for Gunning? She's starring alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield in a film adaptation of Enid Blyton's much-loved children's book, The Magic Faraway Tree, and is filming a comedy with Angelina Jolie. The actress who's from the West Yorkshire market town where enduring BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed jokes: \"It's Holmfirth to Hollywood.\" Pudsey and the Thread of Hope airs on 24 December at 10:20 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer, and on 27 December at 17:00 GMT on CBeebies and CBBC.",

    "body": "Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has been permitted to leave prison to undergo surgery on Christmas Day following approval from Brazil's Supreme Court, court documents show.Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year prison sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the last election in 2022.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday granted permission for Bolsonaro to temporarily leave prison and be transferred to a hospital on Wednesday for a hernia operation on 25 December.Bolsonaro, 70, has faced ongoing health complications since being stabbed in the abdomen during a 2018 presidential campaign.In April, the right-wing former president underwent intestinal surgery. By November, Justice Moraes, who also oversaw his trial, mandated that Bolsonaro be given full-time medical care. Flávio Bolsonaro, the former president's son, posted a video to X on Wednesday with the caption: \"Keep praying for the president.\"Bolsonaro was found guilty in September for plotting a coup d'etat after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.The former leader is serving his sentence in a federal police jail in Brasilia, the capital, after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention.Earlier this month, tens of thousands of people in Brazil's main cities gathered to protest against a bill trying to significantly reduce the time Bolsonaro spends in jail.Lawmakers passed the bill last week after it was approved by the lower house. Legal experts have estimated it could reduce Bolsonaro's sentence to less than three years.  In response, Brazil's president Lula promised to veto the bill.\"With all due respect to the Congress, when it reaches my desk, I will veto it,\" Lula told journalists last week, while acknowledging his veto could be overridden by the largely conservative Congress.US President Donald Trump, who had previously called the investigation into Bolsonaro a \"witch hunt\", welcomed the bill being passed. The US also lifted sanctions that had been placed on Justice Moraes in July.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaThe King will give the traditional message from the Abbey's Lady ChapelThis year's Christmas message from King Charles III will be delivered from Westminster Abbey.This traditional speech, filmed in the Lady Chapel of the medieval church in central London, follows his \"good news\" earlier this month about responding well to cancer treatment.The King is expected to talk about the \"pilgrimage\" of life, and the lessons it can teach about the issues of the day, in a message broadcast at 15.00 on Christmas Day.Last year the speech was given in the Fitzrovia Chapel, which once served hospital staff, and was a symbolic location for a message focusing on the King's thanks for health workers.PA MediaThe King was able to re-use the Christmas trees from Catherine's carol concertThis year's setting is below the Lady Chapel's famous medieval vaulted ceiling, in a chapel where 15 previous kings and queens are buried, including Elizabeth I, Mary I and Charles II.It also means that for a second year the Christmas message won't be delivered from behind a desk inside a palace.The King will be seen standing in front of Christmas trees which were brought to decorate the Abbey for the Princess of Wales's carol concert held earlier this month.Westminster Abbey was also the venue for the King's recent Advent service, where there were prayers and music from different Christian traditions, including Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox.There was a display of icons in the Abbey for that service - and when the King visited Pope Leo earlier this year he gave him an icon of St Edward the Confessor, a saint with strong connections to Westminster Abbey.The Advent service and the trip to the Vatican had reflected one of the King's longstanding causes - his efforts to build bridges between people of different faiths and backgrounds.The tradition of an annual Christmas broadcast from the monarch, looking back on the year and addressing current events, dates back to 1932, when George V delivered a speech on the radio.The first televised Christmas speech was delivered by Elizabeth II in 1957. It's usually among the most-watched programmes on Christmas Day.",

    "body": "The US State Department said it would deny visas to five people, including a former EU commissioner, for seeking to \"coerce\" American social media platforms into suppressing viewpoints they oppose.\"These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states - in each case targeting American speakers and American companies,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from making adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"Clare Melford, who leads the UK-based Global Disinformation Index (GDI), was also listed.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit that fights online hate and misinformation, was also handed a ban.Rogers called Mr Ahmed a \"key collaborator with the Biden Administration's effort to weaponize the government against US citizens\".The BBC has reached out to the CCDH for comment.Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression,\" they added.Rubio said that steps had been taken to impose visa restrictions on \"agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States\".\"President Trump has been clear that his America First foreign policy rejects violations of American sovereignty. Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception,\" he added.",

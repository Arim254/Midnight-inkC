    "body": "Guardiola, a great generation, and dogs called John and CharlesThe Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop on Saturdays across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:20 GMT on Saturday, 13 December (00:05 on Sunday, 14 December in Scotland).———————————————————No-one has played more games under Pep Guardiola than Bernardo Silva.Silva has been picked more than 400 times by Manchester City manager Guardiola, who signed the Portugal midfielder in 2017.They have won six Premier League titles together, while Silva has also won the Nations League title twice.Silva sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about what it is like to play under Guardiola, his standout matches, and his dream of winning the World Cup.Media caption, 'This club can turn things around' - Bernardo Silva believes Man City can get back to winning it allKelly Somers: Well, Bernardo, thank you for your time today. Let's start with why football? How did you end up in this sport?Bernardo Silva: It was an easy choice because it was always my passion. Since I remember, I always had the ball with me at home, even when my mum was a bit upset at my dad because I would break a few paintings or jars or whatever. I always had the ball with me and it was always my passion.Kelly: Did you have brothers and sisters as well? Was it a family thing?Bernardo: Two sisters. It was not a family thing. Obviously my dad is also a big football fan and he likes to play as well. And even my mum, she always went to football games, even though she's not from my club, she's from the rivals. So my dad's side of the family is from one team, my mum's the other side of the city.Kelly: So is your dad's team Benfica?Bernardo: Yeah, my dad's team Benfica, my mum's team Sporting.Kelly: That must have been controversial when you went to Benfica. What did she make of that? Bernardo: No, she was happy. Actually, it was also my grandfather's idea from my mum's side. He was a Sporting supporter. They were always very supportive. I played 12 years at Benfica. Nine years at City now, but at Benfica from when I was seven until I was 19. I'm a Benfica fan, but Benfica is the biggest club in Portugal. I would go to Benfica games with my dad. Since I was a little boy, it was always my dream to be there to play for that club so, yeah, I was really happy. And I was really lucky to get that opportunity of learning from the best coaches in Portugal, having the best facilities from that early age at Benfica.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bernardo Silva joined Benfica when he was sevenKelly: Who would you say has had the biggest influence on your career and the player you are today?Bernardo: It's difficult to say. I would say between Benfica and Man City for the time, because Monaco was three years - even though I was really happy there, it was only three years - Man City nine now. But I think it shaped me from when I was seven until 19. They gave me not only the football knowledge as a player, but also they shaped me a little bit as a man. They made me tougher and stronger. At Monaco, even though it was shorter, they gave me the opportunity to start at the higher level, and at Man City I achieved everything and more than I ever dreamed for. I always dreamt of winning the Premier League, but I never imagined myself winning six. So, you know, Man City gave me more than I hoped for as a young kid, honestly.Kelly: What about a team-mate or coach that shaped you particularly?Bernardo: Pep is obviously a very big influence for me in terms of managers. Players... when I arrived at Monaco, I was very lucky to have Joao Moutinho there - a Portuguese player that is, for me, one of the most intelligent players that's ever played for our country. So he also was a mentor for me and he was in a way also a manager because I learned a lot from him. He was a big influence, but at Man City also I had a lot of really good players that taught me a lot - from Vincent Kompany to David Silva to Fernandinho. Different types of players and you learn different types of things, but I definitely had a lot of different influences in football.Kelly: Did you hear what Pep said about you recently - that you're one of the best he's ever trained?Bernardo: Yeah, I saw that and I'm happy that he feels that way because the players that he manages are not bad players! I think I'm the player with the most games played under Pep, so obviously he has that special affection for me because it's been so long - but, as I said, the influence from Pep on me is massive. Nine years and I learned a lot.Kelly: Pep has an interesting relationship with his players. It always looks, as outsiders, when we see him on the pitch at the end you might have won 4-0 and then he goes up and he's really intensely talking to you. Have you been on the end of any of those?Bernardo: Yeah, a lot of times. Sometimes I see that people think that he's complaining to us, but it's just the way he moves his arms a lot and being very passionate, but at the end he's just talking about a small detail that he wants us to improve. Sometimes he's really frustrated as well, obviously, but most of the time he uses a lot of his arms so it looks more than it actually is.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Guardiola has picked Silva more than any other playerKelly: If there was one game from your career that you could relive, what would it be?Bernardo: Easy answer - Champions League final [2023, when City beat Inter Milan 1-0]. But even bad days for us... for example, if we talk about the game against Tottenham in the quarter-finals of the Champions League [2019] that we got knocked out, that was a fantastic game to be part of. So I have a lot of fantastic games, fantastic memories that I could choose.Kelly: What about the toughest moment?Bernardo: Well, Champions League final against Chelsea [2021] was a tough one when we lost 1-0, but I would say even more than the Champions League final, the one against Real Madrid in the semi-final [2022] when they scored two goals in the last two or three minutes. That one was tough to take because we were much better than them in both games for five minutes. You throw everything away. It was a very frustrating experience. At the end we got it, but the Champions League was a tough journey for us.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Silva started Manchester City's 2020-21 Champions League final defeat by ChelseaKelly: You mentioned there the word frustrating. Is that how you sum up parts of the last couple of years here at Manchester City?Bernardo: Well, yeah, we're trying to bring that culture back knowing that at this level it's not easy. I would love to tell you that what we did in my first seven years is something normal but it's not, because in seven years winning six Premier Leagues, winning a Treble, winning a domestic quadruple, doing 100 points, breaking the record of goals... obviously I'm a bit biased, but I could argue that that generation was the best ever in English football.So that is not normal, so you cannot expect that to last forever. Obviously, if you look at the Champions League final, for example, from that team, seven or eight players already left - very important players. You're talking about big names like Kevin de Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan, Manuel Akanji, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, Julian Alvarez, or Cole Palmer - he left, he wasn't playing much but he left - and he was a very good player. And there's a new generation coming that needs time to adapt. I've been through that process once and it went really well because when Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho, Sergio Aguero, David Silva left, the change was made a bit slowly because we were winning, so it's easier. When you're losing, it's more difficult to make that change, and you put more pressure on the young guys. I still believe that this club and these players have a lot of potential, a little bit of time and patience.I know it's tough in football at this level, but I really think that this club can turn things around and go back. I don't know to the standards that were, because that's not easy, it's the reality, but hopefully... I will try to help them as much as possible for them in the future to be in a good place to fight for that.Kelly: How much would it mean, then, given all you've just said if you were to lift silverware this season? Bernardo: Well that's the aim. It would mean a lot because at this club it is not acceptable not to win. If you don't win, the club will make decisions again and it's normal. It's part of the business, and that's the way it is - that's good.  If you want to play for Man City, you need to win. If you don't win, you don't deserve to be here. So that pressure that's on us, it's a good one and we take it. Kelly: Do you think you're in a position to win silverware this season compared to where you were last season? Bernardo: I think we're in a much, much better position. You cannot compare. If you said to me last season, with no injuries, last season was a very, very good squad. But with all the injuries that we had, and with all the problems that we had, I would say that right now we're much more prepared to fight for titles.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Silva has won 14 major trophies with Manchester CityKelly: I want to take you back to a young Bernardo. What were you like as a child?Bernardo: I was very energetic. I liked to believe that I was a very happy kid and with a lot of passion to try and succeed in life.Kelly: What was your earliest non-football memory?Bernardo: Fighting with my older sister... is that a good one?!Kelly: You have two sisters. Are they into football? Do they come and watch or is it quite nice to talk to them about it differently? Bernardo: I still believe that nowadays they have no clue what an offside is, but they support me! Wherever I am, they support me - I know that.Kelly: Who's your best friend in football?Bernardo: Ruben Dias. Ruben is three years younger than me. So I remember him from the Benfica academy, but he wasn't a friend back then. I've known Ruben really well on a daily basis for five and a half years now.Kelly: How do you escape from football? Bernardo: Well, my daughter and my wife help a lot, so when I get home and I see them, even when I lose, I forget about things. And I love doing stuff with them. I love going on trips with them or to watch a film at home. Whatever it is, I love to spend time with them. My daughter is two and a half years old almost. When I [have a day] off football, she takes all my time and energy.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Silva has won 107 caps for Portugal since his debut in 2015Kelly: What's your ideal day off?Bernardo: Depends on where I am. If I was in Portugal, I would go to the beach, I would go to the pool, I would chill. Here in Manchester, when it's too cold, it's difficult. But on a normal day, I would say get my two dogs, go walk them, go with my wife, go to like a park or something and enjoy a bit of fresh air with them.Kelly: What are your dogs' names?Bernardo: John and Charles. John is named, you know, after John Stones a long time ago. I got Charles from Wales. At that time, Prince Charles from Wales. So I thought Charles. I wanted an English name as well, because I had John already. So I chose Charles as well.Kelly: Tell me one thing about yourself that would surprise me.Bernardo: I think that I'm really good at football and I always dedicated my life to that. I actually have no clue what I would do if I wasn't a football player. I never had the chance to explore hidden talents because I dedicated my life to football. Kelly: My next question was going to be: 'If I wasn't a footballer I would be…'Bernardo: I don't know. It's a very difficult question. I would love to know, because when I finish football, if I don't want to stay in the game, I want to do something. I don't want to stop, so that's a very good question. I'm still going to try to find that out when I finish my career. Kelly: I had a chat with your Portugal head coach, Roberto Martinez, recently, and he actually said: 'When Bernardo finishes playing, he will be a manager.' Is he right? Bernardo: I don't know. I think I could. I think I have a really good understanding of the game. I don't know, because I dedicated so long and so much time of my life to this. When I finish my career, I want to spend time with my kids or travel with my wife or who knows... I love football. I think I'm going to miss it. I'm not sure. But if I miss it and I come back, probably it's going to be to be as a manager.Kelly: You've got a bit of time to decide. You've got a few more years in you, haven't you? Bernardo: A few more years, yeah.Kelly: What's the best bit of advice you've ever been given? Bernardo: I would say that I know it's a bit of a cliche, but don't be afraid of failing. You know, like, go for it. If you fail, it's all right. Also to have fun. When you enjoy what you do, you do it better. Kelly: If you could achieve only one more thing in your career, what would it be? Bernardo: That's an easy one. I need a World Cup. It would be the biggest achievement of my life because Portugal has never done that. It's the only trophy that Portugal, our country, has never won, so I would love to do that.",

The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Sir Keir Starmer has urged resident doctors not to go ahead with \"reckless\" strikes planned for next week, saying it is \"beyond belief\" they could take place during a flu outbreak.The prime minister said the NHS is in its \"most precarious moment\" since the coronavirus pandemic due to soaring flu cases across the UK, and that strikes would put the healthcare system and its patients in \"grave danger\".The doctors' union, the British Medical Association (BMA), is polling its members to see if they are willing to call off the walkout, with the results to be released on Monday.But if they vote against it, a five-day strike by resident doctors will begin two days later on Wednesday 17 December. A BMA spokesperson said the government could stop the strike by tackling pay, conditions and trust with a credible offer.Flu has come early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating, say experts. Many are now calling it \"super flu\", but it is not more severe nor harder to treat.An average of 2,660 patients per day were in hospital with flu in England last week – the highest for this time of year since records began in 2021, and up 55% on the week before, NHS England said.Flu cases are also rising in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, figures show. Children and young people are particularly affected by the outbreak, health officials said.Writing in the Guardian, Sir Keir said the strikes \"should not happen\" and said resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, should accept a deal to avert industrial action.Sir Keir said as well as the government's new offer, they had also given the BMA the chance to reschedule the strikes until after Christmas. \"Don't get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled... But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the NHS,\" he said.The BMA said it will ask its members whether the government's offer will be enough to call off Wednesday's strikes.If members indicate yes, then they will be given time to consider the offer in more detail and a formal follow-up referendum would be held on ending the dispute completely.The offer aims to address problems for some doctors trying to find work and to provide more training places for newly qualified medics to progress in their careers.Health Secretary Wes Streeting made a similar intervention to Sir Keir's on Friday, warning strikes coupled with increasing flu patients would be a \"double whammy\" for the NHS.However, the medical director for the NHS in London, Chris Streather, said the flu situation was \"well within the boundaries\" of what the NHS could cope with and that hospitals were better prepared for large disease outbreaks since the Covid pandemic.

    "body": "From booze to black belts: Virginia's drunk raccoon suspected in karate shop break-inA raccoon that broke into a Virginia store and joyfully drank its way through the liquor aisle is now suspected of a wider crime spree, officials say.A Hanover animal control officer suspects the stripe-tailed mammal also broke into a nearby karate studio and then raided the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for snacks.\"Supposedly, this is the third break-in he's had,\" said Officer Samantha Martin.The raccoon, now nicknamed the \"trashed panda\", was first discovered passed out in the bathroom of the Ashland liquor store two days after Thanksgiving. After sobering up, the unlikely outlaw was released back into the wild.A new study found the masked mammals known for rummaging rubbish bins for easy food, are evolving and getting comfortable around humans.Ms Martin says it's only a matter of time before the masked bandit strikes the shopping centre again.\"This is not the first time he's been in one of the buildings,\" she told the county government's official podcast, Hear in Hanover, on Thursday. \"He was in the karate studio. I think he got into the DMV [and] ate some of their snacks one time,\" she said. She later added that there is a chance the earlier break-ins could have been perpetrated by a different raccoon - but officials have identified him as their prime suspect.Raccoons are known for breaking into peoples garbage cans, leading to the nickname \"trash panda\".The county has been selling shirts with the logo \"trashed panda\" and has raised a whopping $207,000 (£155,000) as of Friday. The money will be used to renovate the shelter, and add to its capacity, Ms Martin said. Officials say the little Kung Fu trash panda was living his best life when he was detained in the liquor store and kept his spirits up even after being placed in the county kennel. \"I just set him in there, [and] let him kinda relax for a few hours. The sun was beating on him so he was feeling good,\" Ms Martin said, adding that he was released about one mile away from the shopping complex. \"He didn't do anything wrong. He was just having a good time.\" The story has gone viral, which Ms Martin says is because it is so \"relatable\".\"Everybody's been there,\" she says. \"Everybody's had a few extra and passed out by the toilet, and hopes somebody can come get you the next morning.\"\"I hope he learned his lesson,\" she said, before adding that there's a good chance he might be found committing another heist soon. \"He'll be back. He's not a dummy.\" ",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 11 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peak into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

Two men were arrested after an appeal by Peterlee Neighbourhood Police Team. Police said officers were in the process of charging and remanding a 26-year-old man with criminal damage, while a 23-year-old man has been released under investigation.Durham PoliceThe tree had been in the village for more than 10 years On Friday, Shotton Residents Association chairman Steve Maitland said the tree had been put up as a monument to the fallen soldiers of World War One.He told BBC Radio Tees that members of the public were making a sleeve for the tree's base, so they could bolt it back up as quickly as possible, \"just to tide us over for Christmas\".He said: \"These people who did this – I don't think they understand the history and the feeling of these things.\"Some of the people involved in fundraising for the tree a decade ago had since died, he said.He called the attack \"mindless vandalism\" but said he could not \"turn the clock back\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "17 hours agoHelen CattPolitical correspondentThe government says it has \"no current plans\" to force drivers who run over a cat to report the collision.Nearly 11,000 people have signed an e-petition submitted to Parliament calling for the government \"to make it law that if you hit a cat you must legally report it and take it to the nearest vets\".Cats and wild animals are not covered by the Road Traffic Act 1988, which states drivers must stop and report an accident which involves certain specified animals such as dogs, horses, cattle, mules, sheep, pigs or goats.A government statement said that prosecutions would be difficult due to the small size of cats and their tendency to be \"most active at dawn or dusk\".The government understands \"how upsetting it is when a much-loved pet is killed on our roads\", the statement read, adding the UK is \"a compassionate country\" and the lack of a legal obligation to report animals deaths and injuries should not stop drivers from trying to find the owner of pets, including cats.However, it added: \"In many cases drivers may not be aware they've hit them - particularly with larger vehicles. Because of that, it would be difficult to prosecute drivers if the law was changed.\"The statement also said the exclusion of cats was because the original law was brought in due to dogs and other animals being \"working animals\" rather than to protect domestic pets.The campaign group Cats Matter has lobbied successive governments to try to make it illegal for drivers to leave the scene of a collision with a cat in the UK.Co-founder Mandy Hobbis said the group was \"very disappointed\" with the government's response to the petition.\"We struggle to understand how we can call ourselves a compassionate country when our laws allow drivers to hit cats when driving and legally leave them on the road suffering.\"Cats are much loved family members, just like dogs are, and they deserve the right to be helped if struck by a car, just like dogs are\"She said the group had worked with the previous government on a law that introduced mandatory micro-chipping in June 2024 and was grateful for the progress made so far but urged ministers to go further.A report by  Cats Protection in 2021 found that road traffic accidents were a cause of injury for 4% of cats.The charity encourages any driver who injures a cat to take the animal to a vet for emergency treatment.\"This gives the cat their best chance of survival and means owners can be contacted and informed quickly,\" said Madison Rogers, the charity's associate director of advocacy, campaigns and external affairs.She said she would urge drivers who are involved in a road traffic collision in which a cat dies to contact their council.\"We'd also encourage local councils to scan any cats they collect so their owners can be informed, as it's heartbreaking for owners to not know the fate of a lost or missing cat,\" she added.Parliamentary e-petitions which reach 10,000 signatures receive a response from the government. They are debated in Parliament if they reach 100,000 signatures.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "3 days agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterToffee Crisp and Blue Riband bars can no longer be called chocolate after maker Nestle changed their recipes.To be described as milk chocolate in the UK a product needs to have at least 20% cocoa solids and 20% milk solids, a level each product fell below once a higher amount of cheaper vegetable fat was used.Nestle said its reformulations were needed due to higher input costs but were \"carefully developed and sensory tested\" and there were no plans to alter the recipes of other chocolate products.As many ingredient costs, such as cocoa and butter, increased food companies have altered recipes to use less of the expensive ingredients, as well as shrinking serving sizes.Nestle now describes the treats as being \"encased in a smooth milk chocolate flavour coating\" rather than being covered in milk chocolate.A spokesperson for Nestle said the food giant had seen \"significant increases in the cost of cocoa over the past years, making it much more expensive to manufacture our products. We continue to be more efficient and absorb increasing costs where possible\".The change to the bars' ingredients was first reported by The Grocer.Nestle is not alone in recent reformulations. In October, McVitie's Penguin and Club bars switched to be labelled as as \"chocolate flavour\" because the amount of cocoa they contain has been reduced after parent company Pladis chose to use cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.Although cocoa commodity prices have recently eased slightly, a surge in costs over the past three years, driven by poor harvests and droughts, has pushed up the cost of chocolate.Changing ingredient proportions in food and drink manufacturing due to cost is sometimes called \"skimpflation\". It has become more common in recent years as inflation has increased producers' costs.Supermarkets were found in 2024 to have reduced the amount of costlier ingredients such as beef and chicken in their ready meals.",

    "body": "How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up3 days agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.However, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "10 hours agoBrandon DrenonHouse Oversight CommitteeUS President Donald Trump was among several prominent figures featured in the images released on Friday Democratic US lawmakers have released two new batches of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing details of the convicted paedophile's home and ties to the rich and powerful.US President Donald Trump, former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon are among the high-profile figures featured in the photos. The images, many of which have been seen before, do not imply wrongdoing.The nearly 100 photos released by members of the House Oversight Committee on Friday are some of more than 95,000 images obtained via subpoena, the Democrats said.The justice department is separately approaching a deadline next week to publish all Epstein-related documents.Watch: Massie and Garcia on latest photos from Epstein estateIn the first batch of photos released on Friday by lawmakers, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available.A third photo showed Trump smiling with several women, whose faces have also been redacted, flanked on either side of him.An additional photo showed an illustrated likeness of the president on red packets next to a sign that reads: \"Trump Condom\".The White House called the release a \"Democrat hoax\" against Trump that has been \"repeatedly debunked\". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.House Oversight CommitteeHouse Oversight CommitteeFriday's files also include private images of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with several other prominent people including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates.One photo featuring Clinton shows him standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating the disgraced financier's abuse.Two other people the BBC has yet to identify are also in the image, which appeared to have been signed by Clinton.Clinton has denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. In 2019, a spokesperson said he \"knows nothing about the terrible crimes\" Epstein pleaded guilty to.One image included in Friday's batch was a cropped section of a picture originally taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, which showed King Charles in conversation with Microsoft founder Gates at a London summit.The image contained in Epstein's collection was cropped to show only Andrew and Gates.Andrew, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein, was stripped of his \"prince\" title and left his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, earlier this year. He has denied any wrongdoing.House Oversight CommitteeThe cropped section of the image, showing Bill Gates and Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorGetty ImagesThe original image, taken by a photographer working for Getty ImagesFormer Trump adviser Steve Bannon is also seen in some of the images. In one, he is shown speaking with Epstein at a desk, and in another, standing beside him in front of a mirror.A third image shows him speaking with filmmaker Woody Allen.Other prominent figures who appear in the images include US economist Larry Summers, lawyer Alan Dershowitz and entrepreneur Richard Branson. Not all the images show those individuals in the company of Epstein.No additional context or details were included, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom, including images from what appear to be Epstein's estate in the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls, a scene which featured in a previous release of Epstein files.There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: \"Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.\"House Oversight CommitteeRepublicans, who are in the majority on the House Oversight Committee, have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump\".In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,\" he added.House Oversight CommitteeEpstein's connection to multiple high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and demands for greater transparency around the investigations into the billionaire financier.Following months of pressure from across the political spectrum, the justice department has until 19 December to release all documents related to the Epstein case as required by a bill passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by Trump in November.That upcoming deadline is separate from the congressional investigation into the Epstein case.Friday's publications mark the second time in a month that Democrats on the committee have published new images from its inquiry into Epstein.They originally released 19 images on Friday morning before publishing another nearly 80 later in the day, saying in a statement: \"In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate.\"House Oversight CommitteeTrump was asked about the new photos on Friday evening and told reporters that a lot of people knew and were photographed with Epstein, calling the release \"no big deal\".Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s, but according to the president, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also previously said that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for \"being a creep\".Watch: \"I know nothing about it\", says Trump on recent Epstein photos released",

    "body": "12 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesCrack open a tub of Celebrations or pull a Terry's Chocolate Orange from a stocking these days, and have you noticed, there seems to be a little less to go around?Not only that, you might find – no, it is not your imagination – that some popular treats taste a little different, a little less \"chocolatey\".To top it all the prices have risen too.So will your festive favourites still hit the sweet spot this Christmas?Chocs awayMany of the companies making popular bars and chocolates admit they have been looking for ways to save money. A tried-and-tested one is to replace some of the more expensive ingredients, like cocoa, with cheaper ones, a strategy that's been dubbed \"skimpflation\".Some recipes have changed so much that bars like Toffee Crisp, Penguin and others can no longer be called chocolate.There is even a debate among some chocolate fans over whether the year-round classic Cadbury's Dairy Milk has changed its recipe.Becca Amy Stock, a TikTok influencer who goes by the name Becca Eats Everything, set herself the task of reviewing every milk chocolate bar at Britain's major supermarkets. The 29-year-old spent six hours and £100 on her rigorous research.She concluded Dairy Milk was \"more oily\" since Cadbury's takeover by the American company Mondelez in 2010. And the brand, famous for its \"glass and a half\" of milk, was less milky, she said.\"You do notice the difference,\" Becca says, \"Cadbury's does not taste how it used to taste.\"Becca Amy StockMilk chocolate in the UK must have at least 20% cocoa solids and 20% milk solids to earn the name chocolate. Without that it has to be labelled \"chocolate flavour\" not chocolate. Cadbury's Dairy Milk still meets that standard.Mondelez says it has not been fiddling with the recipe, at least not recently.\"Our Cadbury Dairy Milk products continue to be made with the same delicious recipes that consumers know and love,\" its spokesperson said. \"The cocoa content has not changed for many years.\"Crunching the numbersBut it is still one which you'll be paying more for.Plenty of food manufacturers have been reducing the size of their products, without dropping prices, known as shrinkflation.And some are also putting prices up, too.Chocolate prices in supermarkets have risen by more than 18% on average from this time last year, according to market researchers Kantar.We got these figures by analysing price data collected by market researchers Assosia across four of the UK's biggest grocers, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, between December 2021 and December 2025.They show:Cadbury's Dairy Milk weighs 10% less, while the cost jumped from £1.86 to £2.75 - a 48% price increaseMars Celebrations has shrunk by 23%. The price has risen from £4.25 to £6.11 - a 44% jumpTerry's Chocolate Orange is 8% smaller, while the cost has risen from £1.49 to £2.25 - a 51% price riseGetty ImagesMondelez's spokesperson said putting up prices was a \"last resort\" but ingredients are costing more - in particular cocoa and dairy.\"This means our products continue to be much more expensive to make.\"As a result of this difficult environment, we have had to make the decision to slightly reduce the weight and increase the list price of some of our Cadbury products,\" they said.Mars Wrigley told the BBC higher cocoa prices and manufacturing costs meant they had to \"adjust some… product sizes... without compromising on quality or taste.\"Sticky costsSo what has caused the price of cocoa and milk to shoot up?Extreme weather caused by climate change has hit cocoa farmers' crop yields in Africa, says Ghadafi Razak, an academic at Warwick Business School.Extreme rainfall in India, Brazil and Thailand in 2023, followed by droughts the following year have meant poor harvests in those countries too, pushing up prices.The extra costs take time to feed through to customers, says Christian Jaccarini, a senior food analyst at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, which means those extra costs are hitting shop shelves now.\"It takes about 18 months for the impact of a shock to be felt by consumers, so we still have quite a long time with higher prices for chocolate,\" he said.Milk prices have shot up too. Diarmaid Mac Colgáin, founder of the Concept Dairy consultancy blames the rising cost of feed, fuel and fertilisers as well as farmers facing higher wage bills and production costs.He says some brands have substituted palm oil and shea oil for some of the milk to make up the fat content of their chocolate.Bad tasteShoppers are becoming increasingly aware of these cost-saving tactics, but that does not mean they are happy about it.It is the element of unwanted surprise that can leave a bad taste, according to Reena Sewraz, retail editor at consumer champion, Which?It can feel \"especially sneaky\" when companies shrink products or downgrade their ingredients she said.\"With Christmas not far away, shoppers will be looking to get the best value from what they buy,\" she said. \"Supermarkets and manufacturers should be more upfront about making these changes. Customers may not love the news - but [then] at least they don't feel misled.\"AlamyBut there is not much you can do about it. For Becca, who insists she's not \"chocolated out\" despite her chocolate-tasting marathon, quality not quantity is the way to go.She suggests fellow chocoholics treat themselves to smaller premium bars such as Tony's Chocolonely. They'll cost more but she finds them more satisfying.She also plans to treat herself to a selection-box on Christmas day.Otherwise she generally advises against \"food snobbery\".\"I think supermarket own-brands are actually a much better way to get better quality chocolate.\"More weekend picks",

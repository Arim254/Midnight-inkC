    "body": "12 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterAn unnamed star from Strictly Come Dancing has been arrested on suspicion of rape.Hertfordshire Police said the man, who was arrested last month, had been released on bail under investigation.A BBC spokesperson told BBC News: \"It would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing police investigation.\"According to the Sun, the man is alleged to have raped a woman after a BBC event. The newspaper says the woman was not a contestant or professional dancer on the show, but had met the man due to his participation in the competition.It is understood the development is not related to the current series of Strictly.In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said: \"A man was released on police bail under investigation having been arrested in London on Monday 13 October on suspicion of rape.\"The police force said the allegations related to an incident which happened in Hertfordshire.\"Meanwhile inquiries by officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Public Protection team will continue.\"Given the nature of the allegations, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.\"It comes after another man involved with the hit BBC dance show was also arrested on suspicion of rape in August.The Metropolitan Police said the man was also suspected of \"non-consensual intimate image abuse\".It is not known what role that individual had in the programme.Strictly, which has aired since 2004 and is predominantly filmed at Elstree Studios, has faced multiple controversies over the past few years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests.Last year saw the show hit the headlines over separate allegations facing two professional dancers.Giovanni Pernice denied suggestions of abusive or threatening behaviour during rehearsals after allegations from his dance partner Amanda Abbington, and subsequently left the show.Graziano Di Parma's spokesperson admitted the dancer had kicked his 2023 dance partner Zara McDermott once during rehearsals, which he called a \"mistake\", and for which the dancer apologised. He also left the show.Separately, the BBC launched an investigation earlier this year into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars, who have not been named.In August, the Met said it was investigating allegations of drug use on the hit dance show.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris Mason,Political editor and Becky Morton,Political reporterThe UK government is expected to approve China's plans for a new mega embassy in central London.A final decision has not yet been formally taken, but the advice ministers are understood to have received from the intelligence agencies clears the path for the controversial project to be given the go ahead.The expected green light – first reported by the Times newspaper – will become the latest case study in the growing public argument about how wise a close relationship with Beijing is.The approval or rejection of the planning application lies with the Housing Secretary Steve Reed – in what is known as a quasi-judicial decision.But given the sensitivities of this judgement call, many others have been consulted – including MI5 and MI6.The decision has repeatedly been delayed and last month the government pushed back a deadline to rule on the application to 10 December.The site at Royal Mint Court is close to the City of London, and fibre optic cables that carry vast quantities of highly sensitive data, sparking concerns it could pose an espionage risk.The embassy, at 20,000 square metres, would be the biggest of its kind anywhere in Europe.Some have argued that a single site, rather than multiple sites across London, may be easier to manage and there is an awareness in government that rejecting China's long-standing desire for its new embassy could set back diplomatic relations.However, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel warned that approving the embassy would put Britain at risk, accusing Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"desperate and unprincipled\".The Chinese Embassy in the UK has previously said the new complex would enhance \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" between China and Britain, with officials arguing objections to the site are unjustified.Since winning the general election last year, Labour has sought to thaw the UK's relationship with Beijing.Chancellor Rachel Reeves, Business Secretary Peter Kyle and the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office, Sir Olly Robbins, have all been on visits to China.The prime minister is expected to make his own trip to the country, perhaps as soon as early next year.Asked about the prospect of heading there, he told reporters en route to the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa, that no visit was confirmed yet.He said the government's approach to China \"is the same approach as we've always taken, which is cooperate where we can and challenge where we must, particularly on national security\".Critics say the government is insufficiently hard-headed about what they see as the threat posed by Beijing, and argue for a much greater caution in the UK's relationship.Dame Priti said: \"It beggars belief that Starmer is jetting off to Beijing just months after the case against the alleged Chinese spies collapsed on his watch.\"She added: \"Keir Starmer is so weak, and our economy so precarious, that Labour feels it must kowtow to China at every opportunity, regardless of the cost to our country.\"In September a case involving two men - including a former parliamentary researcher - who were accused of spying for China collapsed in controversial circumstances. Both men denied wrongdoing.Prosecutors said the case was dropped because they could not get evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat.However, ministers insisted they were frustrated it collapsed and blamed the position of the previous Conservative government, as well as out-of-date national security legislation.Earlier this week MI5 issued an alert to MPs and peers, warning they faced a significant risk of spying from the Chinese state.The alert said individuals working on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security were posing as \"headhunters\" on platforms like LinkedIn and targeting people working in British politics to obtain insider information.China has rejected claims of espionage as \"pure fabrication\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent, in KyivUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to criticise or reject this US draft peace deal - even though it appears to heavily reflect many of Moscow's demands. On Thursday, the White House pushed back on claims Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged after meetings between the US and Russia.In his nightly address, Zelensky said Ukraine needed peace and would engage in diplomacy and issue no rash statements. He said Ukraine was \"ready for constructive, honest and efficient work\".But there is deep concern about some of the reported proposals, including giving up the entire Donbas region, reducing the size of Ukraine's military, and ruling out the presence of international troops in the country - concessions which Ukraine has rejected in the past.Ukrainian MP Yaroslav Yurchyshyn told the Kyiv Independent that Washington wanted a \"quick peace at the expense of one side, which they consider weaker\".Recent events may have further weakened Ukraine's position. Russia has made further advances in the east of the country. Moscow's long-range strikes on Ukraine's grid has left most of the country facing power cuts. Allegations of serious corruption in Ukraine's government have also led to political infighting and diverted attention from the war. All these issues are impossible to ignore in both Washington and Moscow.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that peace will require difficult decisions on both sides. A draft published in the media does include a promise of \"reliable security guarantees\" for Ukraine.It's believed to suggest some frozen Russian assets should be used to help rebuild Ukraine. While the draft rules out Ukraine's membership of the Nato military alliance, it keeps the door open for its membership of the European Union.Europe itself appears to have had little say over the drafting of this plan. There's no mention of the efforts led by the UK and France to provide an international reassurance force in Ukraine, should there be a ceasefire. The draft explicitly rules out the presence of foreign troops. Europe wants its voice heard. Pressure from European allies could still help Zelensky alter the draft proposals.But there may not be much time. US officials who presented the plan, approved by US President Donald Trump, are said to be working to an aggressive timetable - weeks, not months. They're expected to travel to Moscow soon. Any hopes of getting Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky in the same room to negotiate appears to have been abandoned.Trump, who's often claimed he can quickly end the war, seems to be running out of patience. He just wants the two sides to sign up to a deal.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterFormer cabinet minister Lord Michael Gove has apologised on behalf of the then-government and Conservative Party for \"mistakes made\" during the coronavirus pandemic.In her long-awaited report published, Baroness Hallett says Boris Johnson, the prime minister at the time, oversaw a \"toxic and chaotic\" culture in No 10 during Covid.Lord Gove told the BBC's Today programme some \"attitudes\" in Downing Street had been \"far from ideal\" but added that in a crisis \"the business of government can't be carried out in the manner of a Jane Austen novel\". He also said an earlier lockdown would have been \"wiser\" but questioned the report's assertion that it would have meant fewer deaths.Responding to the report, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would learn lessons from the report and was already \"taking measures to make sure that, not just the NHS but the government as a whole, is prepared for any number of eventualities\".The 800-page inquiry report is highly critical of government decision-making, and says implementing a Covid lockdown a week earlier could have saved 23,000 lives in the first wave in England - although it does not suggest that the overall death toll would have been reduced.It also says lockdowns could have been avoided if the government had introduced restrictions such as social distancing earlier and concludes lockdowns \"only became inevitable because of the acts and omissions of the four governments\" in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The report describes February 2020 as a \"lost month\" and says the government's lack of urgency was \"inexcusable\". It says there was a failure to learn lessons from the first Covid wave and that restrictions in autumn 2020 were introduced too slowly. At Christmas of the same year, the inquiry argues the governments failed to take action \"until infection levels were critical\".Johnson, who was prime minister between 2019 and 2022 and set up the inquiry, is accused in the report of failing to make decisions quickly enough in autumn 2020 - and of repeatedly changing his mind.He has been contacted for a comment.Lord Gove rejected a suggestion that the conclusions of the Covid report would put an end to any future political ambitions Johnson may have. He said Johnson's style of decision-making \"may not be to everyone's taste\" but added he was \"wrestling with an enormously difficult question about the curtailment of liberty and the maintenance of access to healthcare\".\"More than that, without his drive we would not have had his vaccine roll-out that ensured we were the first country to put jabs in arms.\"Dominic Cummings, a senior aide in Downing Street at the time, is singled out for criticism in the report which suggests he displayed \"destabilising behaviour\" and contributed to a \"culture of fear\" that \"poisoned the atmosphere\". It also said the loudest voices in government prevailed - and many were ignored \"to the detriment of good decision-making\".Cummings, who left No 10 at the end of 2020, accused the inquiry of enabling \"a vast rewriting of history\".He said it was \"important for the public to realise that on most of the big questions, the 'experts' including the senior scientists were completely wrong\" in the early months of 2020. Lord Gove said Cummings had been responsible for ensuring data was \"accurately and thoroughly interrogated\". He also said the report noted Cummings' interventions had been \"critical to putting in place the measures necessary to suppress the virus\". Asked about the culture in Downing Street, he said: \"It's the case that we were dealing with, as everyone in the world was, an unprecedented crisis... and of course, under pressure with imperfect information, mistakes are made, voices are raised.\"Rishi Sunak, who was chancellor during the pandemic, told BBC 5 Live's Matt Chorley that both the government and scientists had been \"operating in a highly uncertain environment\". \"I think we do need to view the decisions taken through that lens, but it's important that lessons are learned so that we can be better prepared if there's ever another pandemic.\"",

On Friday, Sir Keir said he had \"not directly spoken to him about the BBC\".\"I think he was going to phone me at the weekend but that call didn't happen, but we regularly have contact,\" the prime minister said.\"I speak to him fairly regularly as you know, [we] have an excellent relationship.\"Sir Keir also said any editorial failings should be addressed \"quickly\", and that he believes \"the principle of an independent trusted BBC is really important and should be defended\".The BBC's apology to the president said the Panorama episode had given the \"mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\".Trump has said he plans to sue the corporation for \"anywhere between $1bn (£759.8m) and $5bn (£3.8bn)\", but has not yet filed court papers.On Thursday, the US broadcast regulator chief wrote to the BBC to determine whether the corporation had provided the edited speech to any US TV channels.The BBC has previously stated it did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.The Telegraph also reported on Friday that one of Donald Trump's libel lawyers met Downing Street officials days after the US president threatened to sue the BBC.Robert Garson said his trip had nothing to do with the proposed lawsuit, but that they \"may have spoken about antisemitism at the BBC\".",

    "body": "23 minutes agoChris Ewokor,BBC Africa, Abuja  and Wycliffe MuiaAn unknown number of pupils have been abducted by armed men from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, the second mass school kidnapping this week. The latest attack targeted St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state, where authorities had already ordered the temporary closure of all boarding schools due to rising security threats. Details remain unclear but residents fear that close to 100 students and staff may have been taken away during the early-morning raid. Nigeria has faced a renewed wave of attacks by armed groups in recent days, including the kidnapping on Monday of more than 20 schoolgirls from a boarding school in nearby Kebbi state.Police said armed men - locally known as bandits - stormed St Mary's School on Friday at about 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and abducted an unconfirmed number of students from their hostel. Fear and uncertainty have gripped the area as families wait for news.The authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.\"Regrettably, St Mary's School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the state government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,\" they said in a statement.Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".The attack follows claims by US President Donald Trump that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria, an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has pushed back on these claims, describing them as \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".On Tuesday, gunmen opened fire on a church in south-western Kwara state, killing two people and abducting 38 others as the service was being broadcast online.However, the BBC has been told that the students abducted earlier this week in Kebbi state were Muslim. Two managed to escape, while 23 are still missing.President Bola Tinubu this week postponed his foreign trips to address the rising wave of attacks across Africa's most populous country.",

    "body": "Biggest prostate cancer screening trial in decades begins in UK11 hours agoFergus WalshMedical EditorGettyA major prostate cancer screening trial aimed at finding the best way to detect the disease has been launched in the UK.  The first letters have been sent out from GPs inviting men to join the study, the biggest of its kind in decades.The £42 million Transform trial is funded by Prostate Cancer UK and the National Institute for Health and Care Research.Hashim Ahmed, trial chief investigator, said: \"Transform is truly game-changing… the start of recruitment today marks a pivotal step towards getting the results men urgently need to make prostate cancer diagnosis safe and more effective so that we can unlock the potential of prostate cancer screening in the UK.\"The trial will recruit men aged 50-74, with a lower age limit of 45 for black men, who have twice the risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer compared with white men.It won't be possible to volunteer for the trial, but Prostate Cancer UK is strongly encouraging anyone who receives a letter to take part.The trial will look at how rapid MRI scans of the prostate could be combined with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood tests in order to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis.Currently, men over 50 can request a PSA test, which looks for abnormally high levels of protein in the blood, but this is unreliable, picking up many prostate cancers that would never need treatment, and missing others that do.The trial will also use spit tests, which extract DNA from saliva, to see if this is more accurate than PSA readings.Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said current diagnostics methods don't find enough aggressive cancers, and cause too much harm.\"We hear from men who were diagnosed late, whose lives may have been saved if they'd been screened or tested earlier. We also hear from a lot of men who have suffered incontinence or impotence because of treatments they had,\" said Mr Hobbs. \"Some of those men didn't need to have those treatments, and that's the harm that we need to try to avoid.\"'If we want to stop 12,000 men dying early every year, it's the obvious solution' Danny Burkey, 60, from west Yorkshire, is terminally ill with prostate cancer. By the time his condition was diagnosed four years ago, it had already spread to his bones.The former teacher and father of three told the BBC that if men were offered regular screening from the age of 50, his disease might have been caught when it was still curable.\"I think that a screening programme would be a game changer. If you want men to not be in the position I'm in, and if we want to stop 12,000 men dying early every year, it's the obvious solution.\"Danny BurkeyDanny, 60, with wife Jeanette, was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago - but it had already spread to his bones The opening of the trial comes a week before the National Screening Committee (NSC) - an expert body that advises the NHS - is due to announce whether to recommend the introduction of screening for the disease, the most common cancer in men in the UK.Previously, the NSC had concluded that the harms of screening outweighed the benefits.Initial results of the Transform trial are due in around two years, after which it will be expanded by up to 300,000 men across the UK.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLauren Turner and Ian Youngs,Culture reporterGetty ImagesIsrael's Yuval Raphael topped the public vote at this year's contest, and finished second overallThe Eurovision Song Contest is changing its rules around voting and promotion in the wake of controversy about Israel's result at this year's competition.Some countries raised concerns after Israel topped the public vote at the contest in May, finishing second overall after the jury votes were taken into consideration.Fans will now be able to cast 10 votes each, down from 20, and juries will return for the semi-finals.Organisers will also ban contestants and broadcasters from taking part in promotional campaigns by third parties including governments. Last year, there were reports that an Israeli government agency paid for adverts and used state social media accounts to encourage people to vote for its entry.Eurovision director Martin Green said there had been \"a lot of feedback from members and our fans\" following the 2025 show, saying they wanted Eurovision to \"have a good look at our rules\".\"There was a little fear that we're seeing some undue promotion particularly by third parties, perhaps governments, that are out of proportion of the rest of the natural promotion that you should see in the show,\" he said.He stressed he was \"not going to single any one participating broadcaster out\" but that the changes had been triggered by a number of promotional campaigns over recent years - especially by third parties - that were \"out of kilter\" with the spirit of the annual contest.Getty ImagesMartin Green said he hoped the measures would reassure participating broadcastersThe presence of Israel at Eurovision has also faced opposition from some participating countries because of the war in Gaza.Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Iceland and the Netherlands have all said they would consider boycotting next year's contest if Israel takes part. While Green did not address Israel's participation directly, he said he hoped the measures would \"give people reassurance that the contest remains an impartial and neutral space\".In a statement, he added: \"We are taking clear and decisive steps to ensure the contest remains a celebration of music and unity. The contest should remain a neutral space and must not be instrumentalised.\"The new rules:They will \"discourage disproportionate promotion campaigns... particularly when undertaken or supported by third parties, including governments or governmental agencies\". Organisers said broadcasters and artists would not be permitted to \"actively engage in, facilitate or contribute to promotional campaigns by third parties that could influence the voting outcome\".The number of votes that can be cast by members of the public will be cut from 20 to 10 per person, which Green said would mean people could still spread their votes \"amongst many acts\". After this year's contest, a Flemish MP said allowing 20 votes was \"a system that encourages manipulation\".Juries, currently only used for the grand final, are being brought back for the semi-final stage to \"make sure we're assuring that quality, that diversity of music\", Green said, \"as well as respecting what the public want\".Organisers will improve technical monitoring to \"detect and prevent fraudulent or co-ordinated voting activity, and strengthen monitoring of suspicious patterns\".Boycott threatA vote on Israel's participation had been due to take place in November, but the European Broadcasting Union, organisers of the annual contest, cancelled it due to \"recent developments in the Middle East\", including the ceasefire in Gaza.It said at the time that Israel's participation would instead be discussed at an in-person meeting in December, but it is not yet clear if a vote will still take place.Green said broadcasters and their artists participate, not governments, and it was important to \"keep the geopolitics off of the stage\".Austrian national broadcaster ORF, which will host the contest in 2026, has previously urged countries not to boycott the contest next year in Vienna.Asked if the vote would still be happening, Green said: \"We very much hope this package of measures gives our members the reassurance they need to ensure Eurovision remains a neutral and impartial space.\"Israel came second in the most recent Eurovision Song Contest in May, with its singer Yuval Raphael receiving the largest combined public vote.However, the addition of jury votes led to Austria's JJ being declared the winner for his song Wasted Love.ReutersJJ, the winner of the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest for Austria The final of the 70th Eurovision Song Contest will be held on 16 May. The semi-finals will be held earlier that week at the same venue, the Wiener Stadthalle. It will be the third time Vienna has hosted the annual show, most recently held there in 2015.  In the UK, Eurovision is broadcast by the BBC.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorSir Keir Starmer has labelled Nigel Farage \"spineless\" and accused him of failing to adequately explain reports of racist and antisemitic comments it is alleged the Reform UK leader made while at school.This week, the Guardian reported that Farage made antisemitic remarks at a fellow pupil at the private Dulwich College in south London and taught younger pupils racist songs. It is also alleged the now Reform UK leader put another pupil in detention when he was a prefect, because of the colour of their skin. The newspaper has spoken to 20 people who have claimed to them they were either a victim of, or witness to, racial abuse by Farage over a six year period.Reform UK insist the allegations are \"entirely without foundation\".Reacting to Sir Keir's comments, Farage said: \"For the weakest prime minister in living memory to call me spineless is utterly ludicrous.He added: \"The voters will have their say on both of us at the ballot box next May.\"Speaking to reporters on his way to the G20 Summit in South Africa, Sir Keir claimed Farage \"needs to explain the comments, or alleged comments that were made, and he needs to do that as soon as possible\".Sir Keir added that the Reform leader \"has not got a good track record in relation to this,\" given one of Reform's MPs remained in the parliamentary party after remarks she made about the ethnicity of people in television adverts.Sarah Pochin, who was elected to parliament in a by-election in May, said last month: \"It drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people, full of people who are basically anything other than white.\"Pochin argued \"it does not reflect our society\".She quickly apologised for the remarks, which the prime minister described at the time as \"shocking racism\".Farage said they were \"ugly\" but were not intended to be racist.Asked about Farage, Sir Keir said: \"The man is spineless\". \"If that had been someone in my party, I'd have dealt with it straightaway,\" he said.Farage \"needs to explain the latest allegations and whilst he's at it he needs to explain why he's too spineless to take action in relation to what is obvious racism in the comments of his fellow MP,\" Sir Keir said.\"He's got plenty of things to say about plenty of things, apart from showing some leadership when it comes to racism.\"A Reform source said the prime minister was \"desperate, sinking in the polls and lashing out\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoLaura GoodwinBBC ScotlandBBCKate Forbes is due to leave the Scottish parliament in 2026 Kate Forbes has admitted that motherhood is more difficult than being deputy first minister of Scotland.The Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP has revealed that trying to manage a huge job in government, a young family and a lengthy commute to parliament have proven impossible.Talking about her reasons for walking away from politics, she told BBC Scotland that nothing would tempt her back - not even the top job.\"From the very depths of my heart, I have no intentions of coming back to politics,\" she said.\"I can't promise you what I will be doing age 75, but I have no desire to return to frontline politics anytime soon.\"And I don't think there is any prize that's big enough to change my mind.\"Getty ImagesForbes was the first woman to deliver a Scottish BudgetThree months ago, Forbes - once a rising star of the SNP government - dropped the bombshell that she would not stand in next year's Scottish election.She insists she has had no wobbles since her announcement that she would now focus on family life.We are meeting in her hometown of Dingwall, 168 miles from Edinburgh where the Scottish Parliament sits.It is by any stretch, a hefty weekly commute and coupled with a young family and a demanding job, she says it became too big a challenge.A young high-flier, Forbes was thrust into the spotlight in February 2020 when she was promoted to finance secretary following the resignation of Derek MacKay.Earlier that month, with less than 24-hours' notice, she had become the first woman to deliver a Scottish Budget.Forbes marked another first when she became the first Scottish minister to take maternity leave, when she left to have her daughter Naomi in August 2022.'I realised I didn't have to'Already a step mum to three daughters, it was coming back to work after having Naomi that saw problems appear.She said: \"I went back to work post maternity leave. It has always felt impossible. Every day has felt like an exercise in logistical impossibilities, and we got through it.\"It was after a summer break with the family that she decided not to return to politics.\"Then it was like this epiphany - this bolt from the blue - that I didn't have to,\" she said. \"I had choices I could make.\"Despite Holyrood's claim to be a family-friendly parliament, four female MSPs cited family as their reason for not seeking re-election in 2021.This year it emerged seven MSPs were choosing to leave after only a single term at Holyrood.All are female, and concerns have been raised about young women like Natalie Don-Innes - a promising junior minister - leaving parliament to focus on their families.Getty ImagesForbes would take her daughter Naomi to work with her at the Scottish ParliamentForbes has criticised the Scottish Parliament's crèche facilities, which are only available for three hours a day from Tuesday to Thursday.The Scottish Parliament said its creche capacity was limited due to space but added it was \"constantly looking\" for ways to support members with caring responsibilities.The deputy first minister said: \"I am not the first and, unless anything changes, I am unlikely to be the last.\"So many parents know the pressures and the guilt of balancing all of this.\"Since announcing her decision to leave, she says other women have spoken to her about the difficulties they face in juggling motherhood and work.\"I hear that a lot from other women and I will hear it in the context of it being really difficult but not as difficult as my life and my job. My response to them is always,  from someone who has done the second biggest job in the Scottish government and been a mum - being a mum is harder.\"Getty ImagesKate Forbes was criticised for her faith and views on issues like gay marriage, gender and children born outside marriageIn her 10 years at Holyrood, Forbes rose through the ranks to her current position as John Swinney's deputy.She was seen as a potential future first minister, and came out of maternity leave early to run in the party's leadership race after the departure of Nicola Sturgeon.In March 2023, she came second to Humza Yousaf in that race.During the leadership campaign, Forbes faced criticism for her stance on issues like gay marriage, gender and children born outside marriage.\"The problem with our media culture is there is no space for nuance. In a lot of these issues there needs to be space for genuine open conversation,\" she said. Asked what she would do if one of her girls came to her and said, 'Mum I am pregnant' or 'I am gay' or 'I am trans', she says: \"Exactly as I would handle anything they come and speak to me about.\"Exactly as any mum would handle anything from a daughter or son, which is 'What do you need?' \"I am not challenging the question - but I think the premise of that question is the suggestion that people of faith can't love their kids in the same way that anyone can love their kids. All of us - faith or no faith - have a moral compass by which they live their lives.\"Getty ImagesA mother has never been first minister of Scotland. Given her experience, Forbes says she does think it would be possible, but with certain adjustments.\"Yes - but only with the right support around her,\" she said. \"Government taking seriously that she may not be able to do commitments before a certain time in the morning.\"It would need civil service support around her - including recognition that she will need support with her children and her family.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGetty ImagesThe ban on under-16s using social media is a world firstFrom 10 December, social media companies will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.The government says the ban - a world-first policy popular with many parents - is aimed at reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, which come from \"design features that encourage them to spend more time on screens, while also serving up content that can harm their health and wellbeing\".A study commissioned by the government earlier this year said 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour. This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.What platforms are affected?The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord have recently introduced age checks on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.How will the ban be enforced?Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches. The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.Getty ImagesA recent Australian government study found 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media - and seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviourThe government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods. It has also said platforms cannot rely on users declaring their own age, or on parents vouching for their children.Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has announced it will begin closing teen accounts from 4 December. Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said. The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.Will it work? Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.The government's own report found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently made headlines for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\". \"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"Are there data protection concerns?Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages. Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.How have social media companies responded?Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment. Getty ImagesThough included in the ban, YouTube has denied being a social media companyEven as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\". At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it. Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.Do other countries have similar bans?The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.In the UK, new safety rules introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a French parliamentary enquiry recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.Will children try to get around the ban?Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.",

    "body": "18 hours agoNick Triggle, Jim Reed, Dom Hughes and Michelle RobertsGetty ImagesThe long-awaited independent report into how well or badly the government handled the Covid pandemic has been published. Chairwoman of the inquiry, former judge Baroness Hallett, said the UK's response could be summarised as \"too little, too late\".The report looks at whether lockdowns were timely and reasonable, and what impact rule-breaking at the heart of government had on public confidence.Here are some of the main findings. Lockdown could have been avoided completelyThe report says lockdown could have been avoided if steps such as social distancing and isolating those with symptoms along with members of their household had been introduced earlier than mid-March 2020.But by the time ministers took action it was already too late and a lockdown was inevitable, it says.By the end of January 2020 it \"should have been clear that the virus posed a serious and immediate threat\", while February 2020 was \"a lost month\" and the lack of urgency overall in government was \"inexcusable\", the inquiry found.Voluntary measures were brought in on 16 March 2020, followed by the full stay-at home lockdown seven days later.But lockdown a week earlier could have saved thousands of livesBringing in lockdown a week earlier on 16 March would have meant 23,000 fewer deaths in England in the first wave, modelling suggests. This would have equated to 48% fewer deaths in the first wave.But the report does not suggest the overall death toll for the pandemic – 227,000 in the UK by the time it was declared over in 2023 – would have been reduced by an earlier lockdown.That is very difficult to tell, as it depends on a variety of other factors that could have reduced or increased the number of deaths as the pandemic progressed.'Chaotic' UK government with key figures criticisedThe report describes a \"toxic and chaotic\" culture at the heart of the UK government during its response to the pandemic, which it said affected the quality of advice and decision-making.While it says poor behaviour was displayed by a number of senior leaders and advisers, Boris Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings  is described as having been a \"destabilising influence\".It says his actions contributed \"significantly to a culture of fear, mutual suspicion and distrust that poisoned the atmosphere in 10 Downing Street\".PADominic Cummings was Johnson's chief adviser until he resigned in November 2020The then-PM Johnson is also criticised for excessive optimism in the face of the looming pandemic and \"oscillation\" on key lockdown decisions.The report says Johnson \"should have appreciated sooner that this was an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject urgency into the response\".Instead, he failed to appreciate the urgency of the situation \"due to his optimism it would amount to nothing\", it says.Meanwhile, his health secretary, Matt Hancock, is accused by Baroness Hallett of not being \"candid\" enough about the UK's ability to deal with the virus.Lockdowns left 'lasting scars'While the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021 undoubtedly saved lives, they also \"left lasting scars on society and the economy, brought ordinary childhood to a halt, delayed the diagnosis and treatment of other health issues and exacerbated societal inequalities\", it says.Children were not prioritised enough, with ministers failing to consider properly the consequences of school closures, the report says.It says the vast majority of children were not at risk of serious direct harm from Covid \"but suffered greatly from the closure of schools and requirement to stay at home\".None of the UK's four nations were adequately prepared for the sudden and enormous task of educating most children in their homes, the inquiry adds.Politicians breaking rules undermined public confidencePA MediaJohnson has been criticised in the inquiry's reportThe report says that rule-breaking by politicians and their advisers undermined public confidence in decision-making and significantly increased the risk that people wouldn't stick to the measures being put in place.It lists events such as Cummings' trip to Durham and Barnard Castle in March 2020; two visits to a second home during lockdown by the chief medical officer for Scotland, Dr Catherine Calderwood; and visits to the home of scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson by a woman with whom he was in relationship during lockdown.By the time details of parties and social events in Downing Street emerged in November 2021, there was a \"public outcry\", the report says.Johnson and Rishi Sunak subsequently received fixed penalty notices for their actions.Devolved governments relied too much on UKAll four nations were criticised for their planning and decision-making, which the inquiry says was hampered by the lack of trust between Boris Johnson and the first ministersThe inquiry found that at the start of 2020, while all four nations lacked urgency in their response, the devolved administrations were overly reliant on the UK government to lead the response.The four nations then differed in their strategy for exiting the first national lockdown, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland adopting a more cautious approach – but this was undermined by no restrictions on travel from England, where many restrictions had been eased.The report finds that in Autumn 2020, Holyrood was the only government to learn lessons from the first lockdown, and introduced tough, locally-targeted measures which helped avoid the need for a nationwide lockdown.On the other hand, decision-making in Northern Ireland was described as \"chaotic\", while the Welsh government's approach resulted in the highest age-standardised mortality rate of the four nations between August and December 2020.How could the UK have done better?The report gives a long list of recommendations, including:To establish structures to improve communication between the four nations during an emergencyImprove consideration of the impact decisions might have on people - both by the illness and the steps taken to respond to itCreate expert groups to advise on economic and social implications, not just the scienceEnsure decisions - and their implications - are clearly communicated to the publicEnable greater parliamentary scrutiny of emergency powersThe government doesn't have to adopt the inquiry's recommendations, but it must respond to them, which could shape future policies.The inquiry has already reported back on Britain's preparedness for the pandemic, concluding that the UK failed citizens with flawed plans.

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and BBC MonitoringBloomberg via Getty ImagesKirill Dmitriev has played a prominent role in Russia's return from diplomatic isolation in 2025Kirill Dmitriev is a rare breed of Russian diplomat.At 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.He is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.Dmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.His team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".  VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV/POOL/AFPWitkoff (R) and Dmitriev have struck up a close diplomatic rapportPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.He has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.The pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.Days later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.Dmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off. When Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.Unlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"Dmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.Getty ImagesWhen Putin travelled to the UAE in August, Dmitriev was there in the backgroundWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency, the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"  and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.Dmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.OLGA MALTSEVA/AFPDmitriev's wife is a friend of Katerina Tikhonova, a daughter of Vladimir PutinIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.Popova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.His rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.That scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.Dmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.While Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.His relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"He later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".After earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.Dmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.By 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.Increasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.He was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.His overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.The Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.Much of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity. He proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.He has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.Dmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where sanctions have been imposed on him for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians.",

So I have been prepared for some of this, but recognise I can't do it alone. I need to do it with other colleagues.\"</p><p>Dame Sarah said she realised that \"being the first woman is historic, and I often go to schools, and particularly the young women sit up and listen, and they don't want to be the Bishop of London or the Archbishop of Canterbury, but it does allow them to think there are possibilities for them to fulfil their dreams\".</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the most urgent issue in her in-tray is still to chart a better path towards dealing with abuse and treating with more compassion those affected by it.</p><p>There has also been a decline in church attendance, though London has to some extent bucked that trend.</p><p>One of the areas she has been most outspoken about it is assisted dying - she is a vociferous opponent, as was her predecessor.</p><p>When legislation was passed in the Commons, she described it as \"unworkable and unsafe and poses a risk to the most vulnerable people in our society\".</p><p>One of her roles as Bishop of London was to chair a body trying to steer the Church's decision on whether to bless same-sex marriages.</p><p>She described the decision to finally allow priests to bless same-sex couples in 2023 as \"a moment of hope for the Church\".</p><p>Rowan Williams, a former archbishop, summarised her new role as requiring a \"newspaper in one hand and a Bible in the other\".</p><p>Dr Williams told the BBC \"the expectation of having an opinion on everything is quite heavy.\"</p></div></article>",

As well as surgical errors, she was found to have had poor insight into her own levels of competence, partly through being inexperienced, and that she had failed to seek help from more senior colleagues.</p><p>At the time of the complaints, the cardiac unit at the Freeman was in disarray. A Royal College of Surgeons report in 2021 found a problematic working culture, while internal hospital reports criticised poor governance procedures, a reluctance from senior staff to take responsibility and an inadequate multi-disciplinary team (MDT) process - in which clinicians should come together prior to surgery to discuss the best options for patients.</p><p>Responding to the BBC, the hospital acknowledged the problems with the unit's culture, saying it tried to protect patients at all times.</p><p>It said it was \"currently considering\" the next stage of Ms Booth's phased return, \"in line with appropriate standards, review recommendations and external advice\". It did not respond to the BBC's questions as to whether it was safe for patients for Ms Booth to return to the cardiac unit, given the strong opposition from some of her colleagues.</p><p>In a statement, the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust said it acts \"in the best interests of patients\" and seeks \"to maintain and protect patient safety at all times, taking account of concerns shared by clinical colleagues\".</p></div></article>",

It was a \"very emotional\" but \"important\" call. The funerals of his family were held in Israel while he was still in Hamas captivity not knowing their fate.</p><p>Mr Sharabi has shown remarkable resilience in the months since. He has campaigned across the world for the hostages - even meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office. \"I ask him to finish the job and help all the others to come back as well,\" he pleads. </p><p>He feels Trump was instrumental in helping secure his release in a hostage deal in February, echoing the US president's vocal pressure in recent months on Israel and Hamas to find peace.</p><p>Asked by the BBC if he was worried the new peace plan might not happen, Mr Sharabi, speaking on Wednesday, replied: \"Of course - very worried. Probably two days ago we were sure it's very close, but it doesn't look that close, unfortunately. Maybe I don't know a few things, but I'll be glad to be surprised.\"</p><p>He said the proposal was \"very good news\" and people must \"not lose our faith that one day there will be an agreement\".</p><p>He says he knows all too well what horrors the hostages are still experiencing as Hamas refuses to release them and Israel has expanded its military campaign. So far, more than 66,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p>\"Everybody knows when the war continues it puts the hostages' life in risk. That's not a secret. For me, when I want all the 48 hostages back today, tomorrow, I just want it to stop… War is awful, people are suffering from war, but we can't forget who started that, and who's the bad guy and who's the good guy.\"</p><p>He has written a book titled Hostage to ensure people are aware of his ordeal. Lianne, an avid reader, used to tell him he didn't read enough - so he thinks she would be proud.</p><p>Though it is hard to carry on without his family, he says he doesn't need memorial days to remember them.</p><p>\"Yossi, Lianne, Noiya and Yahel are with me every day in my life, every moment. But I'm quite sure they will be alongside my life, not instead of my life.</p><p>\"I don't have the privilege to stay in bed and cry all day after my family and my friends fought for me for 500 days. It's unacceptable for me to do it.\"</p><p>In Israel, strangers approach and tell him he is a hero. His time as a hostage has strengthened his resolve to live despite the loss of his family.</p><p>\"It was very tough, but I really, really love life… I'm trying to be positive. I'm working on that.\"</p></div><div><p><span>More on this story</span></p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e941/live/881a7470-9f5f-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A thin, grey banner promoting the US Politics Unspun newsletter.

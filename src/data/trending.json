    "body": "Drugs disguised as tea keep washing up on this S Korean holiday island2 hours agoKelly NgJeju Coast GuardSome 28kg of ketamine, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found in the last two monthsSince September, residents on South Korea's Jeju island have been spotting small packs of what appear to be bags of Chinese tea washed ashore. Upon closer inspection, however, they were found to contain ketamine.Some 28kg (62 lbs) of the drug, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found on at least eight occasions, police say.Ketamine is used as an anaesthetic in medical procedures, but its recreational use is illegal in South Korea. It can cause severe physical and mental damage, including to the heart and lungs, when misused.The Jeju Coast Guard has formed a team to trace possible sea and land routes through which the drugs may have entered the country.Authorities have also warned residents not to touch or open any suspicious objects found along the shore, asking them to instead report such discoveries to police.On 15 October, a beach cleaner found 20kg of these \"tea bag drugs\" - the largest haul in the last two months - along the coast of Seogwipo in southern Jeju.Earlier this week, a team of more than 800 soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb the beaches in Jeju City, along the holiday island's northern coast, Korea JoongAng Daily reported. Investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the drugs drifted to Jeju via ocean currents, according to the national daily.It quoted the head of the Coast Guard's narcotics unit saying that similar discoveries of \"tea bag drugs\" have been made in Pohang, another city in South Korea, and Tsushima island in Japan. News1A team of more than 800 soldiers, police officiers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb through the beaches in Jeju CityJeju residents have shown concern over the presence of illicit drugs on their coastlines. \"I often bring my children to this beach,\" said Kim, a resident who witnessed the large-scale search effort in Jeju City this week.\"Seeing so many people looking for drugs is terrifying. I shudder to think that children might touch something like that,\" Kim told Korea JoongAng Daily.Another resident, Hyun, wants authorities to focus on \"stopping more [drugs] from drifting in\".Yoon Heung-hee, a professor at Hansung University's drug and alcohol addiction department, suggests a larger syndicate may be behind the ketamine packets. Some syndicates use a \"sea bump\" method to transport narcotics, he said, which involves dropping bundles of drugs equipped with trackers into the ocean for retrieval later.Criminal groups could have sought to smuggle the drugs across South Korea via Jeju by \"taking advantage of lax inspections at airports and ports\", Prof Yoon told The Hankyoreh, another local newspaper.Additional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "6 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSkims, the shapewear brand co-founded by celebrity and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, says it is now valued at $5bn (£2.93bn) after raising $225m of new funding.The company says it plans to use the money from investors, including an arm of Wall Street banking giant Goldman Sachs, to open more shops and expand around the world.\"We can't wait to take Skims to the next level as we continue to innovate and set the standard for our industry,\" Kardashian said on Wednesday.The funding round is one of the biggest this year for a US consumer brand and comes as Skims faces fierce competition from rivals like Lululemon.Skims, which runs 18 shops in the US and sells its products through retailers worldwide, will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail business over the next few years, it said in a statement.The company expects its sales to top $1bn this year, which Skims chief executive Jens Grede said gave the firm the confidence to pursue its long-term goals.The brand debuted in 2019 with a line of shapewear and has since broadened its range to include loungewear and other fashion categories.Getty ImagesSkims will focus \"predominantly\" on its physical retail businessThe company's growth has moved it deeper into the mainstream sports and athleisure market, which is largely dominated by brands like Lululemon and Alo Yoga.Skims has also amassed a large pool of influencers, including the Kardashians and other celebrities like Megan Fox and Paris Hilton to boost its appeal.Since its launch the company has faced some controversies. Its initial name, Kimono Intimates, was criticised for disregarding the significance of the traditional Japanese outfit, prompting the company to come up with another name - Skims.One Skims product - a head wrap worn during sleep - split the internet. Some hailed it as the future of non-invasive face contouring, but others condemned it as dystopian, and said the firm was making women feel more insecure.",

    "body": "The Princess of Wales' annual Christmas carol service is to take place for the fifth year early next month, with British movie stars Kate Winslet, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hannah Waddingham delivering readings at the event. The \"power of love and togetherness\" will be celebrated at the Together at Christmas event led by Catherine, who wants to recognise people across the country who contribute to society.Organisers said the theme was picked because people will be able to celebrate love in all forms in a world that can often feel fragmented and disconnected.The service -  which will be a mixture of traditional and modern elements to include people of all faiths and none - will be held in Westminster Abbey on 5 December.Last Christmas, Catherine similarly focused on love, and the importance of giving and receiving empathy, following her cancer diagnosis earlier in the year. She spoke of her relief at completing her course of chemotherapy in September 2024, and revealed this year in January that she is in remission from cancer.In 2021, she surprised guests with her piano-playing skills alongside musician Tom Walker in a clip shown at the event, which was staged for people who supported their communities during the Covid pandemic.Guests at the event will be people who have been nominated by lord-lieutenants across the UK and charities linked to the royal family. Among them will also be guests who have been invited after having shown love and kindness this year.As well as the readings by the British acting stars, carols will be sung by the Westminster Abbey choir, alongside musical performances.A festive display based on the importance of nature in our lives, created by horticulturist Jamie Butterworth, will feature at the event. The Royal Horticultural Society is also set to donate wreaths made by their ambassadors and schoolchildren.Across the UK, 15 community carol services on the same theme of love and togetherness will also take place, including in a community farm in Gwent and an arts centre in Newbury.The Westminster Abbey service will air on ITV1 and ITVX on Christmas Eve and again on Christmas Day.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNewly released emails suggesting Donald Trump knew about the conduct of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dominate Thursday's papers. \"He knew about the girls\" is the Guardian's headline, quoting directly from one of the messages released by Democrats on the House oversight committee. The email is one of three published exchanges containing allegations that the US president was aware of Epstein's activities. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Trump \"spent hours\" at Epstein's house with a woman later identified as a victim of sex trafficking is the Financial Times' lead, as it focuses on another allegation revealed in the newly released emails. The paper quotes one senior Democrat saying the latest messages spark \"glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding\" about the nature of Trump and Epstein's relationship.The Daily Mirror echoes with its headline \"Trump 'spent hours with Giuffre'\", naming Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre as one of the women referenced in the new emails. The White House came out in defence of the US president, and accused Democrats of \"selectively leaking emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".Splashed across the Independent is the infamous photo of Trump and his wife Melania with Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell taken at Mar-a-Lago in 2000. The paper also quotes from one of the \"bombshell messages\" in which Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize the dog that hasn't barked is Trump.\"Shifting to news closer to home, the Daily Telegraph's main story covers the ongoing murmurs of a leadership challenge against Sir Keir Starmer. \"Streeting goes to war with No 10\" is the paper's headline after the health secretary was accused of plotting against the prime minister by Sir Keir's top allies. Streeting denied the accusations and branded Downing Street as \"toxic\" and \"juvenile\", the paper reports.\"I am and always have been a faithful\" is how Metro reports the health secretary's response. The paper details Streeting's \"fury\" at the implication that he is leading a \"Traitors-style plot to banish Starmer\" and mocks up a picture of him in the Round Table room of the aforementioned TV show.In another twist to Labour's leadership \"civil war\", the Times says cabinet ministers are demanding the sacking of the PM's chief of staff over allegations he had advance knowledge of the briefings that accused Streeting of a leadership coup. Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir's most senior aide, has categorically denied criticising the health secretary to the media.\"No 10 in turmoil\" is the i Paper's take, as it describes ministers turning their anger on McSweeney. The paper describes the \"cabinet despair\" over the attacks against the health secretary and Downing Street's \"paranoia over Labour plots\".The Daily Mail features a warning to those potential \"Labour plotters\" from the PM's allies. Those close to Sir Keir say any plans to oust him could trigger a general election, the paper reports. \"At last, a ray of hope!\" declares a sardonic Mail sub-headline.The Daily Express spotlight's the view from the Tories on Labour's infighting. The paper headlines on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's comments accusing the PM of \"being in office, but not in power\".The Daily Star turns its attention to attention to music and the news that singer Dua Lipa and bands Coldplay and Radiohead are backing a cap on ticket resale prices to foil touts and give music back to the fans. The paper praises the move as a \"Boldplay\".Finally, the Sun teases a \"Ramsay wedding exclusive\" as it reports that Olympian Adam Peaty was given a police escort at Manchester Airport after receiving threats on his stag do ahead of his wedding to Holly Ramsay. The pair are set to tie the knot at Christmas.The Times reports that cabinet ministers are demanding the sacking of the No 10 chief of staff Morgan McSweeney because of what the paper calls \"vicious\" Downing Street briefings against the health secretary.The Daily Telegraph leads on Wes Streeting's response, when he called the briefings toxic and juvenile. Sir Keir Starmer's allies have warned that ousting him could trigger a general election, according to the Daily Mail.The leader column in the Sun says Downing Street is in the grip of suicidal paranoia and the government has exploded into civil war.The Daily Mirror leads on the release of emails related to Jeffrey Epstein in the US, and pictures Donald Trump with the late sex offender at Mar-a-Lago in 1997.The Financial Times quotes one email apparently written by Epstein, in 2015, to a New York Times reporter, asking if they would like \"photos of Donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen\".  \"Epstein messages pile pressure on Trump\" is the headline for the Guardian which highlights the president's claim that Democrats are trying to distract from their role in the federal government shutdown.The BBC is preparing to apologise formally to president Trump over last year's misleading Panorama edit, according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper says lawyers at the corporation are working on the wording of the BBC's response.Sources tell the i Paper the BBC believes it could win a court battle if Trump carries out his threat to sue for $1bn, but they are said to fear that an angry president could destroy its US ambitions.Many of the papers pick up on an analysis of Adolf Hitler's DNA that's to be the subject of a Channel 4 documentary.The Times says a grisly memento taken from his Berlin bunker - a blood-stained piece of sofa fabric - has revealed he had Kallman syndrome, a genetic disorder that hinders the typical progression of puberty, and sexual development.As the Daily Telegraph puts it, scientists believe the wartime song about Hitler and his henchmen was correct: he did only have one ball, and possibly a micro-penis.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "10 minutes agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty Images\"It's not been our finest 24 hours in government,\" one senior figure in government acknowledged to me, after mudslinging one way and another, some in public, plenty more in private.It began with anonymous briefings to journalists that Keir Starmer would fight any attempt to remove him - and that cabinet ministers, including Wes Streeting, were plotting challenges.Streeting insisted he was loyal to the PM and called on those behind the briefings to be sacked, and the PM announced that any attacks on his ministers were \"unacceptable\".Questions about whether the PM had authorised the original briefings to flush out potential challengers - and whether those behind the briefings were doing so with his approval were thrown into the mix.Would there be a leak inquiry? Would there be sackings at what Streeting called a \"toxic\" Number 10 operation?What were those close to the prime minister hoping to achieve?I have been making loads of phone calls to patch together what actually happened and where all this leaves Keir Starmer's government.There are two key facts at the heart of all of this: the government is unpopular and so is the prime minister.These facts are the rocket fuel behind the constant conversations I hear about what Labour is trying to do about it and what it might mean for how long Sir Keir Starmer carries on in Downing Street.But let's get to the aftermath of all that mudslinging.I have never authorised attacks on ministers, says PMStreeting denies plotting against PM after leadership claimsStarmer will fight attempts to replace him, allies sayThe prime minister and Health Secretary Wes Streeting spoke on the phone on Wednesday evening to patch things up.I hear Sir Keir apologised to Streeting in the brief call and they agreed to talk in further detail \"soon\".They didn't talk about Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister's chief of staff - who has become a lightning rod for criticism from everyone including the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch in public to Labour figures junior and senior in private.Widely credited as the mastermind of Labour's election landslide and the political brain behind Sir Keir's quick rise since switching from Director of Public Prosecutions, McSweeney is also among the first to face criticism when the Downing Street machine is perceived to have stuttered, stumbled or outright failed.He is not responding to requests for comment, as some call for his head on a stick.His critics argue that in a Downing Street where McSweeney is called on to make plenty of big political judgements, he should take responsibility for how all of this unfolded.Others in the building insist no-one who works there was behind any briefing against a cabinet minister, after Wes Streeting said whoever was responsible should be sacked.In No 10, there is a tacit acknowledgement that the health secretary handled a round of pre-arranged interviews on Wednesday morning with dignity, aplomb and humour - despite being confronted by incessant questions about his own ambitions because those briefings about him came just hours before.For some Labour MPs, he demonstrated a nimbleness and knack for communication they only wish the Prime Minister shared.It also won't have gone unnoticed that at least some of those briefings that attempted to shore up the prime minister ended up creating an opportunity for Streeting to say he shared the sentiment of his colleagues who have described Downing Street as toxic and sexist and that those who were behind the briefings should be sacked.What a mess.\"I'm a faithful\" - Wes Streeting denies plan to challenge Starmer as PMThe prime minister, I am told, is \"incandescent\" at how all of this has played out and is looking into how it all happened.What appears to have gone awry, from No 10's perspective, is both volume and emphasis.Firstly, they had, perhaps naively, imagined that the briefings would generate some news, but not wall-to-wall headline news. It turned out to be much louder than they had anticipated.I'd say a prime minister letting this kind of thing be known, via supporters, less than 18 months after a landslide general election win, was always going to be front page, top of bulletins stuff – as it turned out to be, on these pages and others.And secondly, on emphasis, they insist they hadn't expected so much talk about Wes Streeting, which was then massively magnified by all those interviews he was booked in to do on Wednesday morning. Others, it must be said, concluded that that was precisely the intention.It has been another few days where Labour folk in government talk about lessons being learnt and on the backbenches plenty are irritated at what they see as an absurd spectacle playing out that they have to firstly witness and then attempt to defend.And they would rather not do either.But a government and a prime minister whose nervousness about their predicament is even bigger than their big majority will likely see repeats of this saga, unless they can quickly address the deep lack of popularity that drives it.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAna Faguyon Capitol HillWatch: Trump signs bill to end longest US government shutdownPresident Donald Trump has signed a spending bill to reopen the government and end the longest shutdown in US history.He signed the short-term budget into law just hours after the House of Representatives voted 222-209 to approve it on Wednesday night, and two days after the Senate narrowly approved the same package.In the Oval Office, Trump said the government would now \"resume normal operations\" after \"people were hurt so badly\" from the 43-day shutdown.Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees have been on unpaid leave or working without pay. Food aid has also been left in limbo and air travel has been disrupted nationwide.Government services are expected to reopen in the coming days, while disruptions to air travel will likely ease ahead of the looming Thanksgiving holiday. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had reduced air traffic because of staff shortages owing to the shutdown.ANALYSIS: Democrats left bruised after historic shutdown yields littleThat had direct impacts on members of Congress attempting to reach the nation’s capital on Wednesday for the House vote. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican, rode his motorcycle nearly 1,000 miles (1,609km) across the country to cast his vote in the House before it was sent to the president's desk.The bill only provides funding to keep the government open until 30 January, when lawmakers will once again need to find a way to fund the government. Before he signed it into law, Trump repeatedly cast blame for the shutdown on the Democratic Party. \"They did it purely for political reasons,\" he said.\"When we come up to midterms and other things, don't forget what they've done to our country,\" he added.Senate Democrats were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber, because Republicans were still seven short of the 60-vote threshold required to pass a funding bill. They initially refused to support the bill, demanding that Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year.Republicans maintained that a healthcare discussion could come after the government was reopened.But on Sunday, a group of eight Senate Democrats broke from the party and helped pass the spending package. They voted for it in exchange for a promise of a vote on those healthcare subsidies in December.It led to fury within the Democratic Party, and public criticism from figures such as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and California Governor Gavin Newsom.Watch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdownSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the chamber, said the package \"fails to do anything of substance to fix America's healthcare crisis\".Virginia Senator Tim Kaine was among the group of Democrats who voted in favour of the compromise. He pushed back on that criticism, and said the federal workers he represents were \"saying thank you\" for agreeing the deal.Hours before the House voted to reopen the government, Democrats in Congress watched as their newest lawmaker was sworn into office. The addition did not provide enough leverage to impact whether healthcare subsidies were included in the government funding bill, but Democrats welcomed Adelita Grijalva into their ranks with applause on the floor of the chamber. The Democratic representative for Arizona was elected on 23 September, but the House has not been in session since 19 September, delaying her swearing in. She is stepping into the seat once held by her father, Raul Grijalva, who died earlier this year.Democrats immediately tapped their newest member to back a petition to force a vote on legislation requiring the release of files related to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The petition will need to sit for seven legislative days before it can be called up for floor consideration - and then House leadership will be required to schedule a vote within two legislative days.House Speaker Mike Johnson surprised many on Wednesday and said he would schedule a vote for next week. What's in the spending deal?The deal negotiated over the weekend extends funding for the federal government until 30 January.It also includes full-year funding for the Department of Agriculture, as well as funding for military construction and legislative agencies.Guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) - which provides food aid to one in eight Americans - until next September are also included in the bill.The package includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending the healthcare subsidies which Democrats had been holding out for concessions on.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "UK's first small nuclear power station to be built in north Wales 2 hours agoGareth Lewis,Wales political editor and Steffan Messenger,Wales environment correspondentBBCWork will begin next year, with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030sA first-of-its-kind nuclear power station is to be built on Anglesey, bringing up to 3,000 jobs and billions of pounds of investment.The plant at Wylfa, on the Welsh island's northern coast, will have the UK's first three small modular reactors (SMR), although the site could potentially hold up to eight.Work is due to start next year with the aim of generating power by the mid 2030s.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind. Today, that changes.\"The news was also welcomed by First Minister Eluned Morgan, who said she had been \"pressing the case at every opportunity for Wylfa's incredible benefits\".Using the Welsh name for Anglesey, she described it as \"the moment Ynys Môn and the whole of Wales has been waiting for\".The project, which could power about three million homes, will be built by publicly owned Great British Energy-Nuclear and is backed by a £2.5bn investment from the UK government.SMRs work similarly to large reactors, using a nuclear reaction to generate heat that produces electricity - but are a fraction of the size, with about a third of the generating output.Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Energy-Nuclear, said: \"This is a historic moment for the UK, and is another momentous step in realising Britain's potential in leading the way on nuclear energy.\"These first SMRs at Wylfa will lay the groundwork for a fleet-based approach to nuclear development, strengthening the UK's energy independence and bringing long-term investment to the local economy.\"The company has also been tasked with identifying potential sites for another large-scale nuclear power plant, similar to those being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk, which have the potential to power the equivalent of six million homes.It will report back by autumn 2026, and has been requested by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband to consider sites across the UK, including in Scotland, officials said.It is not clear whether the SMR plans, which are smaller and more straightforward to build, rule Wylfa out from being considered after it was designated the preferred location in 2024 by the previous UK Conservative government.The decision to opt for small modular reactors at Wylfa was criticised by the US ambassador Warren Stephens, who said he was \"extremely disappointed\" by the decision.He had been urging ministers to commit to a large-scale plant, with US firm Westinghouse having reportedly presented plans to build a new gigawatt station at the site.\"If you want to get shovels in the ground as soon as possible and take a big step in addressing energy prices and availability, there is a different path, and we look forward to decisions soon on large-scale nuclear projects,\" Mr Stephens said.'Nuclear equivalent of an Ikea chair'One industry expert described the announcement as \"incredible\".Prof Simon Middleburgh, director of the Nuclear Futures Institute at Bangor University, said: \"They're smaller than the average reactor, built in a modular manner in factories and shipped to the site to be put together a bit like an Ikea chair.\"The planned SMRs \"fit nicely\" with the existing grid capacity at the Wylfa site, offering a similar electricity output as the old power plant currently being decommissioned, he added.There were \"a few more hurdles to go through\", he cautioned - from securing regulatory approval, building the factories required to construct the SMRs and training the workforce that will run them.Opponents of the project point to the fact that a long-term storage facility for the UK's nuclear waste is yet to be agreed upon and say investment in renewable energy schemes - wind, wave and tidal - is what Anglesey needs.Dylan Morgan of campaign group People Against Wylfa-B told BBC Wales the proposed SMRs were far from \"small\" and were in fact \"an unnecessarily big development of an unproven technology\".\"Modular reactor technologies have been touted by many companies internationally but are still only plans on paper,\" he said.The government sees them as a secure, reliable, affordable and low carbon energy system and is convinced that, with investment, SMRs will create thousands of jobs and boost manufacturing.Wylfa beat off competition from another site at Oldbury in Gloucestershire, with the reactors designed by British engineering firm Rolls-Royce, subject to final contracts, which are expected later this year.The UK government said the plant would help provide energy independence.The old nuclear power plant at Wylfa was switched off in 2015 and previous plans for a large-scale replacement fell through in 2021.The company behind the scheme – the Japanese industrial giant Hitachi - cited spiralling costs and a failure to reach agreement with the UK government over funding.Sasha Wynn Davies - now chairwoman of the Wales Nuclear Forum - worked as a senior manager on those plans.\"I will never forget going to the secondary school in Amlwch and speaking to some of the young students and pupils there to unfortunately say that we were not progressing as a project,\" she said.\"I will never forget their faces as they were so sad on behalf of their hopes for the future but also for their parents and what it meant for the area economically and socially.\"So now let's hope our time has come again and there's hope for our young people in particular.\"There is a huge political component to the announcement, with Labour's leadership in Westminster keen to show that it means business when it comes to big investment in infrastructure projectsIn Wales, the first minister has been pushing hard for Wylfa - and the announcement comes just six months before the Senedd election.Eluned Morgan has been trying to strike a balance: differentiating the Welsh party from UK Labour, but also pushing for extra funding, further devolution of powers and big investment announcements from her UK colleagues.She has certainly got the latter, although plenty of other issues such as reform to the way Wales is funded and devolution of the Crown Estate – the body which owns much of the Welsh coastline and vital to future wind power – remain unresolved.More top stories",

    "body": "5 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonWatch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdownAfter 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end.Federal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.After the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?Senate Democrats, through their use of the parliamentary filibuster, were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.They drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. When a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.Since then, members of the party's left flank have been furious. They've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.Even more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"Newsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.If he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.Watch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US historyFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.On Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"Trump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.Although there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.While his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.EPADemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries was critical of the funding dealWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.While several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.Democrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.Meanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.And that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Later on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.It was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.It was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.",

    "body": "ByChris BevanBBC Sport journalist and Chris CollinsonBBC Sport statisticianAnd then there was one.Thomas Tuchel's latest squad has laid bare the current dearth of English centre-forwards, with Harry Kane the only out-and-out striker in the 25-man group.Admittedly that is partly down to injury, with Tuchel explaining Ollie Watkins has been rested to manage an ongoing issue, while Dominic Solanke has been sidelined since August and Liam Delap is only just back in action for Chelsea after two months out.We should not forget that some more versatile forwards have been selected, too. Marcus Rashford, Jarrod Bowen, Phil Foden and Anthony Gordon may not be traditional number nines but they could be asked to play through the middle against Serbia and Albania this week.But still, seeing Kane as the only true striker's name is a stark reminder of how heavily England rely on the 32-year-old as the fulcrum of their attack, with the shortage of other options to lead their line a real worry before next summer's World Cup and, especially, beyond.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kane is England's all-time record goalscorer, with 76 goals in 110 senior appearancesKane has been prolific in the Bundesliga with Bayern Munich this season - but just eight English strikers have appeared in the Premier League in the current campaign and 22-year-old Delap is the only one under the age of 26.Behind Delap, there does not appear to be a new generation waiting for its chance, either.England Under-21s went to last summer's European Championship without a recognised striker and their latest squad includes only one, Manchester City's Divin Mubama, 21, who is yet to score in the Premier League and is currently on loan at Championship side Stoke.So, where have all the English number nines gone, and why is the country not producing traditional strikers anymore?Fewer games, and different systemsThere are some English strikers out there, but when you look at their stats, they are not exactly encouraging.Danny Welbeck, who turns 35 at the end of the month, and 33-year-old Callum Wilson are the only ones who have scored more than one goal in the Premier League this season.Of those under consideration by Tuchel who play further afield, Ivan Toney is the most prolific in the current campaign with 11 goals in 15 games for Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli, whom he joined in 2024.Tuchel picked the 29-year-old for the games against Andorra and Senegal in June, but Toney only featured as an 88th-minute substitute in the Senegal friendly, and has not made it into another squad since.This shortage of number nines is not down to a sudden drop-off in numbers. Instead it's a trend that has been going on for a while.Last season, just three English strikers - Watkins (16), Delap (12) and Welbeck (10) scored 10 or more Premier League goals, the fewest ever.It's a far cry from the first season of the Premier League era in 1992-93, when 20 English strikers passed the 10-goal mark.In recent years, however, what was already a steep decline has fallen off a cliff. Last season, only 67 goals were scored by English strikers, less than half the number in 2020-21.Kane's departure from Tottenham for Germany has played a part, of course, but he left for Bayern in 2023 and English strikers still scored 96 goals in 2023-24.If anything, this campaign is shaping up to be even worse.So far, English strikers have scored only 11 goals between them - and they are on course for a meagre total of 38 collectively, if they continue at their present rate. That's only four more than Andy Cole and Alan Shearer each scored as they topped the Premier League scoring charts 30 years ago.Cole bagged 34 goals for Newcastle in 1993-94 and Shearer netted the same number for Blackburn the following season - still the record haul for English strikers in the Premier League era, albeit in 42-game seasons.The decline of English strikers is down to several factors according to BBC pundit Chris Sutton, who passed the 10-goal mark himself in four separate Premier League campaigns, including a 25-goal haul with Norwich in 1993-94, and an 18-goal season with Blackburn that saw him take a share of the Golden Boot in 1997-98.One reason is a lack of appearances. From the table above, only Welbeck, Watkins and Calvert-Lewin have started more than three league games this season, while Nketiah, Solanke and Barnes have not started any.\"If you look back at the 1990s, players like Jurgen Klinsmann and Dennis Bergkamp started arriving from abroad but the overall number of foreign strikers was much lower,\" Sutton explained.\"The number one striker of my era was Shearer but if you went through the teams, then there were so many brilliant English centre-forwards like Ian Wright, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole, Teddy Sheringham, Robbie Fowler and David Hirst - you could add Stan Collymore and Dion Dublin to that list too.\"There was an unbelievable number of them, even before Michael Owen came through ahead of the 1998 World Cup, and all different types of striker too.\"One of the differences is that they were all playing every week, because how many English centre-forwards start for their clubs in the Premier League now? That's down to the quality which the clubs can attract from elsewhere.\"Another change we've seen is in the way teams are set up. I am not saying everyone was a rigid 4-4-2 back in my day, because that's nonsense, but far fewer sides play with two strikers now.\"In other ways, things have gone full circle, because if you look at teams like Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United, then the big number nine is back in fashion. There are plenty of strikers in the Premier League, just not many who are English.\"Did people stop wanting to be a striker?Shearer, who formed the devastating 'SAS' partnership with Sutton to help Blackburn win the Premier League title in 1995, feels the tactical shifts we have seen over the past 10 to 15 years are the biggest reason for the current shortage of strikers.\"Because of the way kids have been training and the coaching they have had, no-one wants to play at centre-forward because you very rarely get a touch,\" the former England captain told The Rest is Football podcast.\"Instead, coaches want a pass from the keeper, a pass to the side, then a pass into midfield... and then it goes back. As a centre-forward you are thinking 'I am not getting involved'.\"I am convinced that is why there is a lack of number nines, particularly in our country.\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, The SAS - Shearer And Sutton - partnership that fired Blackburn Rovers to the 1994-95 title scored 49 Premier League goals between them that season, although Shearer did get 34 of themSutton agrees with his old strike partner and, although modern-day wide forwards like Rashford and Bukayo Saka are scoring more goals than old-school wingers ever did, he sees the current situation as \"a massive problem\".\"Alan makes a good point about how everyone wants to mess around on the ball these days,\" Sutton explained. \"Everyone wants to be a creative player off the wide areas, or be a left-footer cutting in off the right wing. Those players can score goals too, but it is very different to having someone who can lead the line.\"Owen, who shared the Premier League Golden Boot with Sutton as an 18-year-old in 1997-98 and won the award outright the following year, feels he would not be considered as a striker if he emerged now.\"In today's game, I think I would have been one of the wide players,\" he told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. \"I don't think I had the stature to occupy two defenders, so I guess I would have played on the left.\"The worry I have for strikers is that I spent my life learning my trade, playing off people. Now, how are we going to reinvent those pairings. I have been waiting and waiting for teams to go back to having two, but will it ever happen?\"Image source, Rex FeaturesImage caption, Owen (number 10) struck up a seemingly telepathic partnership up front with his Liverpool and Three Lions team-mate Emile Heskey (number nine) for club and country. They both scored in England's famous 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, with Owen netting a hat-trick'We've got Kane, but then what?'Playing with two strikers is not an option for Tuchel this week, at least not in the way Owen means.\"Just on numbers alone, the situation is incomparable to the 1990s,\" Sutton added. \"But when you actually list the players we had then, there was unbelievable depth of quality too and a lot of them didn't really get a look in for England.\"Ferdinand only won 17 caps but he was phenomenal. Fowler, who only got a few more, was probably the most natural finisher you could ever see. But they were both behind Shearer because he was like a machine with the way he finished.\"Sutton only won one full cap, coming on as a substitute against Cameroon in November 1997, before falling out with then England boss Glenn Hoddle when he turned down a call-up to the England B team in February 1998.\"I can joke about how I messed things up with Hoddle but nowadays you would be rubbing your hands if you are a half-decent striker with a World Cup coming up,\" he added. \"We have got Kane, but then what?\"If you're an English centre-forward now and you can kick a ball straight, you've got a good chance of going to the World Cup. I feel like dusting my boots off myself.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Harry Kane has been England's number nine since 2015, but who will be next to wear the famous shirt?FootballEngland Men's Football Team",

    "body": "Type 1 diabetes is worse in the young - here's why6 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentNye familyGracie Nye in hospital when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetesScientists have discovered why type 1 diabetes is more severe and aggressive when it develops in young children.Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking cells in the pancreas that control blood sugar levels.The research team showed the pancreas was still developing in childhood, particularly under the age of seven, making it far more vulnerable to damage.They say newly developed drugs could buy patients time for the pancreas to mature, delaying the disease.Type 1 diabetes affects around 400,000 people in the UK.Gracie, age eight from Merseyside, became suddenly ill on Halloween in 2018. It started as a slight cold, but rapidly escalated.\"She went from being a very happy one-year-old, who would go to nursery and dance and sing, to almost dying in less than 48 hours,\" says dad Gareth.\"The diagnosis remains the worst part of our life.Suddenly everything we took for granted was 10-20 times harder,\" he says.Nye familyNye family, with Gracie wearing pink glassesThe Nye family had to adapt quickly - keeping on top of everything Gracie had to eat or drink, checking blood sugar levels and giving the hormone insulin to tell her body to absorb the sugar in her blood.Gracie now has a glucose monitor and an insulin pump and is \"bossing diabetes\", says her dad.\"Gracie's a superstar,\" he adds.But why children diagnosed young like Gracie, especially those under the age of seven, have a more aggressive disease than those diagnosed in their teenage years or later, has remained a mystery.   The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows it is down to the development of the beta cells living in the pancreas.These are the cells that release the hormone insulin when sugar levels rise in the blood after we eat. Researchers at the University of Exeter studied pancreas samples from 250 donors, allowing them to see how the beta cells formed normally as people got older, and in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes UKEarlier in life these beta cells were shown to exist as small clusters or as individual cells, but as we age they grow in number and mature into larger groups known as Islets of Langerhans.The study was able to see what happened after the immune system turned against a patient's own beta cells.Beta cells in small clusters were picked off and destroyed so they never had the chance to mature. Those in larger islets were still attacked, but were more durable allowing patients to still produce low levels of insulin which reduced the severity of their disease.\"I think this is a really significant finding for type 1 diabetes - this research really sheds light on why the disease is more aggressive in children,\" Dr Sarah Richardson, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC.She said \"the future is much brighter\" for children being diagnosed with type 1 now. This includes the possibility of screening healthy children for the disease and of new immunotherapy drugs to delay it.The UK has licensed teplizumab - an immunotherapy that can stop the immune system attacking beta cells and may be able to give them time to mature - although it is not available on the NHS. \"Because we have new drugs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in children, we hope that these will be able to prevent or delay the onset in those young people,\" said Dr Richardson.Missing piece of the puzzleThe research was part of the Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge organised by the Steve Morgan Foundation, Diabetes UK, and Breakthrough T1D. Rachel Connor, director of research partnerships at Breakthrough T1D, said: \"This study gives us a missing piece of the puzzle, explaining why type 1 diabetes progresses so much faster in children than in adults.\"Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of research and clinical at Diabetes UK, said: \"Uncovering why type 1 diabetes is so aggressive in young children opens the door to developing new immunotherapies aimed at slowing or stopping the immune attack, potentially giving children more precious years without insulin therapy and, one day, preventing the need for it entirely.\"",

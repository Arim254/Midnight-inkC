    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold (l) and Drake Maye (r) have had great starts to the season but it's been tough for Patrick MahomesByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistNine weeks down and nine to play in the NFL, so time to take stock and reflect on the first half of the 2025 season.No team has been really dominant this year, all of the 32 sides have had at least two defeats and most of the eight divisions are still pretty much wide open.So just who will be contending for the Super Bowl in Santa Clara in February is still very much up for grabs - although a few sides have already played their way out of contention.Here's our pick of the best and worst from the first half of the season.Who are the Super Bowl favourites?The bookmakers still have the Kansas City Chiefs as at least joint-favourites with Buffalo, but after the Bills beat them on Sunday the favoured Super Bowl match-up right now would be the Bills against the Philadelphia Eagles.But they're by no means the only two standout teams in the NFL right now - quarterback Josh Allen is playing great but the Bills are still second in their division, while the Eagles have had a few dud performances early on.However, the Eagles are the champions and have a growing lead in the NFC East, plus they made some big moves on trade deadline day so remain the team to beat.Who are the main contenders?Image caption, Most of the NFL's eight divisions are wide open at the halfway stageThe Denver Broncos and New England Patriots look the most solid challengers in the AFC after the Indianapolis Colts had a nightmare on Sunday - with consistency throughout the league tough to come by.The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are quietly going about their business but have a tough run coming up, while the Green Bay Packers lead the NFC North but have also thrown in some dodgy defeats against the Cleveland Browns and Carolina Panthers.The Detroit Lions will be thereabouts again but also need some consistency while the NFC West is stacked with contenders as the Los Angeles Rams, Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers all have six wins and are all in play-off spots as it stands.Biggest surprise packages so farThe New England Patriots are well ahead of schedule at 7-2 after two successive 4-12 seasons, with new head coach Mike Vrabel's side on the joint-longest winning streak in the league with six in a row - including a statement primetime win over the Bills in Buffalo.The Pats have the sixth best defence in points allowed and the seventh best scoring offence so are really well balanced, and second-year quarterback Drake Maye has been the most accurate passer in the league so far.Nobody expected too much from Daniel Jones in Indianapolis but the much-maligned former Giants quarterback was superb in leading the league's top scorers for eight weeks.It all came crashing down against Pittsburgh in week eight, with Jones doubling the team's season totals for interceptions and fumbles, so they need to show who the real Colts are as their schedule starts to hot up.And could the tide finally be turning in Carolina? The Panthers are 5-4 and chasing a first winning season since 2017. Only one of those victories came against a side with a winning record, but it was the Packers on Sunday in what could be a statement success.The Panthers will need to improve on their average 18.9 points a game on offence to make that more than a one-off, but the signs are positive at least.Biggest disappointments this seasonThe Baltimore Ravens have had huge injury problems, not least with Lamar Jackson, but they would still have hoped for better than a 3-5 start.The one bright spot is that the AFC North is dodgy this year and they aren't far behind the Steelers, who they still have to play twice as two of five divisional games that could yet see them somehow rescue their season. Quarterback injuries to Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels have also hampered the Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Commanders in their poor returns - although even Burrow would struggle with Cincy's woeful defence.Dallas Cowboys fans may be disappointed but would they really be surprised? While Atlanta and Houston will have wanted more than three wins at this stage.Big storyline - could Chiefs miss the play-offs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Patrick Mahomes was hit a record 15 times in the Chiefs' loss at the Buffalo BillsThey've made the Super Bowl in six of the past seven seasons, winning three, but could the Kansas City Chiefs actually miss out on the play-offs?Their run of nine consecutive AFC West titles is certainly under threat with in-form Denver leading the way and the tough Chargers in second.Patrick Mahomes has improved in recent weeks but losing to the Bills was a big blow, and they now have a bye week off before facing the Broncos in what is verging on a must-win.They have to play Denver twice, the Chargers again and the 7-2 Colts as well, so currently in third in the division and outside of the play-offs as it stands, it's by no means certain they can play their way out of trouble.It's almost unthinkable but a growing possibility.Best division? NFC West set for Sunday showdownIt's all happening out west, as the AFC West has three top teams in along with the NFC West, with the Seahawks, Rams and 49ers all on six wins ahead of a Sunday where all four sides play each other.Arizona go to Seattle after beating the Cowboys and the Rams head to the 49ers for what should be two bone-crunching games.San Francisco have battled away despite big injury problems so you wonder how long that can last, but you wouldn't be surprised if all three of them made the play-offs.Best NFL rookies so farMedia caption, Record-breaking RookiesGiants quarterback Jaxson Dart became the first rookie in NFL history with a touchdown pass and rushing touchdown in four consecutive games on Sunday and continues to thrill with some of his play.He's a great character, a fighter and a leader and could have a great future as the leader of the franchise. He's certainly fun to watch.Bucs wide receiver Emeka Egbuka has been incredibly productive in Tampa Bay, while running backs Ashton Jeanty and Quinshon Judkins have also had fine first half-seasons in the league.Colts tight end Tyler Warren looks to have a great career ahead of him and so far this season only Travis Kelce has more receiving yards at his position.Who are the half-season MVP candidates?Reigning MVP Allen will always be mentioned given his consistency, but the likes of  Maye, Baker Mayfield and even Bo Nix have been mentioned as possibles.Sam Darnold has been magnificent for the Seahawks so has to be up there in the conversation, while his top receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is on pace for the first ever 2,000-yard receiving season in NFL history.Christian McCaffrey has been carrying the 49ers along and looks back to his dual-purpose best - sitting seventh in receiving, ninth in rushing and first in combined yardage. He can also score from anywhere at any time.Jonathan Taylor is the top rusher, second behind McCaffrey in combined yards and has been a touchdown scoring machine - both of those could go close if they replicate this form in the second half of the campaign.NFL play-off picture - as it standsImage caption, The Chiefs are currently outside of the play-off pictureSo as it stands the Chiefs are on the outside looking in, but only a brave man would back against them finding their way in.The Eagles look to have the most comfortable division lead, while the Bills and Patriots will fight it out for the title with the Jets and Dolphins already waving the white flag.Baltimore looking to catch Pittsburgh could be one worth watching while that NFC West battle will be a fascinating watch down the stretch.The Colts may already have a big enough lead in the AFC South but the Packers are not sitting comfortably at all in the tough NFC North.It's all to play for as we head into the second half of the campaign.",

    "body": "'England is the Super League of Europe' - how Premier League is dominating eliteImage source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal have won all four of their games in this season's Champions League without conceding a goalByGary RoseBBC Sport journalistUpdated 6 November 2025 01:49 GMTEnglish clubs appear to be bossing things in Europe as, for the second time in this season's Champions League, five sides from the Premier League won in a single round of fixtures.Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle and Tottenham all won their games this week, with the first four of those sides now sitting inside the top eight - the positions they need to be in to qualify automatically for the knockouts.Only Chelsea failed to take all three points as they were held to a surprising 2-2 draw by Qarabag on Wednesday, but they are still handily placed at the halfway stage of the group stage as they sit 12th.Before this season the Champions League had never seen five teams from one country all win in a single round of matches. Now teams from England have managed it twice.\"In five years' time we will look at this period of the next five years as the domination of England, I don't see it any other way,\" Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague told BBC Sport.\"Bayern are doing really, really well and they can disrupt that. PSG will have their moments, I think Barcelona and Real Madrid are lagging behind, but there is nobody else.\"So following this dominant start, are English teams favourite to win the Champions League? And how likely is a fourth all-English final?Why are English teams doing so well?Arsenal are hoping to win the Champions League for the first time and, while it is still early days, they have made a hugely encouraging start.Themselves, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan are the only sides with a perfect record so far in the league phase, sitting joint top with 12 points from a possible 12.As well as keeping a clean sheet in each of their four games so far they have also scored 11 goals - a scoring record bettered only by Bayern Munich, Paris St-Germain (both 14), Borussia Dortmund (13) and Barcelona (12).Collectively, English teams are outperforming those from other countries, winning 17 of their 24 games, scoring a total of 56 goals - 14 more than any others - and conceding just 17, a record only bettered by teams from France, who have three clubs in the competition compared to six from England.So why are English teams doing so well? A significant factor is the financial muscle they are able to flex compared to teams from the rest of Europe, enabling them to spend more on transfer fees and wages to attract the best talent.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.This summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent this year was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big this summer to increase their strength in depth as they lead the way in the Premier League and sit joint-top of the league standings in the Champions League.\"Obviously in a knockout competition anything can happen but in terms of money, talent, coaching, facilities and even the talent in the offices, England are the super league of Europe,\" Balague added.\"I am not saying this perhaps with the jealousy of Spanish football in general, it is just a reflection of what is happening.\"Could a record number of English clubs progress?This is the first Champions League season to feature six clubs from one nation and history will be made if all six of England's representatives go through.Back in 2017, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed, making England the first country to have five teams in the knockouts of the competition.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.In the final, Liverpool were beaten by Real Madrid.According to Opta's predictions, Arsenal have a 99.8% chance of progressing to the knockouts, with Manchester City on 97.4% and Liverpool on 95.5%.However, the predictions model is a little less confident over the automatic progress of the other three sides with Newcastle on 82%, Chelsea on 80.8% and Tottenham on 72%.Former Liverpool midfielder Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport: \"I'd say at the moment it is [significant what English teams are doing], but it doesn't matter what goes on at the moment because we saw what happened last year, when Liverpool were dominating and finished top of the league stage - and then they were suddenly knocked out by PSG who had been rubbish up until then.\"So I just don't see at the moment, unless you get knocked out, what effect it is going to have and it does not mean the English teams are going to get through the knockout stages because it all depends on the draw, and how you are set up later in the competition.\"Which other teams are doing well?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Bayern Munich's Harry Kane has five goals in four Champions League gamesBayern Munich, led by the in-form Harry Kane, boast a perfect record so far in the league phase.No team has scored more than their 14 goals so far - with Kane accounting for five of those - while they have conceded just three. It is currently mostly the usual suspects occupying the top eight slots - the positions sides need to finish to qualify automatically for the knockouts - with Inter Milan, Paris St-Germain and Real Madrid joining Bayern and the four English sides in those positions.Azerbaijani side Qarabag are showing that money isn't everything after they held Chelsea to a draw on Wednesday and currently have seven points from four games, putting them well on the way to sealing at least a play-off spot.What will likely be needed to reach knockouts?Taking last season - the first to utilise the league phase format - as a barometer for what is needed to finish in the top eight, then around 16 points from the eight games should be sufficient.It means teams are likely going to need to win five of their eight games, which this season's Premier League sides are on course to achieve.There is a lot more leeway to secure a play-off place, which goes to the sides who finish between ninth and 24th. Last season, Club Brugge secured the final qualifying spot for the play-offs, winning just three of their eight games on their way to a total of 11 points.Who has the best chance of going all the way?Media caption, Merino scores twice as Arsenal thrash Slavia PragueIt is still early days but Arsenal's superb start has them rated as the most likely to go all the way and win the competition.Opta predictions give them a 23.4% chance of winning the Champions League, while Manchester City are predicted to be the second most-likely English team to reach the final at 12.5%. Liverpool are third favourites from England with 11.3%.But former Everton midfielder Leon Osman believes the true test of the Premier League teams' capabilities will come in the knockouts.He said: \"It is great [what English teams are currently doing], but it is only when you then get to the knockout stages, where it is literally one team through and one going home, that is the true test and that is when the big-hitters turn up.\"But Osman added that while it is early days, there could be signs that Premier League teams are now getting the balance right between being able to be competitive at home and abroad.\"We have probably expected this [dominance] for years, but it hasn't quite materialised before,\" he said.\"Maybe that is down to the competitiveness of the Premier League, which makes it hard to combine the two, but maybe this year, they are starting to get the balance right.\"What chance is there of an all-English final?Of the 31 seasons of at least one English side in the Champions League, 16 of those campaigns have seen every Premier League representative progress beyond the group stage or first group stage.Of those 16 occasions there have been 11 appearances in the final from English sides, with 2007-08, 2018-19 and 2020-21 having all-English finals.But according to Opta predictions the most likely final at this stage would see an English side face a German side, with Arsenal (38.8%) and Bayern Munich (27.3%) the favourites to get there.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoMaia DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesA record number of referrals were made to the government's anti-terror programme Prevent in the year to March 2025, according to new data.A total of 8,778 referrals were made - up 27% from 6,922 the previous year.The majority of referrals where the concern was specified were made for individuals who had \"no identified ideology\" at 56%. An inquiry into the killing of three children in Southport heard that there had been a sharp rise in Prevent referrals where there were \"concerns about violent fixation\" since the attack in July 2024.Axel Rudakubana, who carried out the killings, had been referred to Prevent three times - but the inquiry heard he had not met the threshold for further intervention because there was no evidence that he had a fixed ideology.The head of Prevent, Michael Stewart, resigned in March after an urgent review found it had closed Rudakabana's case \"prematurely\".The second most-common concern for referrals in the year to March was right-wing ideology at 21%, and then Islamist extremism at 10% - following the same order as the previous year.The latest data showed that children aged 11-15 represented the largest proportion of referrals where the individual's age was known, at 36%.This was followed by children aged 16-17, at 13%. There were also 345 referrals for children younger than 10, representing 4% of the total cases.Around a third of referrals had at least one mental health condition or were neurodiverse, the data also showed.Lord David Anderson KC, the independent Prevent commissioner, said he had heard evidence from across the country of a \"large increase in referrals\" following the publicity of Rudakubana's case. He also cited the TV show Adolescence, released in March 2025, as a possible driver in referrals.Prevent, which forms a key part of the UK's counter-terror strategy, places a legal duty on public bodies - including schools and the police - to identify people who may turn to extremism.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe UK is facing a long, drawn-out flu season, the boss of the NHS in England is warning.Sir Jim Mackey said there is \"no doubt\" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced.It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected.NHS England is issuing a \"flu jab SOS\", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it.More than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter.Sir Jim said: \"There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced.\"Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night. And, unfortunately, it looks like that fear is becoming reality.\"Australia has just endured its worst flu season on record — over 410,000 cases — and all the signs suggest the NHS will face similar challenges in the months ahead. From December through to March, our hospitals will be at capacity.\"How to get a flu shotPeople aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS. Appointments can be booked online, by phoning 119 or at local pharmacies and GPs.Children aged two to 16 can also get vaccinated with a nasal spray. That's mainly to help stop flu spreading.Other people can buy a flu vaccine from high street chemist shops and some supermarket pharmacies. Bad winter predictedTwo of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions were lifted combined with immunity being low.Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.Flu rates are currently three times higher than normal for this time of year, with the highest rates seen in children and young people. But health officials have warned the virus will start spreading to older groups in the coming weeks.Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said: \"With just weeks left to ensure best protection against the worst of the flu season, we are issuing an urgent SOS to the eligible people who have yet to get jabbed this year.\"It is vital that the public use the available appointments we have running next week to stamp out this early wave of flu cases and help shield themselves ahead of winter.\"The vaccine is proven to be safe and help prevent those at risk from getting seriously ill and even hospitalised from flu.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJames CookScotland editor Getty ImagesNew land reform legislation has been approved by the Scottish ParliamentThe question \"who owns Scotland?\" stirs up strong emotions.This is not just about land. It deals with people, profit - and where power lies.Scotland is unusual because it has one of the most concentrated patterns of land ownership anywhere in the western world.Land reformers calculate that 421 individuals, corporations, asset management groups and foreign trusts own more than 40% of all the nation's rural land.\"It's shocking,\" said Dr Josh Doble, the director of policy and advocacy at Community Land Scotland.\"We are an international anomaly.\"Getty ImagesThe Knoydart peninsula can only be reached by boat or a two-day hikeLawmakers have been grappling with this issue for a long time but the pace of change has picked up since devolution in 1999.The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill is the Scottish government's latest wide-ranging and controversial attempt to tackle the issue.It aims to make community buy-outs easier, to provide tenants with more information about the management of their land, and to give ministers the power to break up some large estates at the point of sale.SNP ministers say the law gives a voice to the voiceless, handing communities a greater say over their futures.Opponents have called it an unworkable and unprecedented assault on private property rights. There has even been talk of \"class war\".Sarah-Jane Laing of Scottish Land and Estates, which represents many large landowners, says the provisions within the act are being \"driven by ideology\".She claims the Scottish government \"want to see fragmentation and break up of estates as an end in itself\" - an aim Ms Laing describes as \"really damaging for people, jobs and nature\".Stephanie Harris says Knoydart has gone from strength to strengthThe debate has its roots in the profit-driven clearances of the 18th and 19th centuries when landowners drove people from their estates to make way for sheep and cattle.They know all about that in Knoydart in the west Highlands, a rugged peninsula accessible only by boat or a two-day hike.In the 1850s, hundreds of Highlanders were violently evicted from Knoydart. Many were forced to emigrate to Canada.It was one of the events which led to a public inquiry into conditions in the Highlands and, in 1886, to Scotland's first major land reform.The Crofters Holdings Act was enacted by William Gladstone's Liberal government and granted security of tenure to small-scale tenant farmers known as crofters.These days Knoydart is under community ownership. In 1999 locals bought up much of the land where they lived and worked and they now say the area is thriving.Getty ImagesThe Old Forge in Inverie is the most remote pub on the British mainlandThe peninsula is home to Great Britain's most remote pub, The Old Forge in Inverie, which is run by Stephanie Harris.She told us that Knoydart had gone from strength to strength over the past 25 years.\"There's lots more people live here, there's lots of kids here now, there's more private businesses and community enterprises going,\" she explained.\"There's a lot more opportunities and the fact people still want to come here I think is showing that it's working.\"Davie Newton was instrumental in much of that change, building and renovating a pub, shop, village hall and more while also helping to run the Knoydart Foundation which manages the land.He said community ownership had led to the planting of 600,000 trees, the revitalisation of a hydro-electric scheme and the building of many new homes.\"As the community makes decisions over its own future, it gains confidence by making decisions and getting them right, it gains experience by making decisions and getting them wrong,\" he said.The new Land Reform Bill aims to make it easier for other communities to follow in Knoydart's footsteps.Local residents say there are now more opportunities in KnoydartBut clauses which will hand ministers powers to force the break-up of some big estates are deplored by many landowners and their representatives.Sarah-Jane Laing said it was not true to say that \"big is bad\" when it comes to Scottish estates.\"It's almost impossible to deliver some of the peatland restoration, the river restoration - alongside building houses, bringing forward renewables, creating businesses - unless you have scale of ownership,\" she said.Scotland's biggest private landowner is the Danish billionaire Anders Povlsen who is well known for his interest in \"rewilding\".Ms Laing met us at a more modest but still fairly large landholding – Preston Hall Farm in Midlothian to demonstrate her point – that big can in fact be good.Will Callander has diversified his farming business at Preston Hall in MidlothianThe 650-hectare estate is home to a range of enterprises, from coffee roasters to picture framers to a pottery studio.\"It's the variety of things that are going on which makes it exciting to manage and run,\" said the landowner, Will Callander.\"To be blunt, we are not making big sums of money. We're not sitting here driving fast cars and living the high life.\"We live here, we work here, and we want to be surrounded by fun, exciting, happy people.\"Mr Callander has concerns about the latest land reform legislation which has already generated some talk of legal action to challenge some of its provisions.\"Certainty is what we need,\" he said.The new bill was supported by Labour and the Liberal Democrats but the Conservatives voted against, calling it unworkable and devastating.The Scottish Greens abstained, saying it fell far short of what Scotland needed – and accusing the SNP of failing to stand up to landed elites.Dr Josh Doble of Community Land Scotland wants more radical reformMany land reform campaigners agree with the call for more radical reform.Dr Josh Doble said Scotland had a rural housing crisis, growing inequality, depleted biodiversity and limited economic opportunities for local people.\"All of that stems back to the fact that we have a very small number of people who control what happens in those areas,\" he argued.\"If we had a much more democratic and equitable way in which land was shared amongst people, we would start to address those issues in an actually meaningful way.\"Like many claims in this debate, that is hotly disputed.Hundreds of years after they began, battles over land reform look set to rage on in 21st century Scotland.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondent and Michael Sheils McNamee,Business reporterDrivers of electric vehicles (EVs) could face the prospect of a new tax in this month's Budget.With pressure on the chancellor to find tens of billions of pounds in additional revenue, the BBC understands there have been \"conversations\" within government about the possibility of a new levy on EVs.A government spokesperson told the BBC: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"The statement follows a report in the Daily Telegraph that the Budget would include a new pay-per-mile charge for electric vehicles from 2028, following a consultation. According to the Telegraph, EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh. Drivers of hybrid cars would also be charged, but at a lower rate.The paper says the idea is that owners would have to estimate, and pay for, their road usage for the year ahead. If, at the end of the year, they had driven fewer miles they would have a credit to carry over, but if they had driven more they would face a top-up charge.Drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles pay fuel duty, so the transition to electric vehicles leaves a shortfall in government revenues, which are already under significant pressure.Since April of this year, electric cars stopped being exempt from vehicle excise duty, due to a change made in the 2022 Budget. \"We want a fairer system for all drivers whilst backing the transition to electric vehicles,\" a government spokesperson told the BBC. \"It is right to seek a tax system that fairly funds roads, infrastructure and public services,\" they added.However, the government was still backing the transition away from petrol and diesel, they said, pointing to £4bn in support already given, including grants to cut upfront costs by up to £3,750 per eligible vehicle.\"We will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable,\" they said.Shadow chancellor Mel Stride disagreed with the plan to tax EV drivers and said now was not the time for \"another tax raid\".\"It would be wrong for Rachel Reeves to target commuters and car owners in this way just to help fill a black hole she has created in the public finances,\" the Conservative MP said.There has been growing concerns about the emerging \"tax gap\" from more petrol and diesel cars coming off the roads. That has put pay-per-mile systems in the spotlight, but there has been push back from some quarters. Edmund King, AA president, said while the government was losing fuel duty revenue, it should \"tread carefully unless their actions slow down the transition to EVs\". He added car sales indicated that the government's own zero emissions target would not be met this year, and the detail of the proposal was needed \"to ascertain whether these new taxes will be equitable or a poll tax on wheels\".Car-selling platform Autotrader said the government needed \"to use more carrot and less stick\" regarding take-up of EVs.Its chief executive Nathan Coe said any introduction of pay-per-mile taxes on EVs would increase their running costs, so was likely to affect demand. \"At the moment, one of the big differences is that whilst EVs do cost a little bit more up front, they are much cheaper to run. This kind of takes some of that benefit away.\"A corresponding increase to fuel duty, that would hit petrol and diesel vehicle owners would \"obviously help\" uptake of EVs, Mr Coe said.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLana LamSydneyPeter MumbyThe Great Barrier Reef has suffered mass bleaching events in recent yearsThe Great Barrier Reef is headed for a \"grim future\" and will suffer a \"rapid coral decline\" by 2050 but parts may recover if global warming is kept below 2C, a new study has found.Researchers at the University of Queensland (UQ) used modelling to simulate the lifecycles of certain coral species and found that some were better at adapting to warmer oceans and could help new coral grow.Reefs near cooler-water currents were also more resilient, giving a \"glimmer of hope\" to the natural wonder, which has suffered severe climate-induced heat stress in recent years.The study warned that curbing carbon emissions was crucial to allow coral to recover and avoid a \"near collapse\" of the reef.Dr Yves-Marie Bozec, who led the research, said the modelling of more than 3,800 individual reefs that make up the Great Barrier Reef looked at their \"eco-evolutionary dynamics\". This included how corals interact with each other, how they deal with warmer water and corals in naturally cooler areas.\"We ran all of those factors with the most up-to-date climate projections - and the news was not good,\" he said.\"We forecast a rapid coral decline before the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario.\"The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems, stretching more than 2,300km (1,400 miles) off Australia's north-east coast.It has suffered four significant marine heatwaves between 2016 and 2022, causing much of its coral to expel the algae which gives them life and colour - a process called bleaching, which is often fatal.A recent report found that parts of the Great Barrier Reef had suffered the largest annual decline in coral cover since records began nearly 40 years ago.Dr Bozec said some parts of the reef \"may partially recover after 2050, but only if ocean warming is sufficiently slow to allow natural adaptation to keep pace with temperature changes\".\"Adaptation may keep pace if global warming does not exceed two degrees by 2100. For that to happen, more action is needed globally to reduce carbon emissions which are driving climate change.\"Dr Bozec said: \"The window for meaningful action is closing rapidly but it hasn't shut\".Under the Paris agreement, almost 200 nations have pledged to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C and to keep them \"well below\" 2C above those recorded in pre-industrial times, generally considered to mean the late 19th Century.Prof Peter Mumby, who also worked on the study, said they found \"many reefs could persist under the Paris agreement target of two degrees of warming\".\"However, higher emissions leading to faster temperature rises would drive most reefs to a near collapse,\" he said. Prof Murphy said reefs in areas \"where the water doesn't heat up so dramatically because it is well mixed, fared better than others\" and reefs close to populations of corals that can regenerate were also healthier.Identifying areas of the reef network that are more resilient will mean efforts to protect the reef can focus on \"strategic parts\" of the ecosystem, he added.Watch: Can you un-bleach coral?

    "body": "15 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorLast week, after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison, Justice Secretary David Lammy said he was implementing the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\".However, since then, details have emerged of two more prisoners being wrongly let out.It is always perilous for a government when it clearly lacks grip on an issue voters would reasonably expect it to be in control of.The stand out example of this in recent years has been the arrival of migrants on small boats.From Rishi Sunak's promise to \"stop the boats\" to Sir Keir Starmer's promise to \"smash the gangs\" both have been found wanting and the problem remains huge.Now the government confronts another example: a justice system that is palpably, transparently and repeatedly failing – and where measures designed to address the issue of letting prisoners out by accident aren't working.According to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March of this year - a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.In other words, it has been a problem for some time, and it is getting worse.And, context is everything in politics: this row now comes after the mistaken release of perhaps the most high-profile prisoner jailed this year.Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping in Essex, only to be let out by accident. He has since been deported.It gave the issue of accidental releases from prison a salience and prominence it hadn't had until then.Once again, we are seeing ministers use the language we usually see from opposition politicians.The Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described the number of people arriving on small boats as \"shameful\".Now, the Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy is saying he is \"absolutely outraged\" over the mistaken release a week ago of Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, a 24-year-old Algerian sex offender.Lammy added that his officials have been \"working through the night to take him back to prison.\"Which brings us to the messy genesis of this saga, at B-Team Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday lunchtime.With the prime minister at the COP climate summit in Brazil, it was his deputy who was answering questions.The Conservatives put up the shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge, who repeated a question, using a very particular form of words, over and over again.He wanted to know if an \"asylum-seeking offender had been accidentally released from prison\".It was obvious from the Press Gallery that Cartlidge was on to something – because of the apparent precision of his language and his constant repetition of the question.But Lammy chose to repeatedly duck the question, despite, we later learnt, knowing about the case Cartlidge was referring to.So why didn't he address it?It turns out Cartlidge had got his facts wrong - Kaddour-Cherif isn't an asylum seeker. He arrived here legally but then stayed after his visa expired.Lammy wasn't certain on entering the chamber whether he was an asylum seeker or not.So setting out what he knew might also have exposed what he didn't.His team insist \"it is incredibly important to know the facts\" and they argue it was for the police in the first instance to do that publicly.Really? It seems reasonable to ask both whether Lammy could or should have known more when he arrived in the chamber and whether he could or should have disclosed more when he was there.The Conservatives later called for him to return to the Commons to set out what he knew. The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith suggested he may have misled the Commons. The Liberal Democrats and Reform have been very critical too.Some also suggest Lammy's manner – shouting \"get a grip, man!\" at Cartlidge, among other things – was a mistake.Could he instead have chosen to set out what he did and didn't know about the case at the beginning of the exchanges, before he took any questions?But it is the bigger picture here that really matters: the justice system is currently repeatedly failing in that most basic of its tasks – who should be in prison and who shouldn't.The reasons for that are complex – with difficult questions for the courts, individual prisons, the Prison Service, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.It is not a new problem, but it is a growing one, and one the government doesn't have a grip on. And that, if you are the justice secretary, is a problem.",

    "body": "18 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, GazaWatch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitFrom an embankment overlooking Gaza City, there's no hiding what this war has done.The Gaza of maps and memories is gone, replaced by a monochrome landscape of rubble stretching flat and still for 180 degrees, from Beit Hanoun on one side to Gaza City on the other.Beyond the distant shapes of buildings still standing inside Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.This was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered in the early weeks of the war. Since then they have been back multiple times, as Hamas regrouped around its strongholds in the area.Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.The remains of Shejaiya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza CityAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said. \"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child. That's what happened on October 7.\"More than 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and 251 others taken hostage.Since then, more than 68,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there.The bodies of several hostages had been found in this area, Lt Col Shoshani said, including that of Itay Chen, returned to Israel by Hamas this week. Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.The Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.Israel's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians. There are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.EPAHamas fighters pictured on Wednesday in Gaza City (image brightened for clarity)The ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.Col Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"Moose Campbell/ BBCBuildings in Gaza City have been reduced to grey, dusty rubble (image brightened for clarity)The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.What happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.The agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.The US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.Largely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands.More on the Israel-Gaza war",

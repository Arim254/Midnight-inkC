    "body": "5 hours agoHarry LowLondonEPAThe Met says it has solved three child sexual exploitation cases in the last 12 monthsNine thousand cases of child sexual exploitation are being reviewed by the Metropolitan Police, the force has confirmed.In a statement, the Met said it was reinvestigating the cases which involve \"intra-familial, peer-on-peer and in institutional settings, along with those which do not fit the common understanding of a 'grooming gang'\".The cases are being re-examined following a national review into group-based child sexual exploitation which found it was more widespread, organised, and underreported than previously acknowledged.The force said it took all \"allegations or concerns about child sexual exploitation and child criminal exploitation incredibly seriously\".Baroness Casey's report, the National Audit on Group-based Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, also found a \"mismatch\" in the way the way the Metropolitan Police and local authorities record child abuse.Published in June, it found the ethnicity of people involved had been \"shied away from\" by authorities.On Saturday, Scotland Yard said group-based offending was \"particularly insidious and devastating in its profound impact on the children affected\".In a statement, the force added: \"Since 2022, there have been significant improvements to how the Met identifies and investigates group-based offending, including training for 11,000 frontline officers and the expansion of our child exploitation teams. \"In the last year we have solved three times more cases of child sexual exploitation – representing 134 more suspects charged.\"Our commitment to safeguarding all victims of such terrible offences and bringing those responsible to justice is absolute.\"'Woefully let down'The cases the force is now reviewing cover a 15-year period, which the Met said was the same time period covered by Baroness Casey's report.A spokesperson for Sir Sadiq Khan said the information had been published because \"the mayor demanded full transparency and has consistently asked the Met to leave no stone unturned when investigating these appalling crimes\".The spokesperson added: \"Any individuals or gangs exploiting children for sex are utterly abhorrent. \"Sadiq is quite clear that they must face the full force of the law. \"These children have not only suffered terrible abuse at the hands of the perpetrators but have been woefully let down by the authorities meant to protect them from harm.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Parents are being urged to get their children vaccinated against flu over half-term as the NHS warned of rising cases of the disease.There is an early flu season, health officials say, and the latest data for England showed cases and hospitalisations were increasing.NHS England said many school children will have already received the vaccine at school but there are still options for those who have not, including pop-up clinics.GP surgeries can give flu vaccines to school-aged children with certain health conditions, as well as two to three year olds, while preschoolers can also be taken to pharmacies for the vaccine.Most children are offered the vaccine in a nasal spray rather than an injection.NHS England's weekly flu and Covid surveillance report said there was increased flu activity \"particularly among children\".Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said it was concerning that the flu had hit early this year and the increase among children was \"worrying\".\"Flu can spread like wildfire across schools and can make children really unwell,\" he said.\"The virus changes each year, so vaccination remains the best way to shield your child from getting seriously ill.\"He urged parents to make sure they had opted their child in for an in-school vaccine or find their nearest clinic.Pop-up clinics were being held in places like bowling alleys and fire stations, Mr Burton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the vaccine was \"quick, easy and safe\".Dr Fari Ahmad told BBC Breakfast that while she was seeing cases, \"I don't think we've quite hit the peak yet\".\"With flu, this is a war we have every year. Flu is unpredictable, it still kills people and every year we try to get enough people vaccinated so that when the big surge comes we are not decimated,\" she said. Dr Ahmad said that getting enough school-age children vaccinated meant that it made that surge better, \"because they are spreaders\".\"It will be great for the kids individually but it will also be better for all of us,\" she said.NHS England said more than 10 million vaccines have already been delivered in the latest campaign, including to almost 1.5 million school-aged children and more than 300,000 eligible two and three year olds.Free vaccines are available to those older than 65, with certain long-term health conditions, are pregnant, live in a care home, the main carer for an older or disabled person or live with someone who has a weakened immune system.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship7 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela, saying earlier this week that the US is \"looking at land now\" after getting \"the sea very well under control\".\"We stopped all drugs from coming in by sea. I will stop all drugs from coming in by land very shortly. You'll see that starting,\" he told reporters at the White House on Saturday before departing for a trip to Asia.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "21 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterGetty ImagesIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth almost £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.Ruth Clegg/BBCMillions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small, white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now? Why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.Katie CurranKatie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughtsFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Getty ImagesSeeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesiumTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "Connolly declared president of Ireland after landslide win13 minutes agoAuryn CoxBBC News NICatherine Connolly: \"I will be an inclusive president for all\"Catherine Connolly has been elected as the president of Ireland after a landslide victory.She has become the 10th president of the Republic of Ireland after defeating Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, who had already conceded to her rival.The result, long clear from early tallies, was officially declared at Dublin Castle.Connolly – an independent who was backed by the major left-wing parties – pledged to be \"an inclusive president for all\" in her acceptance speech.The 68-year-old, from Galway, has been a TD (member of the Irish parliament) since 2016.She will be the country's 10th president, taking over from Michael D Higgins who has served the maximum two terms in officeConnolly secured 914,143 first preference votes (63%), the largest amount in Irish presidential election history. She made her acceptance speech first in Irish and then in English.\"I will be a president who listens and reflects and who speaks when it's necessary,\" she said.\"I will be a voice for peace, a voice that builds on our policy of neutrality, a voice that articulates the existential threat posed by climate change, and a voice that recognises the tremendous work being done the length and breadth of the country.\"Dublin correspondent Gabija Gataveckaite said Connolly was the anti-establishment candidate who took on Humphreys, the government's pick.She said in recent weeks, Connolly had been insisting her campaign was a \"movement\" and she has now won a clear mandate from the people.ReutersHeather Humphreys shook hands with Catherine Connolly, whose family joined her on the stageHumphreys, who spoke after Connolly, thanked everyone who voted for her, her campaign team and Fine Gael for the nomination.\"I know Catherine will be a president for all of us. Catherine will be my president and I want to wish her well, this is her evening,\" she said.The president of Ireland is the country's head of state. They represent the country abroad, take centre stage at major national events, and are responsible for ensuring that the constitution – the set of rules for government and politics - is followed.While the president's powers are limited, the office-holder's influence can be profound.Connolly will be inaugurated on 11 November with Higgins leaving office the day before.'Woman with a very independent mind'Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin said an \"outstanding honour\" had been bestowed upon Connolly.\"The people have spoken resoundingly and given Catherine a tremendous majority and a very clear mandate,\" he said.Tánaiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Harris said: \"The great thing about this country is that we live in enduring democracy.\"We have an election, we go at it hammer and tongs and then we come together proudly behind the winner of the election.\"Earlier he acknowledged the high level of spoiled votes, saying he saw \"people going to quite a lot of effort to spoil their ballot\".Sinn Féin, the main opposition party in the Irish parliament, gave its support to Connolly after deciding not to run its own candidate.The party's president Mary Lou McDonald described the result as a \"stunning victory\" and said Connolly needed the support of her party in the presidential election campaign.Speaking at Dublin Castle on Saturday, Ms McDonald said: \"It is a victory for the combined opposition over the jaded worn-out politics of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael.\"Sinn Féin as the largest political party, of course it was a significant element of the campaign.\"And Catherine has asserted quite correctly that she is an independent candidate, a woman with a very independent mind.\"Connolly sought out to establish herself as a united Ireland candidate and said she would like to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her presidency, which runs for seven years.In Northern Ireland, First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the win marked \"an era of hope\".\"This election has shown what can be achieved when parties committed to change and progress work together in common purpose,\" she said.\"That is the clear pathway to a better, united future.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaLucy Powell has been elected as Labour's new deputy leader after a race triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation last month.The Manchester Central MP defeated Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson by promising to give grassroots members a louder voice and push for a \"course correction\" in government.She was sacked from the cabinet in September and drew support from members who are dissatisfied with the direction of the government under Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Powell took 87,407 votes, nearly 14,000 votes ahead of Phillipson, on a turnout of 16.6%.During her victory speech she said the party needed to be \"bolder\" and promised to be a \"champion for our Labour values\".She said she would \"help Keir and our government to succeed\" but said the party \"must change how we are doing things to turn things around\".Powell said she would use her role to \"bring voices\" who believe the government is not being bold enough \"to the heart of our party\".\"I'll be a champion for our Labour values and boldness in everything we do, and I know that you Keir, as our leader, want that - and I will be your ally in that fight,\" she said.Powell also singled out Reform UK, saying it \"starts with us wrestling back the political megaphone and setting the agenda more strongly, because let's be honest we've let [Nigel] Farage and his ilk run away with it\".She said the party could not win support by \"trying to 'out-Reform' Reform\".PA MediaPowell's victory comes after a week in which the government has faced questions over the grooming gangs inquiry and the mistaken release of a migrant sex offender from prison.It also saw Labour beaten in a Senedd by-election in Caerphilly, a seat the party had held for a century.The prime minister said he accepted the party had suffered a \"bad result\" in Wales, describing it as a \"reminder that people need to look out their window and see change and renewal in their community, opportunities for their children, public services rebuilt, the cost of living crisis tackled\".Labour must now \"unite\" and \"keep our focus on what is, in my view, the defining battle for the soul of our nation\", he added.Phillipson congratulated Powell on her victory in a statement, though said she was \"obviously disappointed at today's result\".She said it was \"crucial that our party now comes together to take the fight to Reform in next year's crucial Senedd, Holyrood and local elections\".The race to be Labour deputy leader began with six candidates but the field was quickly reduced to two, with Phillipson widely seen as the leadership's preferred candidate.The education secretary gained an early lead when the election campaign first got under way, securing more MPs and union endorsements, but Powell gained ground by winning support from constituency parties.She was endorsed by figures who have been publicly critical of the Labour leadership, like Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.Powell and Phillipson served in cabinet together and are seen as being close politically - but while the race was largely collegiate, it erupted at points into accusations of \"mud-slinging\" and sexist briefings.Hustings at Labour's conference highlighted a divide in approach: Phillipson warned against \"division and disunity\", while Powell insisted Labour leaders needed to listen to a wider range of voices to avoid political missteps.In June, the government was forced into a U-turn over cuts to welfare spending, which Powell blamed on the failure of Starmer's team to listen to MPs.During the campaign, Powell frequently referred to \"mistakes\" made by the party on issues such as the winter fuel allowance.Powell's victory was widely expected but while a winning margin of 54% to 46% was clear, it was not overwhelming, suggesting Labour members have not entirely rejected Sir Keir's leadership.The low 16.6% turnout is also stark, but without a breakdown of membership it's hard to draw conclusions.That is partly because while many people join Labour individually, some are eligible to vote via their trade union membership, and may not be engaged with internal party races.The union Unite declared that neither candidate was worthy of support so it would be unsurprising if some of their members sat on their hands.PA MediaThe election was triggered by Rayner's dramatic resignation after admitting to underpaying tax on a house purchase.While relations between Sir Keir and Rayner had been tense at times, she was seen as a key figure in government. She held the title deputy prime minister and was seen as a political bridge between the leadership and the party's traditional working class and union base.But last month's reshuffle left the deputy leadership as a purely party role after Sir Keir appointed David Lammy as deputy prime minister and placed key allies in other cabinet roles.However, Powell will sit on Labour's powerful National Executive Committee and act as the party's \"campaigner-in-chief.\" Previous holders of the role have sought to unite the party's factions but differences of opinion with leaders have also led to divisions. Under Sir Tony Blair, John Prescott became a link to Labour's party faithful and the pair had a close relationship - while Tom Watson, on the other hand, clashed with Jeremy Corbyn.Whether Powell's election strengthens Labour's campaign machine or deepens internal strains could shape the party's fortunes over a critical few months for the party.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is weeks away from delivering a much-anticipated Budget, where she is expected to raise taxes.The party is also only six months away from a difficult set of council elections in England, and elections in Scotland and Wales, where Powell will play a key role in rallying activists.",

    "body": "A suspect has been arrested after footage which appears to capture the alleged attempted rape of a woman on a train near Paris went viral, local media say. Jhordana Dias, a 26-year-old Brazilian national, was allegedly attacked earlier this month. She told Le Parisien newspaper that the man boarded the train, pushed her and attempted to pull down her underwear. Alerted by her screams, another passenger pulled out her phone to film. The  footage captures a man fleeing as the train pulls into a station. The incident has revived discussions around women's safety in France.According to French media, a man was arrested on Friday evening by transport police in Mantes-la-Jolie, north-west of Paris. He was traced there by investigators, but it is unclear how.He was not carrying identity documentation at the time of his arrest, but told police he was a 26-year-old Egyptian national, media reports say. He remains in custody.The alleged incident took place on 15 October between the Choisy-le-Roi and Villeneuve-le-Roi train stations, south-east of Paris.The video shows shows a man dressed in a black tracksuit and cap onboard a carriage.Over the sound of a woman's cries, the woman filming can be heard saying \"you stay there\" as the man appears to begin approaching her.The train then pulls into a station, and the man disembarks and flees down the platform.The woman who filmed the incident, named in French media only as Marguerite, has since been widely credited as having saved Ms Dias from a more serious attack.Ms Dias, who does not speak French, reportedly filed a complaint with police in Choisy-le-Roi with the help of her brother, who translated her testimony.The footage has been widely circulated on news outlets and social media. prompting many women to share their own experiences of harassment on public transport in France.Two other women have since told Le Parisian that they had been victims of the same man.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThomas Mackintosh and Ruth ComerfordWatch: Met Police Commander James Conway urges Kebatu to give himself upThe Metropolitan Police has issued a direct appeal to a migrant sex offender to hand himself in, after he was mistakenly released from a prison in Essex on Friday and travelled to east London.Hadush Kebatu was set free weeks after being jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex, while staying in a hotel.Cmd James Conway said on Saturday the force was \"pursuing all lines of enquiry\" into his disappearance, adding that Kebatu had access to funds and had sought assistance from members of the public.He has made a number of train journeys across London since he boarded a train at 12:41 on Friday afternoon, before getting off at Stratford, Conway added.In a direct appeal to Kebatu, Conway said: \"We want to locate you in a safe and controlled way. You had already indicated a desire to return to Ethiopia when speaking to immigration staff.\"\"The best outcome for you is to make contact directly with us by either calling 999 or reporting yourself to a police station.\"Kebatu left prison wearing a prison-issued grey tracksuit, holding a clear plastic bag containing his possessions, the Met said. A Sexual Harm Prevention Order was made against him, when he was sentenced in September, on the grounds the judge agreed he posed a risk of sexual harm to female adults and children.Earlier, Essex Police - who handed the lead of investigation to the Met at 11:30 on Saturday morning - said: \"It is not lost on us that this situation is concerning to people, and we are committed to locating and arresting him as quickly as possible.\"It is not clear exactly what led to his release, but prison sources have told the BBC prison staff from HMP Chelmsford lead Kebatu away from the prison and towards the train station. A prison officer from HMP Chelmsford has been suspended, but a senior prison staffer said the error was \"down to a series of mistakes, probably because staff are overworked and in short supply.\"\"It's not just one prison officer who's to blame. That would be unfair,\" they added. The search for Kebatu began at 12:57 on Friday after Essex Police were informed by the Prison Service that there had been \"an error\".The train Kebatu boarded at Chelmsford station stopped at Stratford at 13:10, where the Met Police say he then disembarked.Stratford is the UK's fifth busiest train station, with interchanges to the London Underground, London Overground and Dockland's Light Railway (DLR).Sir Keir Starmer previously described the release as \"totally unacceptable\" and said Kebatu \"must be caught and deported for his crimes\".Essex PoliceHadush Kebatu posed a \"significant risk of reoffending\", the judge said during sentencingJohn Podmore - a former governor of HMP Brixton, Belmarsh and Swaleside, and a former prison inspector - said the error should be seen \"in the context of wider faiure,\" adding he hoped a \"lower down official is not thrown under the bus\".\"I am afraid this is what happens in a broken system and the prison system is broken,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\"Footage shared on social media appeared to show Kebatu in a prison-issue tracksuit with a bag of belongings on Chelmsford high streetDeputy Prime Minister David Lammy said he was \"appalled\" and \"livid on behalf of the public\".He continued: \"Let's be clear Kebatu committed a nasty sexual assault involving a young child and a woman. And for those reasons this of course is very serious.\"A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"We are urgently working with police to return an offender to custody following a release in error at HMP Chelmsford.\"Public protection is our top priority, and we have launched an investigation into this incident.\"Watch: Bodycam footage shows Hadush Kebatu's arrestKebatu's arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living after arriving in the UK on a small boat.In September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work. During the trial, Kebatu gave his date of birth as December 1986, making him 38, but court records suggested he was 41.He was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months. He was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10  years.The court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.It is not clear where Kebatu was being deported to but under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.Kebatu was arrested on 8 July and was released in error 108 days later. Upon his release he would have been eligible for a £76 discharge payment.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said the release was a \"level of incompetence that beggars belief\".\"Conservatives voted against Labour's prisoner release program because it was putting predators back on our streets,\" she said on X. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"He is now walking the streets of Essex. Britain is broken.\"A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.",

    "body": "15 hours agoYolande Knell and Jacob Evans,in JerusalemBBCThree year-old Zain Tafesh died from leukemia earlier this weekSo many lives in Gaza still hang in the balance.In different wards of Nasser Hospital lie two 10-year-old boys, one shot by Israeli fire and paralysed from the neck down, another with a brain tumour.Now that a fragile ceasefire is in place, they are among some 15,000 patients who the World Health Organization (WHO) says are in need of urgent medical evacuations.Amar Abu Said is paralysed from the neck and needs specialist treatmentOla Abu Said sits gently stroking the hair of her son, Amar.  His family says he was in their tent in southern Gaza when he was hit by a stray bullet fired by an Israeli drone.  It is lodged between two of his vertebrae, leaving him paralysed.\"He needs surgery urgently,\" Ola says, \"but it's complicated.  Doctors told us it could cause his death, a stroke or brain haemorrhage.  He needs surgery in a well-equipped place.\"Right now, Gaza is anything but that.  After two years of war, its hospitals have been left in a critical state.Ahmed al-Jadd and his sister Shahd lost their father in the warSitting by the bedside of her younger brother, Ahmed al-Jadd, his sister Shahd says her brother was a constant comfort to her through two years of war and displacement.\"He's only 10 and, when our situation got so bad, he used to go out and sell water to help bring some money for us,\" she says.  A few months ago, he showed the first signs of ill health.\"Ahmad's mouth started drooping to one side,\" Shahd explains. \"One time he kept telling me, 'Shahd my head hurts', and we just gave him paracetamol, but later, his right hand stopped moving.\"The one-time university student is desperate for her brother to travel abroad to have his tumour removed.\"We can't lose him. We already lost our father, our home and our dreams,\" Shahd says. \"When the ceasefire happened it gave us a bit of a hope that maybe there was a 1% chance that Ahmed could travel and get treated.\"ReutersInternational agencies are desperate to increase the number of evacuationsOn Wednesday, the WHO co-ordinated the first medical convoy to exit Gaza since the fragile ceasefire began on 10 October.  It took 41 patients and 145 carers to hospitals abroad via Israel's Kerem Shalom crossing, with ambulances and buses taking the group on to Jordan.  Some have stayed for care there.The UN agency has called for numbers of medical evacuations to be rapidly increased to deal with the thousands of cases of sick and wounded.  It wants to be able to bring out patients through Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt as it has done previously.However, Israel has said it is keeping the crossing closed until Hamas \"fulfils\" its commitments under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal by returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Israel has kept the Gaza side of the Egyptian border closed since May 2024 when it took control during the war.Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, the head of the WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said \"the most impactful measure\" would be if Israel could allow Gazan patients to be treated in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as happened before the war.Top EU officials and foreign ministers of more than 20 countries - including the UK - have previously called for this, offering \"financial contributions, provision of medical staff or equipment needed\".A funeral was held for eight-year old Saadi Abu Taha who died this week from stomach cancer\"Hundreds of patients could be treated easily and efficiently in a short time if this route reopened to the East Jerusalem Hospital Network and the hospitals in the West Bank,\" says Dr Fadi Atrash, CEO of the Augusta Victoria Hospital on the Mount of Olives.\"We can at least treat 50 patients per day for chemotherapy and radiation and even more than that.  Other hospitals can do a lot of surgeries,\" the doctor told me.\"Referring them to East Jerusalem is the shortest distance, the most efficient way, because we have the mechanism. We speak the same language, we're the same culture, in many cases we have medical files for Gazan patients.  They've been receiving treatment in East Jerusalem hospitals for more than a decade before the war.\"The BBC asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's crossings, why the medical route was not being approved.  Cogat said it was a decision by the political echelon and referred queries to the prime minister's office, which did not offer further explanation.After the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023, Israel cited security reasons for not allowing Gazan patients in other Palestinian territories.  It also pointed out that its main crossing point for people at Erez had been targeted by Hamas fighters during the assault.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says that in the year to August 2025, at least 740 people, including nearly 140 children, died while on waiting lists.At Nasser hospital, the director of paediatrics and maternity, Dr Ahmed al-Farra, expresses his frustration.\"It's the most difficult feeling for a doctor to be present, able to diagnose a condition but unable to carry out essential tests and lacking the necessary treatments,\" Dr al-Farra says. \"This has happened in so many cases, and unfortunately, there's daily loss of life due to our lack of capabilities.\"Since the ceasefire, hope has run out for more of his patients.In the past week in the hospital grounds, a funeral took place for Saadi Abu Taha, aged eight, who died from intestinal cancer.A day later, three-year old Zain Tafesh and Luay Dweik, aged eight, died from hepatitis.Without action, there are many more Gazans who will not have a chance to live in peace.",

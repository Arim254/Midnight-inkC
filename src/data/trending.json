    "body": "Jeremy Doku was absolutely brilliant for Manchester City in their 3-0 win on Sunday, but Liverpool's tactics were the reason he was able to run riot down their right.Without Mohamed Salah tracking back, Arne Slot's side were always so vulnerable down that flank and I felt sorry for Conor Bradley, who was trying to stop Doku but had Nico O'Reilly to worry about too.Even if Liverpool had found some better balance, and had a winger who gave Bradley more defensive support or condensed City's space, then with the way Doku was playing he would still have been almost impossible to stop.Doku was a pleasure to watch, irrespective of who you support and who you wanted to win. You had to admire his skill, pace, strength and bravery - and his goal was just amazing.The way Liverpool were set up, though, actually helped him shine.He was electric and the game's star man. This was the best I've seen him play in a City shirt, but Salah not being asked to defend made it so easy for him.It became a really productive area of the pitch for City, and was one of the reasons they won so comfortably in the end.'Liverpool ended up being pulled apart'Media caption, How 'electric' Doku helped Man City 'dismantle' LiverpoolI am really surprised Liverpool's potential problem down the right was not identified before the game.Since he broke into the team a year ago, O'Reilly has been a real positive for City from an attacking perspective and frequently ends up in left wing or even centre-forward areas.So City were always going to look for an overload from him and Doku down that flank, and it was down to Liverpool to deal with it.But because Salah stayed high up the pitch when O'Reilly was flying forward, it left Bradley isolated, and with a dilemma - did he commit and stick with Doku, or drop off him and pick up O'Reilly charging forward instead?Image caption, Salah staying so high meant Bradley (red circle, right) frequently had to deal with two City players - Doku (top blue circle) and O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running at himAs I explained on Match of the Day, Bradley was caught in between both players a lot because he was unsure what to do, but whatever he did it felt like there was always so much space over there for City to exploit.It was hard for Ryan Gravenberch to do much about it, because if he went out there too early he was only leaving space centrally instead, where the likes of Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki were looking for pockets to get on the ball.Ibrahima Konate tried to help Bradley too, but he was having to cover a lot of distance to get over to support his right-back, and being dragged across meant he left space behind him in the middle as well.Image caption, For the move that led to Doku's goal in the second half, Gravenberch cannot help Bradley (red circle, left) because he is picking up Foden centrally. The ball is played out to O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running to the edge of the Liverpool area, who finds Doku in space to cut in and bend a beautiful shot into the corner of the netLiverpool ended up being pulled part and, like I say, they must have been aware it could happen before the game.The best opposition, with the best players, find your weakness. Chelsea deliberately targeted Liverpool down the right in the same way a few weeks ago, because they knew the problem with Salah existed - but Sunday turned into an even bigger expose of the issue.It is something that cannot go on. Liverpool cannot allow this to keep happening when they play the top sides, especially away from home where they see less of the ball and have less control of the game.Image caption, More than half of City's attacks came down their left, through Doku and O'Reilly. \"It's a very deliberate ploy,\" said Murphy on MOTD.Other things must have concerned Slot tooA lot of people will say that Liverpool have had success for years without Salah tracking back.While Salah did defend more under Jurgen Klopp, he spoke last season about not being given so much defensive responsibility by Slot and how much he was enjoying that. Let's remember Liverpool won the title with him playing that way.But there's a difference between never doing it and sometimes doing it. Last season, when Liverpool won at Etihad Stadium, Salah's defensive performance was among the best I've seen from him.This time, I think it was maybe down to him to look at how Bradley was having a tough time and decide 'I am going to help him out', even if it was just for 15 minutes or half an hour, to help Liverpool get back in the game.I am not saying Salah should now become a completely different player - you don't want him running back every time you lose the ball, because sometimes you want him ready for the transition where O'Reilly is out of position. Salah almost got in a few times like that on Sunday, because of his pace, but there has to be balance.In a game like this one, where you are 20 minutes in and Doku has been running your right-back ragged, then you could drop in for a spell even if you've been told you don't have to. I don't understand why he didn't do it at all.Image caption, Doku was the top player in the match for shots on target, touches in the opposition box, dribbles completed, duels won and fouls wonDecisions did not cost Liverpool the gameThat failure to try to fix things during the game was another disappointing part of Liverpool's display, but there were plenty of other things that must have concerned Slot too.Especially in the first half, they did not press particularly well. They lacked tenacity without the ball and seemed slow when they were in possession. In both areas, they were well below the level we saw in their previous two games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid.Now, of course they played a huge game on Tuesday against Real, one of the best teams in Europe, and put every bit of effort in to get a positive result.I get that, but City also played in the Champions League, a day later, so I don't believe Liverpool can use the Real game as an excuse.Media caption, Liverpool 'completely dominated' by Manchester City in first half, says SlotIf Virgil van Dijk's equaliser against City had been allowed to stand then I suppose things might have been different - Liverpool had started really poorly but moments like that can change momentum in games.I still think it was a poor decision, even when you break down the laws behind it, because Andy Robertson did not affect Gianluigi Donnarumma, but I would emphasise that decision did not cost Liverpool the game - City dominated them in all departments.Are Liverpool still in title race?Media caption, Guardiola beaming after win over Liverpool in 1,000th game as a managerThis result meant a good week for Slot ended badly, especially regarding the Premier League title race.The defeat is not quite as damaging as it could have been, because leaders Arsenal drew on Saturday and dropped points.But Liverpool are still eight points behind the Gunners and the biggest observation for me so far this season is that they are not consistently playing well enough to be able to think they can close that gap.This is a challenging time for Slot and his players but it is so early in the campaign, and there is plenty of time for them to bounce back and find some balance and rhythm, and cut out the mistakes.At the moment, though, all that feels like it is a long way off.City were not just the better team on Sunday who created the better chances, they were dominant for most of the game. Since their blip in August when they lost back-to-back games, they have looked really strong.At the moment Pep Guardiola's side are the ones who look most likely to compete with Arsenal for the title, while Liverpool need to find a way of becoming harder to beat.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "body": "58 minutes agoIan Youngs,Culture reporter and Chi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondent PA MediaTim Westwood attended Westminster Magistrates' Court on MondayEx-BBC Radio 1 and former Capital Xtra DJ Tim Westwood has appeared in court for his first hearing since being charged with four counts of rape last month.The 68-year-old has also been charged with nine counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual assault. Three of the accounts of indecent assault are alleged to have taken place in BBC studios in the 1990s.The charges related to seven women, some as young as 17 years old, with the allegations spanning from 1983 to 2016. Mr Westwood was granted bail at a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday. He has not yet been asked to enter a plea, but he has previously denied claims of misconduct.Wearing a dark grey shirt at the hearing, he spoke to confirm his full name, address and date of birth.He was released on bail, on the condition that he does not contact prosecution witnesses.His case will next be heard at Southwark Crown Court on 8 December.He has been charged with the following offences:In 1983, a 17-year-old girl was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Fulham area of London.In 1986, a woman in her 20s was allegedly indecently assaulted in the Vauxhall area of London.Between 1995 and 1996, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped in London. It is also alleged that the same woman was indecently assaulted in central London within the same timeframe.Between 2000 and 2001, a female between the age of 17-18 was allegedly raped and indecently assaulted in London.In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly raped in London.In 2010, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in Stroud.In 2016, a woman in her 20s was allegedly sexually assaulted in the Finchley area of London.Mr Westwood was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and joined Radio 1 to host his rap show from 1994. He left in 2013 and then hosted a show on Capital Xtra until 2022.",

    "body": "Typhoon moves away from Philippines after killing two9 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, Aurora, Philippines, Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines  and Koh Ewe,SingaporeWatch: BBC reports from Luzon Island in wake of Typhoon Fung-wongA weakened Typhoon Fung-wong is now passing over the South China Sea and expected to head to Taiwan, after leaving two people dead in the Philippines.Some 1.4 million in the Philippines had been preemptively evacuated before Fung-wong made landfall on Sunday as a super typhoon, carrying winds of 185km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).It hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT) and weakened to a typhoon hours later.Fung-wong comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left nearly 200 people dead. Philippine authorities are reporting less severe damage than expected - though a number of communities are still cut off by the floods.By daybreak, the winds from Typhoon Fung-wong which had howled all night had died down, and people came out to see the damage.There was plenty of damage to buildings, but good preparation appears to have prevented a repeat of the casualties seen after Kalmaegi hit the central Philippines last week.The country's meteorological service had earlier warned of destructive winds and \"high risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.Hundreds of flights were cancelled, buildings were secured and residents in low-lying and coastal areas had been urged to move to higher ground. At a shelter in central Aurora, parents brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013.\"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano had earlier told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Getty ImagesMany neighbourhoods have been flooded and some are now isolated from the rest of the countryThe winds Fung-wong brought were not as strong as in some previous storms, and its destructive power quickly weakened after it made landfall.Two deaths were reported, according to the civil defence office: one person drowned, while another woman was found dead under debris in Catbalogan City. Two others were injured. Still, many neighbourhoods have been flooded, and some are now isolated from the rest of the country after roads and bridges were cut by the high water levels.Aurora officials told local media on Monday that four towns have been blocked.Power is down in much of the main island of Luzon.ReutersThe Filipino government had declared a state of calamity across the country in preparation for Typhoon Fung-wong and in the wake of Kalmaegi.This gives government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year, left at least 204 people dead in the Philippines, while more than 100 are missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?",

    "body": "Surgical menopause like a 'hormonal cliff edge'6 hours agoCash MurphySouth EastKate DysonKate Dyson started the campaign group Surge Menopause after her experiences with surgical menopauseA woman who was plunged into sudden menopause after surgery to remove both ovaries is spearheading efforts to change NHS policy.Kate Dyson, 44, from Hastings, East Sussex, underwent the surgery six months ago after having a subtotal hysterectomy in 2021 to remove her uterus - a procedure which leaves the cervix in place.The mum-of-three says she was completely unprepared for the impact of surgical menopause, which is triggered by both ovaries being removed.\"Honestly, it was like falling off a hormonal cliff edge,\" she told BBC Radio Sussex.\"Within hours of the surgery I was home the same day. I was experiencing hot flushes, confusion, and the first night I woke up in the morning and I was absolutely dripping with sweat,\" she said. Ms Dyson found the aftercare galling, and said this was commonplace for women.\"We are discharged without hormones, without warning, and without support,\" she said.\"In my discharge notes it simply read, 'can try combined HRT [hormone replacement therapy] if she wishes', as if it were suggesting a glass of wine at the weekend.\"This experience prompted her to start campaign group Surge Menopause, whose aim is to push the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to revolutionise its offering.The DHSC said it was taking action to combat deficiencies, including adding menopause advice to NHS health checks and bringing down gynecology waiting lists.A spokesperson said: \"It is unacceptable women are not receiving the proper care and support following surgical menopause and the Health Secretary has been clear that we inherited a broken NHS with too many women still subject to a system that doesn't listen to their experiences or understand their needs.\"Menopause 'one-stop shop'Ms Dyson said: \"We're calling for every woman facing ovary removal to receive clear information about the impact of surgical menopause pre-surgery, supportive information about hormone therapy and automatic access to HRT where it's safe, and proper follow-up care that responds to the severity of symptoms experienced by women in surgical menopause.\"According to research by Newson Health and Dr Ceri Cashell, only 4.8% of 126 pre-menopausal women at three NHS hospitals who underwent surgery to remove both ovaries received HRT afterwards.This is despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) and British Menopause Society recommending HRT until the average age of natural menopause, around the age of 51.Ms Dyson built the Surge website herself in a bid to create a \"one-stop shop\" for all matters around surgical menopause.Her biggest objective was to create a space where those affected could learn what life looks like \"in this whole new chapter of surgical menopause\".Related storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "10 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Nell FrizzellBetween deadlines, school runs and the constant \"what's for dinner?\" chat, even the best relationships can start running on autopilot.It doesn't mean the spark has gone or that you've stopped loving your partner, but rather that life has got in the way.Writer Nell Frizzell knows this all too well - after 10 years with her partner and two young children, she admits she doesn't have as much time or energy for her husband as she once did.\"I know we're told to focus on quality time, physical touch and gaze into each other's eyes lovingly but actually I am shouting at my husband to turn the eggs off.\" Frizzell says she's at a \"crunch point\" in her life. Her time, body and attention are being pulled in every direction - she's raising children, caring for elderly parents, running the home and working all at the same time.\"And within all of that, where do you have the time to look into someone's eyes and say you're wonderful?\" she asks.Bring other people inBut Frizzell has discovered something that helps keep her relationship connection alive - something she calls a \"third energy\".Not in the bedroom, she laughs, but at the dinner table.\"If we go away, we go with another family and if we go out to dinner, I love having friends there,\" she explains.It's a surprisingly simple idea - but Frizzell says having dinner with another couple, friends or family really does work as the presence of other people naturally changes the dynamic.She says sometimes a so-called date night \"where you're sat across the table with the person you live with and trying to come up with something new to say\" can be intense, so another person can help provide a new conversation starter or a fresh perspective.Frizzell says: \"I find him incredibly attractive when we're with people we don't see all the time as they ask him questions I wouldn't think to ask or tell him things I wouldn't tell him.\"Nell FrizellNell and her husband say a \"third energy\" has really improved their relationship Psychotherapist Susanna Abse says a little space and variety can be vital to a successful relationship.\"Couples can end up moving around each other but avoiding real contact,\" she says.Truly noticing your partner can make a big difference.  \"Instead of coming downstairs in the morning and getting on with millions of chores, see what state your partner is in.\" Abse recommends asking them questions like how they are feeling or what their day looks like as \"curiosity is key\". Clinical psychologist Dr Amani Milligan says spending quality time together is also important.That doesn't mean a grand gesture and Dr Milligan says it can be as simple as taking a random Thursday off work together or setting rules like no phones before bed so you can catch up on each other's days.Relationships can come with endless distractions from emails and notifications on your phone to endless piles of laundry or dishes that need sorting.Abse says electronic devices can make couples more distant.\"Protest if your partner is on their phone all the time and set some rules you can both agree to.\"Schedule sexIt's near impossible to talk about keeping love alive without mentioning physical intimacy and Frizzell swears by scheduling it.\"It might feel administrative to say 'this is when we'll have sex' but with small children, it's absolutely key and it's something to look forward to.\"Abse agrees with that practical approach and says if you're not having sex \"you have to recognise the risk in that\" if you're both not happy with the arrangement as \"affairs often arise from unsatisfied needs\".When we're time poor or have a lot on, sex can be one of the first things to go but Abse says you should try to \"allow yourself to be persuadable\".\"You don't get into bed feeling very sexual but maybe with your partner's attention that might change.\"Focusing more on each other and seeing her partner anew has improved Frizzell's relationship.The final lesson she has learnt is that it's important to keep a little mystery from each other. \"Close the toilet door and have a bit of separation - by all means have a joint project but that shouldn't be going to the loo,\" she laughs.",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterA former Tesco boss has been appointed to the top job at Guinness-owner Diageo, as the biggest drinks firm in the world seeks to turnaround its flagging sales.Sir Dave Lewis will take over the brewing giant on 1 January, after former chief executive Debra Crew quit in the summer after two years in charge.The firm has been battling weaker sales across its range despite a growth in Guinness sales, with shares recently falling to a 10-year low.Following the announcement of Sir Dave's appointment on Monday, Diageo's share price rose 7% in early trading.Diageo owns well-known brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka and Captain Morgan rum, but has seen sales falling in key markets, in particular the US and China.Sir Dave was chief executive of Tesco for six years until 2020, and before that had spent nearly 30 years at consumer goods giant Unilever. He will leave his current role as chairman of health firm Haleon.Diageo said its board felt Sir Dave had extensive chief executive experience and proven leadership skills \"that is right for Diageo at this time\".\"The market faces some headwinds but there are also significant opportunities,\" said Sir Dave.\"I look forward to working with the team to face these challenges and realise some of the opportunities in a way which creates shareholder value.\"Diageo saw its operating profits decline to to £3.2bn in the year to June - around 28% lower compared with the same period the year before. It said there was \"clearly much more to do\" in what it called a challenging year, citing \"pressure on consumers\".Rising inflation has led to people tightening their spending in recent times, with consumers cutting back on drinking and eating out.The firm has also been battling with changing drinking habits from younger people, who are opting to drink less alcohol than previous generations.\"Dave Lewis needs to put Diageo back on track quickly,\" said Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell.\"His style is to listen closely to customers and suppliers and work out what's gone wrong. The focus will be on repair work, not long-term growth.\"Mr Coatsworth said the new boss earned the nicknam \"Drastic Dave\" while at Unilever \"because of his ability to make bold decisions without simply tinkering at the edges\".\"At Tesco, he walked away after saying his job to stabilise the business was done, rather than sticking around to take the business to the next level. One might suggest the same approach will apply to Diageo.\"Sir Dave will replace Nik Jhangiani - Diageo's previous chief financial officer - who has been acting as interim chief executive since Ms Crew resigned in July.Mr Jhangiani will revert back to being chief financial officer.",

    "body": "6 hours agoGraham FraserBBC ScotlandUniversity of DundeeProf Iris Grunwald demonstrates the technology which she says now shows that a specialist doesn't need to be \"in the same hospital, or even in the same country, to help you\"Doctors from Scotland and the US have completed what is thought to be a world-first stroke procedure using a robot.Prof Iris Grunwald, of the University of Dundee, performed the remote thrombectomy - the removal of blood clots after a stroke - on a human cadaver that had been donated to medical science.The professor was at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, while the body she was operating on while using the machine was across the city at the university.Hours later, Ricardo Hanel - a neurosurgeon in Florida - used the technology to carry out the first transatlantic surgery from his Jacksonville base on a human body in Dundee over 4,000 miles (6,400km) away.University of DundeeThe team watch on as Ricardo Hanel performs the procedure from FloridaThe team has called it a potential \"game changer\" if it becomes approved for use on patients. The medics believe this technology could transform stroke care, as a delay in accessing specialist treatment can have a direct impact on the chances of recovery.Prof Grunwald said: \"It felt as if we were witnessing the first glimpse of the future.\"Where previously this was thought to be science fiction, we demonstrated that every step of the procedure can already be done.\"The University of Dundee is the global training centre of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, and is the only place in the UK where doctors can operate on cadavers with liquid which mimics human blood circulated in the vessels.\"This was the first time that we could perform the whole mechanical thrombectomy procedure in a real human body to show that all steps of the procedure are possible,\" said Prof Grunwald.Juliet Bouverie, the chief executive of the Stroke Association charity, told BBC News the transatlantic procedure was \"a remarkable innovation\".She added: \"For too long, people living in remote and rural areas have been deprived of access to thrombectomy. \"Robotics like this could rebalance the inequity which exists in stroke treatment across the UK.\"University of DundeeProf Grunwald says the new technology \"could make expert stroke treatment available to everyone\"In the experiment, fluid which mimics human blood was used in four different cadavers. The subjects, who donated their bodies to science, died within the past three years and were then embalmed.Both the Dundee and Florida procedures were carried out last month using robotics from the Lithuanian firm Sentante.While there have been remote thrombectomies carried out before on a silicon model, a 3D printed replica and on an animal, this is thought to have been the first procedure on a human body.The team now hope to take part in clinical trials next year.How does the technology work?An ischaemic stroke occurs when an artery is blocked by a clot. This cuts off blood and oxygen supply to the brain, and brain cells lose function and die.The best treatment is a thrombectomy, where a specialist uses catheters and wires to remove the clot. But what happens when a patient can't get to a specialist who can do the procedure?Prof Grunwald said the experiment demonstrated a robot could be connected to the same catheters and wires a surgeon would normally use, and a medic who is with the patient could simply attach the wires.The surgeon, in another location, could then hold and move their own wires, and the robot then carries out exactly the same movements in real time on the patient to carry out the thrombectomy.The patient would be in a hospital operating room, while the doctor could carry out the procedure using the Sentante machine from anywhere - even their own home.Prof Grunwald and Ricardo Hanel could see live X-rays of the body in the experiments, and monitor progress in real time, with the Dundee expert saying it took only took 20 minutes of training.Tech giants Nvidia and Ericsson were involved in the project to ensure the connectivity of the robot.Dr Hanel said: \"To operate from the US to Scotland with a 120 millisecond lag - a blink of an eye - is truly remarkable.\"SentanteIn this earlier demonstration of the technology, it shows how a doctor - who could be anywhere - can move the wires, and the technology records the movementsSentanteIn this same demo, the robot  - which could be attached to a patient - replicates the movement of the remote surgeonThe future of stroke treatmentProf Grunwald, who has won an award from Innovate UK for her work and is also the vice president of the World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment, said there were two main problems with a standard thrombectomy - a global shortage of doctors who can do it, and treatment depends on your location.In Scotland, there are only three places patients can receive the procedure - Dundee, Glasgow and Edinburgh. If you don't live there, you must travel.Prof Grunwald said: \"The treatment is very time sensitive.\"Every six minutes delay, you have a 1% less chance of having a good outcome.\"This technology would now provide a new way where you're not depending on where you live - saving the valuable minutes where your brain is otherwise dying.\"Public Health Scotland said there were 9,625 ischaemic strokes in Scotland last year. Only 212 - or 2.2% of all patients - received a thrombectomy, while 1,045 people received medication to burst the clots. For the rest of the UK, only 3.9% of all stroke patients received a thrombectomy in the year to March 2024.\"It feels amazing,\" added Edvardas Satkauskas, the CEO of Sentante, speaking to BBC News from the company's base in Lithuania.\"Sometimes, the future is way closer than we think.\"",

The 21-year-old, of Rosedale Avenue, Smethwick, is also charged with two counts of causing actual bodily harm on 27 October and 7 November, possession of a Stanley blade and assaulting a detention escort officer.Rafael, who appeared before District Judge John Bristow, was told to be quiet as he interrupted the six-minute hearing multiple times.He was told he was not going to be asked to enter any pleas because the offences are too serious to be dealt with by the magistrates' court.The case was sent to Birmingham Crown Court for a hearing on 12 November.It happened just outside the Bullring shopping centre on FridayThe force said officers would be around the city centre on Monday to offer reassurance, and investigators were supporting the victim's family.Detectives are appealing for witnesses who may have seen Mr Rafael, who is described as a Black British national, and is believed to have been wearing an all-grey tracksuit, black hat, trainers and rucksack.The stabbing happened outside the Bullring shopping centre, opposite the main entrance to Birmingham New Street station.Police said they were treating it as an \"unprovoked attack\" and Det Insp James Nix said they were working to understand why it happened.Police said they believed the attack was \"unprovoked\"Shalini Doal, who works nearby, told the BBC she saw the emergency response when she finished her shift at about 22:00 on Friday.She described the scene has \"quite chaotic\" and said she and her colleagues were worried for their safety. Ashley Birks, 25, from Stoke-on-Trent, said he came to Birmingham fairly regularly to see his girlfriend who lives in the city, and was concerned about what had happened.\"It makes me worried for my girlfriend,\" he said.\"She doesn't drive and works at all of the big music venues... and to think something completely unprovoked [happened], you know, it's horrible.\"",

    "body": "20 minutes agoAna FaguyWashingtonEPAUS Senate Majority Leader John Thune helped negtotiate the weekend deal A deal aimed at ending the US government shutdown has passed the Senate, paving the way for the record-breaking impasse to be broken.After a weekend of negotiations in Washington, a minority of Democrats joined with Republicans and voted in favour of an agreement. The vote is a procedural first step towards passing a compromise to fund the government since it ran out of money 1 October.It will need to clear several more hurdles - including a vote from the House of Representatives - before federal employees and services return, but it is the first serious sign of progress after 40 days of deadlock. The Senate is expected to return for further debate at 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Monday.The current shutdown is the longest on record in the US, and until this weekend it appeared that Republican and Democratic lawmakers were locked in a stalemate. Many government services have been suspended since October, and around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay. The shutdown has had wide ranging impacts on a variety of services, including US air travel and food benefits for 41 million low-income Americans. The agreement was negotiated between Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House, with Democratic senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.Republicans - who hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate - needed the measure to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold.They were able attract eight votes from the other side of the aisle, while losing just one in Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who voted against after saying the bill would increase national debt.The deal includes an agreement for a vote in December on extending healthcare subsidies that are due to expire this year, a key issue Democrats had been holding out for concessions on. Watch: Moment deal aimed at ending US shutdown passesDemocratic Party leaders had said that they would not lend their support to new funding for government operations until Congress addressed the subsidies that help tens of millions of Americans pay for health insurance purchased through government-run exchanges.\"I'm thankful to be able to say we have senators, both Democrats and Republicans, who are eager to get to work to address that crisis in a bipartisan way,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune said ahead of the vote.\"We also have a president who is willing to sit down and get to work on this issue. So I'm looking forward to seeing what solutions might be brought forward.\"Thune did not say exactly what that bill would contain, which frustrated many Democrats in the House and the Senate, who argued that the Democrats who negotiated the deal did so without getting enough in return. \"For months and months Democrats have been fighting to get the Senate to address the healthcare crisis,\" said Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate. \"This bill does nothing to ensure that that crisis is addressed,\" he said as he confirmed he would vote against the deal.Some high-profile Democrats have been highly critical of colleagues who sided with Republicans to end the shutdown without concrete guarantees on healthcare, with California Governor Gavin Newsom calling the decision \"pathetic\". The measure also includes three appropriations bills to fund agencies like veterans affairs and agriculture, as well as a continuing resolution to finance the rest of the government until 30 January - meaning another government shutdown could be on the horizon early next year.It also includes guarantees that all federal workers will be paid for time during the shutdown, and funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) - an essential food safety net for one in eight Americans - until next September.A vote on the deal would only be the first procedural step in the new funding agreement and it would still need to be approved by the US House of Representatives, where it is likely to see its own challenges.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "13 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorA look back at how Tim Davie dealt with BBC scandals over the yearsThis is seismic. To lose both the director general and the CEO of BBC News at the same time is unprecedented. It's an extraordinary moment in the history of the BBC.It can't be overstated.On the face of it, Tim Davie's resignation makes some sense.I have wondered for some time whether he was weighing up how much longer he wanted to stay in a job that is highly pressurised. There have been occasions when I have interviewed him this year, as the controversies mounted, and he didn't seem his usual Tigger-ish self.In his resignation statement he referenced \"the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times\". My assessment is that the latest controversy felt one too many after a succession of crises (two Gaza documentaries, the Bob Vylan Glastonbury issue amongst them) and he didn't have enough oil in the tank for another fight.As former head of BBC comms, John Shield put it to me \"the DG job is one of the hardest in public life\". \"It has been relentless for him. He is a very capable leader who has driven real change, but at some point it becomes unsustainably attritional.\"I'm told there was still real shock when Tim Davie shared his decision with colleagues over the weekend.Deborah Turness' statement makes clear she has resigned on a point of principle. With the ongoing controversy around the President Trump Panorama causing damage to the BBC, she said \"the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director general last night\".But, as with any resignation, and certainly with two, I can't help thinking there is more to this than meets the eye. And there is another story emerging about the functionality and make up of the BBC Board and its role in what has happened.It appears there has been a rift between the Board and the news division with some arguing the BBC has, for too long, failed to address institutional bias inside the BBC and others questioning whether what's unfolded has been an orchestrated - and politicised - campaign against the corporation which has claimed two big scalps.For the best part of a week, since the Telegraph first broke its story - reporting a leaked internal BBC memo - I haven't been able to understand why the BBC did not get on the front foot in the face of a deluge of damaging headlines about claims of systemic bias.It needed to divide the allegations into two distinct stories. The first, about the edit of the Trump speech in the Panorama programme, needed addressing immediately. Either with a swift apology - or indeed a case made for why the BBC believed it had not mischaracterised the president's words.That would have allowed the BBC to come out fighting more widely on behalf of its journalism. Remember, it was being accused of institutional bias. Of a lack of impartiality. Accusations that cut to the heart of its news operation.With an apology for the mistake around the Panorama (or a robust defence), it could have gone on to try to refute the other claims about institutional bias. It could have said that the BBC had already been taking action to ensure editorial impartiality, and had already acted, for example, on issues at BBC Arabic which was accused in the leaked memo of anti-Israel bias in its coverage of the war in Gaza.Instead the BBC allowed the story to fester - and we ended up in a situation where the Trump White House was calling the BBC \"fake news\" and it had some traction.My understanding from multiple sources inside the BBC is that a statement on Panorama had been ready to go for days. The BBC planned to say on the Trump edit that it hadn't intended to mislead the public, but that in light of looking at it again, it believed there should have been some kind of white flash or wipe, to make clear to audiences that these were two distinct parts of the speech.I understand Deborah Turness became more and more angry and frustrated as the week went on because she was prevented by the Board from putting out that apology.Instead the BBC Board decided a letter to the Culture Media and Sport Committee was the way to go. (Others have told me it's not as clearcut as this characterisation. That it took some time for news bosses to accept the Panorama edit had been an error and that there were discussions on all sides on how to respond.)Tim Davie pictured in 2016, before he took over as director generalMany, both inside and outside the BBC, see the failure to respond as a grave mistake. The Telegraph's drip feed of allegations was damaging - and the BBC wasn't tackling them head on.I have been told that Turness then went into a board meeting on Thursday to discuss the crisis around the Telegraph stories and was \"ripped apart\", as some have described it.Those who have called the BBC's journalism into question would call that accountability.But another source characterised it as the culmination of a \"relentless critique of BBC journalism over two years by members of the Board and advisers - all of whom come from same political persuasion\".They point to Sir Robbie Gibb, a former BBC editor who left to become Downing St director of communications for Theresa May and who is now a member of the Board.The former Sun editor, now BBC presenter David Yelland has called it \"nothing short of a coup\". He claims the BBC Board has been undermined and \"elements close to it have worked with hostile newspaper editors, a former PM and enemies of public service broadcasting\".But another former Sun editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, had a very different take. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, he said the resignations were \"the right thing to do - this was an issue that was never going away\".The editing of the speech, he said, could have led to Trump suing or the BBC being banned from the White House. \"If you can't be trusted on that [the speech of the US president] what can you be trusted on?\" he said.And the US president himself has weighed into the debate for the first time. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he celebrated the resignations and accused the BBC of \"doctoring\" his speech and \"trying to step on the scales of a presidential election\".I'm struck by a line in Tim Davie's statement. He said this about the BBC: \"We should champion it, not weaponise it.\"Tonight, some are asking whether the resignations of both the director general and the CEO of News suggests the BBC has been weaponised.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

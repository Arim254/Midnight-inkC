    "body": "8 hours agoKayla EpsteinNew York CityGetty ImagesLuigi Mangione in court in December 2025A man accused of impersonating a federal agent in a bid to allegedly free Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down the CEO of United Healthcare in 2024, has been arrested. Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been \"signed by a judge\" to free the accused killer.Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork \"signed by a judge\" to authorise the release of an inmate.When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's license, claimed be in possession of weapons, and \"displayed and threw\" what authorities described as \"numerous documents\" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large \"barbeque type fork\" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter.The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source.Department of JusticeAuthorities searched Anderson's bag after he claimed to have weapons and found these utensils, according to the criminal complaintAnderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs.Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentFamily handoutRoyal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck was found dead in her barracks at Larkhill in Wiltshire after taking her own life in 2021Two serving British Army officers are to face a court martial over the handling of a case of sexual assault of the teenage soldier Jaysley Beck, who later took her own life.Gunner Jaysley Beck, 19, was found dead at her barracks at Larkhill camp in Wiltshire in 2021. She had complained she had been sexually assaulted. Last October, former Battery Sergeant Michael Webber was jailed for six months for sexual assault.An earlier inquest into her death heard the Army's handling of her complaint had played \"more than a minimal contributory part into her death\".The Army has already issued an apology, saying it was \"profoundly sorry\" for the failings identified at the inquest.The Service Prosecution Authority has now charged two officers in Beck's chain of command.The BBC has been told they are Major James Hook and Colonel Samantha Shepherd, who were both made aware of her complaint before she took her life. After the inquest, Beck's family had written to the head of the Army, General Sir Roly Walker, requesting that further action be taken against both officers.In a statement, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said: \"Following an investigation by the Defence Serious Crime Command, we can confirm two individuals have been charged with offences under Section 19 of the Armed Forces Act (conduct prejudicial to good order and service discipline).\"It would be inappropriate to comment further as legal proceedings are ongoing.\"Beck's mother, Leighann McCready, said that \"more than 4 years on from the loss of our daughter we are very relieved to have finally got to this point.\"The MoD has set up a serious crime command and launched a violence against women and girls taskforce, and more recently has agreed in principle to remove the handling of serious complaints from the individual services.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is pictured alongside China's Xi Jinping on most of Friday's papers, following their meeting in Beijing on Thursday. The Financial Times says Sir Keir is seeking to \"restore better relations\" with the Chinese president, at what the paper is calling \"a time of global instability\". The prime minister is also front and centre of the Telegraph, which features a photograph of Sir Keir attending a ceremonial welcome in the Chinese capital, paired with the caption \"Starmer among friends\". The paper has also launched a \"Campaign for democracy\", and leads with a \"revolt\" over cancelled local elections around the UK. Councillors in Norfolk and Welwyn Hatfield have stood down \"in protest\" of the \"axed\" votes, and the Telegraph says others are considering taking similar action.\"Capitulation in Beijing\" declares the Mail, condemning what it says is a trip for the prime minister to \"suck up to\" China. Sir Keir \"gave the go-ahead to China's nest of spies embassy\", the paper says, and will leave China \"virtually empty-handed\". Planning permission for China's controversial new embassy in London was granted earlier this month, after repeated delays. The Chinese embassy previously said: \"Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government's consideration over this planning application. This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.\"The Guardian says Sir Keir has taken a \"major step towards rapprochement\" with China, opening the door for Xi to visit the UK. The Star takes a lighter approach to the visit, writing \"Great ball of China\" after the prime minister gifted Xi the football used during last weekend's English Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal. The Chinese president is reported to be a supporter of Manchester United, while Sir Keir is an Arsenal fan.\"Iranian guard corps to be treated as terrorists by UK\" reads the Times, after the European Union added the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its list of terrorist organisations on Thursday. The group operates separately to Iran's army, and has sworn loyalty to the Ayatollah. According to the paper, the Home Office has been drawing up legislation to enable the ban since last May, but sources have told the Times that is now likely to be brought forward.The i Paper reports that the Home Office is set to deport asylum seekers to Syria, despite concerns about \"violence and deteriorating conditions\" in the \"war-torn\" nation. The shift is part of Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood's promised migrant reforms, it says, which have been inspired by similar policies in Denmark.Thieves have targeted a Cheshire property shared by presenter Maya Jama and footballer Ruben Dias, according to the Sun. It reports that the couple are \"devastated\", after clothing, jewellery and clothes were taken from the \"£4m Omaze prize-draw mansion\". The Mirror leads on fresh comments from boxer Anthony Joshua, who has paid tribute to the two friends killed in a car crash that he \"miraculously survived\" at the end of last year. The paper said he referred to the men as his \"brothers\", and said he still couldn't \"get my head around it\".The assisted dying bill leads the Express, which features an interview with a terminally ill mother issuing a \"desperate plea\" to the seven peers blocking the legislation from passing through the House of Lords. The Metro says a London bus driver has been sacked for \"gross misconduct\", after he allegedly chased down and punched a thief who had \"snatched\" a passenger's necklace. Sir Keir Starmer's visit to China features prominently in Friday's papers. The Financial Times says the prime minister has been working to heal the ties between the countries. The Times says Sir Keir has vowed to build a more sophisticated relationship with China. The Daily Mirror says \"closer ties with Beijing could reap trade benefits for Britain at a time when the government needs to get the economy firing\". The Guardian says the \"reset\" in the relationship has opened the door to a visit to the UK by President Xi. The Daily Mail has a more critical analysis of the visit, saying \"Sir Kowtow Starmer... announced deals so underwhelming, critics responded 'Is that it?'\"The Times believes the UK is to follow the EU in proscribing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. The paper says ministers will act as pressure grows to respond to the group's bloody suppression of anti-government protests.The i Paper leads with the suggestion that the UK is to deport asylum seekers to Syria in a crackdown on migrants. The paper says the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is seeking to tackle the small boats crisis and the rise of Reform UK.The Telegraph says the government's plan to cancel local elections for four-and-a-half million people is descending into farce - as a string of councillors have resigned over the delays. The paper says that several councillors across the country are considering whether to stand down to force by-elections. Labour is allowing some councils to delay the ballots because of plans to reorganise local government.The Telegraph says the much anticipated exhibition of the historical Bayeux tapestry at the British Museum later this year could be scuppered - by potholes. It says French heritage campaigners have warned that vibrations caused by potholes both in the UK and France could rip apart the nearly 1,000-year-old embroidered cloth. \"That's one in the eye for history fans,\" suggests the Daily Express.The Sun notes that while most adults spend around £2,000 on an engagement ring, in the run-up to Valentines Day, Asda is selling one for 96 pence - less, it points out, than the cost of a cucumber. \"Will you marry mean?\" is its headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoKali HaysTechnology reporterEPASales of the iPhone hit an all-time high in the final three months of last year, boosted by the new range of iPhone 17s, tech firm Apple reported on Thursday.Revenue rose by 16% compared to the same period last year to $144bn (£82.5bn) - the strongest growth since 2021 - thanks to a jump in sales in China, as well as Europe, the Americas, and Japan.However, sales in other parts of the company were less positive.Wearables and accessories, which include things like the Apple Watch and AirPods, fell by roughly 3%. Sales of Mac computers were down by just over 7%.Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the iPhone's boost in sales meant the firm was in \"supply chase mode.\"\"To meet a very high level of customer demand, we're currently constrained,\" Cook said on a call with financial analysts. Demand for the iPhone 17 \"exceeded our expectations, to say the least,\" he said, noting that sales in India set a quarterly record for the region.Cook declined to give any detail on a recently announced partnership with Google, in which the latter company's Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) product will be the basis of future Apple AI models and updates to its Siri functionality. \"Where investors are really wondering about what Apple is going to do next is on AI because they have hung back more than some of the other big tech names,\" said Anna MacDonald, investment manager at investment firm Aubrey.She told the BBC that Apple products, including the packaging, should represent a \"pleasurable, perfect experience\", and that the current \"stumbling\" responses of ChatGPt are very \"un-Apple-like\", which could explain the firm's caution in rolling out AI.But the company's ability stay on top of the smartphone market is \"perhaps more uncertain than ever\", according to Jacob Bourne, an analyst with Emarketer.\"It has to make the most of its Google Gemini partnership to deliver Siri upgrades that make consumer voice AI relevant, seamless, and monetisible,\" Bourne said.Apple and Google have a separate partnership for search, in which Google effectively provides the search engine capabilities for Apple Safari.Hardware over AIApple plans to spend $16bn in the coming fiscal year on further build-out of its business, including retail stores and infrastructure.Compared to a company like Microsoft, which spent more than $37bn in capital expenditures in its most recent quarter alone, largely on AI projects, Apple's spending is conservative.Wall Street investors have expressed concerns with how much Microsoft is spending on AI with without a similar growth in revenue.After reporting its quarterly results on Wednesday, the company's stock fell by 10% during Thursday trading, it's biggest single-day drop since 2020.",

    "body": "40 minutes agoBen HattonBBC NewsPA MediaThe site of a drone attack in Kyiv earlier in January US President Donald Trump says Russia's Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital Kyiv and other parts of the country for a week due to \"extraordinary cold\" weather. Russia has not confirmed an agreement, but Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the move.While Trump did not specify when the pause would begin, overnight into Friday air raid alerts went off in just four Ukrainian regions that are close to the frontline.Temperatures in Kyiv were due to plummet from Thursday and reach -24C (-11F) over the next few days. In recent weeks, Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. Ukraine's Air Force said on Friday that the four areas where sirens went off had been targeted by 80 Russian drones and a ballistic missile.Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC on Thursday, the US president said: \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.\"\"It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it,\" Trump added.The Ukrainians, he said, \"almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly\". Later on Thursday, in a post on social media, Zelensky said Trump had made an \"important statement\" about \"the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period\". \"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We expect the agreements to be implemented,\" he said. The BBC understands that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response.Last week, Russian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the UAE for the first trilateral talks since the war began.All sides described the talks as constructive, but there has been no announcement that Russia had agreed to pause its attacks for the duration of the extreme cold currently gripping the region.Instead, attacks have continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.Electrical companies carry out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.Additional reporting by Abdujalil Abdurasulov",

And number two, stop killing protesters,\" the US President said, adding that \"they are killing them by the thousands\".\"We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.\"His latest remarks follow weeks of pressure on Iran to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression.Trump made his latest comments at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.Earlier this week, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\" He warned that a \"massive Armada is heading to Iran\", and it was \"ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary\". In response, Araghchi said: \"Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL - on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation - which ensures Iran's rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\"\"Such weapons have no place in our security calculations and we have NEVER sought to acquire them,\" he added.Earlier this month, Trump said that the US would come to the \"rescue\" of Iranian protesters if authorities used violence against them. Demonstrations began in late December after a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, but swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,479 people since the unrest began, including 6,092 protesters, 118 children and 214 people affiliated with the government.It is also investigating approximately 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "2 hours agoMalcolm PriorRural affairs producerPA MediaThere are thought to be approximately 21,000 tonnes of waste illegally dumped at the Oxfordshire siteTwo men have been arrested as part of an investigation into the dumping of thousands of tonnes of rubbish in a field in Oxfordshire.The Environment Agency (EA) said a 69-year-old man was arrested at a property in Andover, Hampshire, while a 54-year-old man has been arrested in Slough in connection with the massive pile of rubbish tipped near Kidlington.An EA spokeswoman told the BBC the arrests were for environmental and money laundering offences and were a \"vital step\" in ongoing investigations. Environment AgencyThe men were arrested in connection with money-laundering and environmental offencesBoth men have been released on bail.The dump in Kidlington, between the River Cherwell and the A34, is thought to contain approximately 21,000 tonnes of waste in a pile which is up to 150m (490ft) long and 6m (20ft) high.The mound of rubbish is made up of what appears to be processed domestic waste, shredded plastics, polystyrene, tyres and other household items.It is just one of 517 illegal dumps across England, at least 11 of which contain more than 20,000 tonnes of waste. They include a 280,000-tonne site in Cheshire, two 50,000-tonne sites in Lancashire and Cornwall and a 36,000-tonne tip in Kent.The total number of such larger sites is likely to be higher, as the Environment Agency has previously told the BBC it does not hold data on tonnage for every illegal tip.Most sites are in countryside locations, often hidden, and on what should be agricultural land.Police say many are run by organised crime gangs, who are making cash by charging much less than legitimate operators to take and bury waste.Businesses have to pay site fees to use legitimate licensed landfill sites, depending on the amount and type of waste they are trying to get rid of, and landfill tax is also charged at just over £126 per tonne.Community angerPreparation work to clear the Kidlington site started earlier this month amid concerns over the risk of fire and the impact that would have on the nearby A-road.A private waste clearance firm has been given the contract to deal with the site over the next 12 months at a cost of £9.6m.Emma Viner, enforcement and investigations manager for the EA's national environmental crime unit, told the BBC that the agency would be looking to recover the clearance costs under the Proceeds of Crime Act from anyone successfully prosecuted at the end of its ongoing investigation.She added that this week's arrests would help \"drive the investigation forward\" and allow the EA to \"follow more lines of inquiry to understand exactly what happened and who was involved\".\"The illegal dump at Kidlington was an atrocious and deliberate attack on our environment and the Environment Agency shares the community's anger at this horrific crime,\" she said.Environment secretary Emma Reynolds welcomed the arrests, adding: \"The illegal dumping of waste at Kidlington is appalling and has caused significant damage to the environment and distress to the local community.\"The government is committed to stamping out this type of criminality across the country, by boosting funds to tackle waste crime, hiring more officers and introducing tougher checks and penalties for those who break the law.\"The arrests were made on Thursday by officers from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) and follow an earlier arrest of a 39-year-old man from the Guildford area in November. He was released pending further enquiries.",

    "body": "7 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesOn paper, the job at a small PR agency looked ideal: a tight team, high-profile clients and the chance to build a fast-moving career.But what Maya (not her real name) had not anticipated was a \"toxic boss\" who set \"impossibly high standards\" and publicly berated staff who didn't meet them. \"She would regularly call people out in front of the whole team flinging insults like 'are you thick?' and 'this work is rubbish',\" she tells the BBC.Maya says her manager's behaviour often strayed way beyond performance management and into personal attacks.When a colleague said she had hired a personal trainer ahead of her wedding her boss left a photograph of a \"fat bride\" on her desk. A few months into the job, Maya realised that \"every single one of my colleagues would cry almost daily\". There was persistent sickness among the team \"due to poor mental health\", she says. Maya eventually left. Toxic or a personality clash?But, not every bad manager is toxic and understanding the difference matters, says Ann Francke, chief executive of the Chartered Management Institute.Many leaders fall into what the institute calls the \"accidental manager\" category where people are promoted for technical skill rather than leadership ability. In those cases, poor behaviour is usually driven by inexperience or uncertainty, not intent.A toxic boss, she says, is different as \"they deliberately lack both empathy and often self-awareness\". \"They can actively undermine their team, take credit for others' work, or rule by fear and have unrealistic expectations,\" Francke explains. The impact goes beyond personality clashes, creating anxiety that can damage both mental health and performance.\"If you have a knot in your stomach on Monday morning, constantly cowering in corridors to avoid confrontation or if you are scared to speak up in meetings for fear of retribution, that is toxicity, not a personality clash,\" she says.Getty ImagesRachel McAdams stars in Send Help where she is stranded with her toxic bossJosie (not her real name) says she spent years working for a manager who kept her under constant surveillance.\"She would relentlessly call, text and voice-note me all day long, starting from 7am until 10pm at night,\" Josie tells the BBC. \"Even on days she wasn't working she wanted to know where you were at all times.\"She also took projects away from Josie and gave them to other people and excluded members of the team from group lunches.Hannah (not her real name) told the BBC she was regularly humiliated by her boss while working for a major supermarket chain.Once she arrived at a corporate event wearing the same jumper as one of the guests.\"My boss made me take my jumper off and work the event in my vest in November,\" she tells the BBC. \"I felt like such an idiot and it was humiliating.\"The tension between a toxic boss and one of their team members is explored in Send Help, a darkly comic survival thriller in which a manager and employee are forced to confront unresolved workplace tensions after becoming stranded together on a desert island following a plane crash.Speaking at the premiere, Rachel McAdams, who plays the hard done by employee, says she's experienced difficult workplaces and remembers a particularly bad boss at a summer job.“I just quit and my advice would be to quietly quit if you can and if not try and practise some zen.”Getty ImagesRicky Gervais played David Brent - the self-absorbed manager of Slough paper merchants Wernham HoggHow to deal with a toxic bossBut often quitting isn't an option until you can find another role. Francke says there are ways to manage the situation while you decide what comes next. She recommends: Tell someone: Find a mentor outside your reporting line who understands the organisation and can offer honest, independent advice.Challenge the behaviour: Don't ambush your boss but book a meeting and raise concerns calmly and formally with specific examples. If your colleagues are also affected, consider addressing it together to show the wider impact. Your boss might not realise the damage they are causing with their behaviour.Protect yourself: Set boundaries, prioritise wellbeing and create space outside work. It can be tough, but learning how to detach yourself from a situation will help you regain perspective and plan next steps.Use HR carefully: If your organisation has good HR you can certainly confide in them but it's worth checking whether they have a record of tackling bad behaviour rather than ignoring it.Know when to escalate: If behaviour is abusive or poses reputational risk, a formal whistleblowing process may be necessary but this can be harder to do for fear of retribution.

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family9 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

The US president had been reacting to agreements aimed at increasing trade between the UK and China, announced after Sir Keir met Chinese President Xi Jinping.Speaking on Thursday, Trump went on to refer to Xi as a \"friend\" of his and said he knew the Chinese president \"very well\".Sir Chris said it would be \"bonkers frankly for the UK to ignore the presence of China on the world stage\".\"Of course, we enter into our relationship with China with our eyes wide open,\" he added.The business minister also pointed out that Trump is due to visit China himself in April. In response to Trump's remarks, Downing Street indicated that Washington had been aware of this trip and its objectives in advance.Arriving at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania on Thursday, the US president was asked by a reporter: \"What do you think about the UK going into business with China?\"Beyond his brief comments, Trump did not say anything further about the UK's engagement with China, pivoting instead to Canada and delivering a similar warning.He said it was \"even more dangerous, I think, for Canada\".  \"Canada is not doing well. They're doing very poorly, and you can't look at China as the answer,\" he added.Earlier this week, the US president threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it went through with economic deals struck with China on a recent visit to Beijing by its Prime Minister, Mark Carney.The comments come after Sir Keir said the UK's relationship with China was in a \"good, strong place\" following his talks with Xi at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday.Sir Keir said on Friday that the \"very good meetings\" with Xi had provided \"just the level of engagement that we hoped for\".\"We warmly engaged and made some real progress, actually, because the UK has got a huge amount to offer,\" he told a meeting of the UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China in Beijing.Agreements on further co-operation in other areas such as organised crime and illegal immigration were also announced.ReutersSir Keir Starmer delivers remarks at a UK-China Business Forum at the Bank of China, in Beijing on FridayThe US was the UK's largest single country trading partner in 2025, while China was the fourth largest, according to the Department for Business and Trade.The chair of the British Chamber of Commerce in China, Chris Torrens, praised Sir Keir's visit to Beijing as \"successful\". Torrens told the BBC it made \"sense for the UK to be looking to China, it's one of its larger trading partners\".He added that other Western leaders had either been to Beijing recently or would do so soon, including Trump, who is expected to visit in April.\"The US are maybe sanctioning and reprimanding other economies and slapping tariffs on countries that are doing deals with China but the US itself may well do a deal with China. In fact we expect that this year,\" Torrens told the BBC. Sir Keir arrived in Shanghai on Friday morning, his last stop in China before leaving for Tokyo to meet his Japanese counterpart, Sanae Takaichi, for a working dinner.Opposition MPs have criticised the prime minister over his trip to China – the first by a UK leader since 2018 - over the risk posed to the UK's national security and Xi's human rights record.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Sir Keir had \"gone to Beijing to kowtow to President Xi\" and accused the government of trading \"national security for economic crumbs off the Chinese table\".Security Minister Dan Jarvis said intelligence agencies had been \"integral\" to that decision-making process, and he was \"content any risks are being appropriately managed\".",

    "body": "16 hours agoLucy ManningSpecial correspondentWatch: Sasha Troufanov told the BBC the return of Ran Gvlili's body was a 'big relief'A former Israeli hostage who was held for nearly 500 days in Gaza says the return of the body of the final hostage this week means all the released captives can \"now breathe and start our lives again\".Thirty-year-old Sasha Troufanov, an Amazon electronics engineer, was taken hostage on 7 October 2023 by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen. His fiancée Sapir Cohen, mother and grandmother were also kidnapped and taken to Gaza. The women were released after more than 50 days as hostages. He was freed a year ago, after 498 days in captivity.In his first international interview, Troufanov, on a visit to London, told BBC News that with the return on Monday of Ran Gvili's body meaning all the hostages were back \"it felt wonderful. We waited so long for this to happen. \"I was carrying this burden ever since I came back. It was like a weight on my shoulders that kept me from coming back to my life. Although we were released, we didn't really come out of Gaza because our friends and brothers were still there.\"But the moment was bittersweet for him as Monday was also the birthday of his father Vitaly. Troufanov only discovered his father had been murdered on 7 October on the day he was released in February 2025 and realised his dad wasn't there to meet him.Troufanov and Cohen had been visiting his family on Kibbutz Nir Oz near the border with Gaza when Palestinian gunmen stormed their homes. Cohen rolled herself up in blanket and hid under the bed but they were both captured. Troufanov was punched and also stabbed in the shoulder. \"I saw the terrorist with so much anger and hate in his face, holding his knife trying to stab me even more.\"As the attackers tried to take Troufanov off the kibbutz he managed to momentarily escape but when he gave up running they still shot him twice in each leg. \"I just felt the rush of pain going through my brain and I fell to the ground then one of the terrorists hit me with the rifle from the back of my head and split it open.\"When he arrived to Gaza, he says he was then beaten by civilians and thought \"this is the moment you're going to die\".While in Gaza, Troufanov received almost no medical treatment. He was taken once to a family home and once to a hospital where his broken leg was wrapped first with a wooden broom and then with part of a metal grill.Unlike many other hostages, he was held almost entirely in isolation. For only two  of the 498 days in captivity did Troufanov see another hostage.ReutersTroufanov was released in February 2025 after 498 days in captivityAt the start he was held above ground, for more than six weeks locked in a cage and given barely enough food to survive. Here, he says he experienced sexual harassment where one guard repeatedly tried to encourage him to do a sexual act on himself. He also says a hidden camera filmed him when he was allowed a shower once a week. \"I noticed it and I took the shower trying to avoid my private parts towards this angle, but I had to do it because I needed to shower.\"Taken underground to the tunnels, Troufanov says he was left for months alone, his captors only bringing food then leaving him in a silent, cramped, humid space so dark he couldn't see his hand in front of his face.\"I remember feeling that I am buried underneath the ground while I am still alive. I was losing it. I was having a hard time to find hope in this place. Many times I lost hope completely. I said to myself: 'This is the last place you will see alive.'\"It is the first time since 2014 that there are no Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Two hundred and fifty-one people were taken captive during the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025, at least 492 Palestinians have been killed, the health ministry says, as well as four Israeli soldiers.Now all the hostages, those alive and those who were killed, have returned to Israel the second phase of US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza can commence. The key Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza is set to open on an ongoing basis for the first time since May 2024, as required under the plan.It also envisages the full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups; a technocratic Palestinian government; and the reconstruction of Gaza.Sasha Troufanov believes that these measures aren't enough to ensure an attack like the one on 7 October won't happen again. \"Rebuilding Gaza, after what happened in the war, is understandable. But first of all we need to make sure that the people of Gaza will stop trying to hurt Israel. The terrorists were telling me: 'We will do this again and again.'\"Rebuilding Gaza and opening the Rafah crossing is in vain as it will never solve the real problem. We need to find a way to make this hatred and encouragement of terrorist activity stop.\"The former hostage now has to rehabilitate mentally and physically. He is currently on crutches after surgery on his leg but hopes to dance at his wedding to Sapir Cohen in a few weeks. \"It's a victory: overcoming hate and fear and saying to ourselves: 'We will build life together and we will continue.'\"",

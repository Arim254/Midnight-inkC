    "body": "11 hours agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentBBCWhen Jane Kingsbury, 80, last had her eyes tested, she says her optician told her that her eyesight was OK. But Jane, from Cambridge, says she is giving up driving at night because the feeling of being \"dazzled\" by other vehicles has left her feeling unsafe. \"I am worried about the glare from oncoming lights,\" she says.And when Jane mentioned this at a discussion group she attends, others felt the same. \"Over 90% of us did not want to drive in the dark,\" says Jane. \"So we have changed the time of our meetings from 7.30pm to 1.30pm [for much of the year] so that we can drive home before dark.\"Jane and her friends aren't alone. In a debate at Westminster last October, MPs voiced widespread concerns about bright headlights. Some described social isolation among constituents who had become too scared to drive in the dark.The RAC motoring organisation, which has campaigned on headlight dazzle, has repeatedly asked its members for their views. Most recently, more than half of respondents to a survey of 1,745 UK drivers in January this year felt the problem had worsened in the past 12 months. A third of those who said they were affected by dazzle said they felt less safe when driving at night.Getty ImagesHeadlight glare is an issue for all road users - not just motoristsIt's not only older drivers who feel this way. Emily McGuire from Essex told the BBC: \"I am in my 30s and sometimes I can't tell if [other vehicles'] main beam is on or off and once they have passed, I can't see properly for a good few minutes, it's terrible.\"She owns a smaller car and feels that she can't avoid the lights on higher, bigger cars: \"I suffer with migraines when a car approaches me with extremely bright lights, I have to look down or in the other direction… I also have to slow right down when it's really dark and I'm on a country lane.\"And experts say the problem is getting worse. Denise Voon, clinical advisor at the College of Optometrists - which also campaigns on the issue - says: \"I am a practising optometrist and I've noticed that maybe 15 years ago, you rarely had people coming in complaining about headlight glare. But now it's becoming more and more prevalent.\"It's an issue that has even reached the United Nations - it will mandate all new cars to automatically adjust their headlight levels.But this will only affect new cars. And so the questions many are asking are: what, if anything, can be done about all the cars currently out there causing headlight discomfort - and why did nobody spot that this might be a problem?The impact of changing headlightsExperts believe a number of factors can cause headlight dazzle.One is the angle of headlights. If misaligned, they are more likely to cause glare. Misalignment can cause a vehicle to fail its MoT test.Then there's the fact that headlights have got brighter, to help drivers see better.Headlights have moved a long way from the \"kind of brown glow\" produced by filament bulbs decades ago, according to Dale Harrow, professor of Intelligent Mobility and Car Design at the Royal College of Art in London. They have become more complex and \"a design object in their own right,\" he says.Glass casings have given way to plastic and significantly, the light source has changed too, with most people now using LEDs instead of halogen bulbs, he says - the quality has improved and lights are now \"brighter, but also a lot clearer\".Getty ImagesCar headlights have come a long way since the heyday of the Jaguar E TypeWhile this \"has to be a good thing\" when it comes to helping the driver see clearly, Harrow says, it has also resulted in \"unplanned drawbacks\" - including dazzling other road users.Another problem is the illegal retrofitting of LED bulbs, especially when fitted into units designed for halogen. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency has said it has stepped up a crackdown on retrofit bulbs, with sellers facing potential fines of up to £1,000.\"Recent advances in headlight technology have improved visibility but all headlights – whether LED or not – must still be aimed correctly and checked at the MOT test,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).How bright lights affect our eyesOur eyes adapt in the dark to become a lot more sensitive to light, says Denise Voon. As a result, being suddenly hit by very bright lights can temporarily make it very hard to see, even causing pain.Retinal cells at the back of the eyes which detect the light can get bleached, and take a while to recover. That's when people notice an imprint remaining in their vision after looking away.Although headlight glare does affect younger people, age is thought to be a factor. Older people are more prone to conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma, for example.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThere is widespread concern that glare is getting worse - but the statistics are unclearVoon says there are a number of reasons why LEDs may be particularly problematic. Firstly, they are two to three times as bright as traditional halogens, and their \"colour temperature\" is bluer and whiter, which mimics natural daylight.Also, LED lights \"are a lot more directional, so you've got this much brighter, whiter light in a very directional point hitting your eye compared to the more diffuse halogen ones\".It's not clear if it is the brightness, colour, temperature or the direction of the lights - or some combination of all of these - that causes most problems, she says: \"But what we know is that's one of the differences.\"What the data says - and doesn'tDespite widespread concerns that the problem is getting worse, there isn't evidence that brighter lights are causing more accidents.Statistics from the Department for Transport (DfT) show that headlight dazzle was recorded as a contributory factor in 216 collisions in 2023. Four of those collisions were fatal.Although the overall number of collisions rose very slightly compared to the previous year, it was far below the 330 recorded in 2014. The figure was also lower than any of the intervening years except 2020, when the pandemic meant fewer drivers on the roads.But the fact that since 2024 \"vision affected by dazzling headlights\" is no longer listed in the DfT's published statistics as a contributory factor in its own right, makes comparisons or identification of a trend harder.Equally, these statistics don't tell us whether some people are choosing not to drive at night and nor do they account for other changes in driver behaviour.Still, a government-commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published last year, found that drivers \"perceived glare from vehicle headlamps to be an important and widespread issue when driving at night\".It also concluded that headlamps were perceived as \"too bright\", and that \"whiter\" headlamps and those on larger vehicles were \"generally perceived to be especially problematic for causing glare\".So far so obvious, you may think, based on what campaigners have been saying for some time. But the study went further.Researchers took out a car at night, rigged with equipment to measure light intensity and an observer in the vehicle could press a button if they felt glare might interfere with their driving.The study drew a link between higher levels of luminance - meaning the intensity of light - and the likelihood of experiencing glare. It also suggested that 40,000 candela per sq m - a measure of luminance - may be an \"important threshold for the experience of glare being more likely\".Also, when the research car was travelling uphill or around a right-hand bend, glare was more likely, researchers said - a driver's eyes are more likely to fall within the \"throw\" of headlamps from oncoming vehicles.Echoing the concerns of experts, researchers also found \"some tentative indication that larger body shapes such as SUVs and models with light-emitting diode (LED) headlamps may be more likely to be associated with glare\". However, further research was recommended in this area.The government has since agreed to conduct such further research. But this has not started yet, and it's unlikely to begin for at least a couple of months.An unidentified problemBut all this raises the question of why nobody anticipated widespread complaints about glare - in spite of all the research and development work that's been carried out by carmakers around the world. \"It seems more priority has been put on giving drivers the best possible view of the road at night and less on the consequences for oncoming traffic,\" says Simon Williams, the RAC's head of policy.Manufacturers reject this. \"Safety is every car maker's top priority and providing good visibility to drivers in darkened conditions is essential,\" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT. \"All headlights must meet international standards so drivers can see as clearly as possible but without dazzling other drivers.\"In October, I had the opportunity to speak to Thomas Broberg, senior advisor for safety at Volvo's Car Safety Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden. He explained how vehicles have to meet the standards of countries in which the manufacturer wants to sell them - vehicle manufacturing being an international business.LightRocket via Getty ImagesVolvo says avoiding glare is part of its design processThere are regulations around the headlights themselves, he says, covering their shape, intensity and glare. Also, headlights are tested on the road by different authorities and \"as a global car company, we need to comply with all of them\".Broberg said it was a \"concern\" that people are complaining about glare, but insisted that avoiding glare was part of the design process. He also pushed back against the suggestion that SUVs end up dazzling people more. \"The angle of the light is actually regulated,\" he says. \"So if you have a higher vehicle, then you need to have a lower [beam] angle.\"He argues that road geometry, and poor aiming of headlights in cars that don't have automatic levelling systems, are more likely culprits.What is already being done?In theory, technological innovations should help, particularly auto-dimming - although not everyone finds that they dip early enough.Off the back of the TRL report, the government has promised to look further into design factors that may be contributing to glare. The idea would be to use the findings to propose changes to international regulations at the United Nations.The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has a World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Following an agreement by this forum, new vehicles are meant to have mandatory automatic headlight levelling by September 2027. The effect of this technology is to correct the aim of headlights if the vehicle's load changes.But this would not change the headlight settings on the millions of cars on our roads already.More from InDepthThe TRL report also points out that \"many instances of glare are likely to remain even with stronger regulation\", because real-world situations of \"road geometry\" - the shape of the road, with ups, downs and corners - are not realistically under DfT's control.\"We know headlamp glare is a real frustration for many drivers and is even discouraging some from driving at night,\" a DfT spokesperson says. \"That's why we're investigating the causes as part of our Road Safety Strategy and are pressing for improvements to international lighting regulations.\"There are some basic things drivers can do to reduce the impact bright lights have on them. For example, keep their windscreen clean, inside and out.The College of Optometrists reminds motorists to always wear glasses if they have them, and make sure they are clean. It also advises staying up to date with vision tests, which can also pick up problems with eye health.More practical advice when confronted with bright oncoming headlights is to briefly look to the side of the road, keeping your eyes open - and of course, be considerate of other drivers when you're behind the wheel yourself.For Emily and others affected by glare, this guidance will have to make do for the time being. She says: \"It's tough but we cope and carry on until something is done about it.\"BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRai TVPaolo PetreccaIt was a moment of national pride for Italians watching the glitzy opening ceremony of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics live on state broadcaster Rai earlier this month.But for Paolo Petrecca, whose gaffe-ridden commentary of the event went viral and became a national embarrassment, it signalled the end of his broadcasting career.Petrecca, the head of Rai Sport, has handed in his resignation after his litany of on-air errors broadcast to an audience of 9.2 million viewers prompted a brief strike by news journalists.His tenure will end at the end of the Games, and he will not be commentating on the closing ceremony.Petrecca had been a last-minute stand-in, because the original commentator was dropped for revealing a \"sensational surprise\" element of the ceremony by mistake.He is considered close to the Brothers of Italy party of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and, while running Rai's news channel, presented her book I Am Giorgia to the public a year before she came to office.His broadcast had barely begun before he made his first mistake, welcoming viewers to the Stadio Olimpico, instead of Milan's fabled San Siro which had been chosen for the curtain-raising ceremony.What happened next was described by one reviewer as one of Rai's bleakest ever live broadcasts, when its flagship Rai 1 channel had an audience share of more than 46%.He introduced singer Mariah Carey, before correcting himself and explaining it was in fact Italian actress Matilda De Angelis. AFP via Getty ImagesMatilda De Angelis wrote \"Please call me Mariah\" after the opening ceremonyHis gaffe went viral, as Italians posted images of De Angelis with the slogan \"here's the amazing Mariah Carey!\" De Angelis herself went on social media to suggest sharing the rights to Carey's song All I Want for Christmas.When the camera fixed on President Sergio Mattarella, Petrecca referred to the president's daughter Laura beside him applauding, when the woman in the frame was in fact the president of the International Olympic Committee Kirsty Coventry.When the Olympic torch was handed to Italy's two highly successful volleyball teams, he failed to recognise men's volleyball captain Simone Giannelli, naming one member of the women's team.And he then resorted to national stereotypes, saying Brazilians had music in their blood, referring to African \"voodoo rites\" and Spaniards who were \"always very hot\", using the Spanish word calienti.Petrecca's disastrous performance was condemned by Rai's journalists' union Usigrai as a \"serious blow\" to the public broadcaster's image and the commentator who had been dropped for the curtain-raiser, Auro Bulbarelli, has since been given back the job for the closing ceremony.His decision to hand in his resignation was not unexpected and he will be replaced by colleague Marco Lollobrigida, considered one of the broadcaster's top sport presenters.But the affair has highlighted what critics argue is the government's attempt to pressurise the broadcaster at the expense of output quality, dubbing Rai TV as TeleMeloni.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoe PikePolitical correspondentCivil Service Blog / GOV.UKDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles in three government departmentsPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Dame Antonia Romeo as cabinet secretary, the UK's top civil servant.Dame Antonia will be the first woman to hold the post in the role's 110-year history.She faced multiple bullying complaints earlier in her career but government sources have told the BBC that Sir Keir was impressed by her ability to \"get things done\".The government has previously said three allegations relating to Dame Antonia's use of expenses and bullying of staff when she was the UK's consul general in New York were investigated and there was \"no case to answer\".The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's most senior policy adviser and sits next to them during cabinet minister meetings, which usually take place weekly in Downing Street when Parliament is sitting.They are responsible for ensuring policy decisions are put into action and is ultimately responsible for all civil servants in Great Britain.Dame Antonia has a long track record of leading government departments including spells as permanent secretary at the Home Office, International Trade and the Ministry of Justice.Her appointment was made following a due diligence process overseen by crossbench peer Baroness Gisela Stuart, the First Civil Service Commissioner.Sir Keir said Dame Antonia is an \"outstanding public servant, with a 25‑year record of delivering for the British people\".He said: \"Since becoming prime minister, I've been impressed by her professionalism and determination to get things done.\"Dame Antonia said it was a \"huge privilege\" to be appointed, adding: \"The Civil Service is a great and remarkable institution, which I love. \"We should be known for delivery, efficiency and innovation, working to implement the government's agenda and meet the challenges the country faces.\"Dame Antonia, a University of Oxford graduate, joined the Civil Service in 2000 as an economist after previously working for a consultancy firm in the private sector.Her high-ranking jobs included serving as the UK's consul general in New York between 2016 and 2017.Dame Antonia's job involved promoting UK trade and business in New York, which saw her pictured with celebrities, shortly after the referendum to take Britain out of the EU.Concerns were raised about Dame Antonia's use of social media, with one former colleague claiming in an email that she seemed to be \"focusing an undue amount on building her personal Twitter brand\".Shortest servingSir Chris is the shortest serving cabinet secretary in history.His departure came after months of negative media reports suggesting Downing Street was unhappy with his performance.At the time of his appointment, the prime minister said Sir Chris would be tasked with \"the complete re-wiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform\".As a career civil servant, some questioned whether he was the best person to reform the Civil Service.Sir Chris also had ultimate responsibility for the due diligence checks carried out before Lord Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador, although he took up the role only a few days before the appointment was formally announced.Lord Mandelson was sacked from the role last September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein had emerged.The FDA union for senior civil servants criticised the anonymous briefings against Sir Chris.Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson Lisa Smart, responding to Dame Antonia's appointment, said the public are \"tired of the endless sniping and the revolving door of officials\". She said: \"It's time to stop the Downing Street drama and start delivering for the country.\"Reform UK said it would break the role into three if it entered government.They have proposed: a cabinet secretary responsible for the process of cabinet and cabinet committee meetings; a Civil Service leader; and a chief adviser to the prime minister, who would be a political appointee. Reform UK MP Danny Kruger said the current combined role \"is far too much executive responsibility for a single civil servant, and helps explain the chronic bureaucracy and misgovernment of Britain\".",

    "body": "19 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterGetty ImagesIt's a heated debate in many households - is there a right way stack to the dishwasher?It turns out some of us may be doing it wrong so here are five rules to ensure gleaming dishes - and an end to the dishwasher debate.1. Don't pre-rinseGetty ImagesIf you're rinsing your plates before putting them in the dishwasher you're doing it wrong, says Andrew Laughlin, principal researcher at consumer group Which?Modern dishwashers use a turbidity sensor to detect how dirty the water, and therefore the dish, is. If you rinse everything beforehand, the machine thinks the items are clean and lowers its temperature and intensity, reducing its efficiency.\"Instead, it's far better to scrape leftovers into your food waste bin and regularly clean the dishwasher filter,\" says Andrew.Lynsey Crombie, author of The 15 Minute Clean, agrees: \"Modern dishwashers are built to detect dirt so if your plates are too clean going in, they can actually wash less effectively,\" she says.\"Remove leftover food into the bin, but don't stand there pre-washing. You're wasting water and time.\"2. Stack correctlyGetty ImagesAndrew's rule for stacking the dishwasher is - if you eat from it, put it in the lower rack, if you drink from it, place it in the upper rack.Positioning dirty surfaces towards the jets is important too. \"Face everything towards the centre of the machine for the best performance,\" he says.Lastly, make sure no items are touching so that the water can flow and wash effectively.Lynsey says you should angle bowls downwards so they don't collect water and mix up your cutlery so spoons don't nest together.But the biggest mistake many of us make is overloading the dishwasher, she says.\"If water can't circulate properly, nothing will come out clean no matter how expensive your tablet is.\"3. Place the dirtiest items in the centreGetty ImagesThere's nothing more frustrating than loading the dishwasher, only to find some things aren't clean when the cycle is finished.Andrew says the \"worst offenders\" include cereal, scrambled eggs, or starchy food with protein-heavy residues. To fix this, he recommends putting the really dirty items in the middle, where the spray intensity is highest.This will make the wash more efficient and save you time and money by avoiding putting the same things back in again for another wash.4. Use tablets and saltGetty ImagesDishwashers need a helping hand to reach their peak performance.Andrew says it's \"absolutely\" vital to use tablets as these help to break down the dirt and the food waste and start the cleaning process. They contain enzymes to break down proteins and starches, and surfactants so water spreads and cleans better.Special dishwasher salt, meanwhile, helps to \"soften the water preventing lime scale build up and those horrid white marks on glasses.\" Lynsey says even if your tablet says \"all-in-one\", she still recommends topping up salt \"because it protects the machine long-term\".\"Think of it as maintenance, not an extra,\" she says.Rinse aid dispensers are also worth considering, explains Andrew. These \"disperse the water on the surface of the dishes, helping them to dry at the end of the cycle and to run efficiently.\"5. Avoid certain itemsGetty ImagesIt's equally important to remember what to keep out of your dishwasher, adds Andrew.Non-stick cookware, sharp knives, and wooden items should stay out.\"High temperatures and water pressure could damage them,\" he says.Lynsey says you should avoid anything with adhesive labels as these can clog the filter.But what about whose turn it is to empty the dishwasher?

She was taken to hospital and then discharged but was found hanged at her home a day later.Getty Images/Neil MockfordDonaldson reached the semi-final of Britain's Got Talent with the dance group Kings and QueensDet Con Benjamin Harris, of Hampshire police, led the investigation into the accusation.  He previously told the inquest the person making the claim had said Donaldson had told them that she would take her own life \"if someone finds out\" about the allegation.Harris said he had considered the possibility that Donaldson's reported comments could be a \"form of control\" against the complainant.He said he reported the comments to his senior officers and advised his colleagues, who subsequently arrested Donaldson.Harris said that after the interview he graded Donaldson's risk of self-harm as \"standard\" and said \"she had no indication that she wanted to take her own life\".He added the police did not have the powers to detain someone unless they presented an \"imminent\" danger to themselves.A post-mortem examination gave a cause of death of hanging and found  Donaldson had non-fatal levels of medication in her blood which were consistent with an overdose, the inquest heard.Coroner Jason Pegg recorded a conclusion of suicide.If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story you can visit the BBC Action Line for support.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJonathan GeddesBBC ScotlandCallum LairdCallum Laird fell from Goat Fell mountain on Arran while training for an upcoming ultramarathonAn Ayrshire man has said he is lucky to be alive after falling more than 1,500ft off Goat Fell mountain on Arran - and then running for miles to find help.Callum Laird plunged off the mountain due to icy conditions, and although he managed to break his descent at points by clinging to rocks, the 25-year-old eventually dropped onto a grassy marsh.  He only realised the extent of his injuries when he encountered a woman and her daughter, having left a trail of blood along a hiking trail.Callum was taken to Arran War Memorial Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries. He suffered only superficial burns, a chipped ankle and an injured shin. This article contains images which some viewers may find upsetting.Experienced marathon runner Callum, from Cumnock was scaling Goat Fell last Saturday as part of his training for the upcoming Trans Gran Canaria ultramarathon.He hoped climbing the Arran peak could replicate some of the conditions he expects to find in Spain, but found parts of the mountain covered in ice.He told BBC Scotland News: \"It was when I started to turn back that I went into free fall off the side of the mountain.\"I managed to catch a rock about halfway down. I was dangling off it, trying to find a phone to call mountain rescue, but couldn't find it. I was there for two minutes and already starting to get cold. \"I noticed there was blood there, but I put that to the back of my mind, and decided I would need to aim for the softest landing I could see. \"That was another 800ft or so, and I eventually landed in a grassy marsh.\" Callum LairdCallum's leg was injured after the fallWhen Callum landed he knew that if he remained there, his condition would only get worse, and during the fall his phone had been lost.After checking he had not broken any bones, he hauled himself up and started heading in the direction of the Glen Rosa ferry terminal miles away, intending to travel off the isle.Callum's partner Nicole works at Crosshouse hospital in Kilmarnock, and he planned to go and see her.He told BBC Scotland his memories were blurry about some of the incident, but after going through a couple of river crossings and marshes he got onto the Glen Rosa trail path and started running for about three or four miles.He added: \"I could feel my right ankle starting to seize up but I kept going. I met this woman on the trail, and it turned out her husband is a doctor with the mountain rescue team. \"She was with her daughter and they gave me a cup of tea and wrapped me in blankets – they told me I looked like I was going to die.\"Despite this, Callum was still insisting he would get the ferry and head home, despite being at risk of hypothermia.\"The woman was determined I wasn't, and that I'd go to hospital, and when I got to the car I looked behind and saw this trail of blood behind me.\"Callum LairdCallum suffered burns after the fallIt was only when he reached hospital that Callum realised the danger he was in, as medics rushed to treat him.The following day he was airlifted to Crosshouse, and then discharged that night.His burns are now starting to heal, and will see how his recovery goes before deciding whether he can take part in the Trans Gran Canaria event.However, he is keen that other climbers are aware of the incident and are aware of the risks in climbing a mountain when it is icy.He explained: \"You should always go with somebody or make sure there is someone that knows your route. \"It might seem a bit much but always make sure you have proper equipment, because if I'd had an ice axe with me I could have pulled myself back up. \"I had poles on me but they were no use with the ice. It might be an extra weight, but it could be something that saves your life.\"I can't believe I'm still alive, to be honest.\"",

    "body": "49 minutes agoAmy WalkerReutersThe UN estimates the cost of damage in Gaza at $70bnSeveral countries which have signed up to Donald Trump's Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza \"relief package\", the US president has said.Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US's Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body board originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.  The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.It \"looks like\" Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip. Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had \"agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza\".The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.The enclave's economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed.The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board's first meeting in Washington that \"we're going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we're going to bring them back\".Gaza, the US president said, was \"no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror\". \"And to end that, we have today, and I'm pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package\".\"Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,\" he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and \"just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied\".",

They have already received more than their normal rainfall for February.The one ray of light? This is still well short of the previous longest wet spell in Cardinham of 72 days recorded in 2000.Elsewhere in the UK, the persistent rain over recent weeks has resulted in ongoing flooding with no significant let up expected until the middle of next month at the earliest.Few have escaped the near relentless rainImage caption, Number of rainy days for parts of southern EnglandExeter, Liscombe, Camborne and Okehampton all in the south-west have experienced between 44 and 49 days of continuous rain.

At Ryhill, West Yorkshire it had rained every day for the previous 36, prior to Wednesday.Northern Ireland experienced its wettest January in 149 years, and at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire over half the average rainfall for the entire year has already been recorded.What is it like to live with rain every day? For some residents of Cardinham, the relentless rain is starting to take its toll.Will Palmer, who normally enjoys outdoor activities like walking his dog and cycling, told the BBC that the weather was \"miserable\".It has added further challenges for parents who are looking for ways to keep their children busy over half-term.Laura, mum to Harriet and Rupert, complained that her house \"has never been more full of sopping wet clothes\".She said: \"It's tough when you have a dog and two young children...but you've got to get out there and do it.\"Image caption, While mum Laura has had to deal with sopping wet clothes, Harriet and Rupert have been finding the rain \"fun\"Why has it been so wet?The main reason for the relentlessness of the rain is linked to a \"stuck\" weather pattern that developed across Europe shortly after the New Year.A large area of high pressure became established across northern and eastern parts of the continent, with cold air become strongly established underneath it. At the same time surges of Arctic air in the USA and Canada helped to fire up a strong Atlantic jet stream that directed rain-bearing areas of low pressure towards western Europe. The area of high pressure stopped the progress of the lows, meaning the same areas - namely the UK, Spain and Portugal - have been hit again and again by spells of wet weather.However, this blocked system has meant that some areas of the UK have escaped the worst of the rain. Parts of north-west England and western Scotland have been experiencing 'below-average' rainfall, with some of the Highlands having experienced a stretch of nearly three weeks without seeing any rain.This soggy start to the year reflects long-term trends that show winters in the UK are getting warmer and wetter due to climate change.A warmer atmosphere is able to hold more moisture meaning that when rain comes it is likely to be heavier and more intense.When will it stop raining?This weekend some parts of the UK may experience their first burst of spring 'warmth', with temperatures of 15 or 16C possible in a few spots. However, it doesn't mean that sunshine and dry weather is back.Rain will still feature across the UK during the weekend despite south-westerly winds dragging in milder conditions.The Met Office have said that there is no sign of prolonged dry weather until the middle of March at the very least, with our weather remaining very \"changeable\".Despite this, the blocked weather pattern that has been the reason for all our problems so far this year has finally changed. It means that low pressure systems will sit in different areas and also progress across the UK more than they have done. The result will be a different distribution of rainfall across the country, with some western hills likely to experience the wetter conditions. There should also be a few more drier and brighter days, but with rivers still very high and the ground saturated in large parts of the country any further rain could still bring the risk of more flooding.After the unusually dry conditions through a large part of 2025, and the resulting drought in a number of areas, the turn around to flood has been fairly rapid.",

    "body": "Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. Well fancied American Alysa Liu, who is the reigning world champion, sits third after the short program but revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn is well down the field. Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is second and is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. The standings are led by her 17-year-old compatriot Ami Nakai, who scored a season-best 78.71.But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender? She is fifth after the short program. Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final is the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final, rescheduled from Thursday (12:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.It's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

He had been travelling with a friend as part of his birthday celebrations when on 1 February he was knocked from his bike while overtaking a car.His family wrote in a tribute: \"Our beautiful soft skinned, beautiful long eye lashed boy with a cheeky charming infectious smile that touched everyone's hearts left this dimension early this morning in my arms.\"Kieron DugganEmergency services spent 16 minutes resuscitating Tiger, before taking him to a hospital in Koh SamuiAfter initially being treated at a hospital in Koh Samui he was later transported to the hospital in Bangkok to receive specialist treatment.More than £200,000 had been raised in an online fundraiser to support his recovery.The online fundraiser was set up by friends of Tiger's family, who wanted to support them as they spent time at his bed side. An update posted on the fundraising page said: \"We want to thank everyone that has supported us in Tiger's journey from prayers, messages and donations.\"Without those donations Tiger would not have reached his final destination where following his passing this morning in a selfless act has given three maybe four other people a second chance at life by donating his organs.\"We have had 19 days of living a nightmare, please now respect our peace and privacy.\"More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesRental payments will be reflected in credit scores, one of the UK's main credit agencies has said. Experian said it was overhauling its scoring system to better reflect \"more of the everyday financial behaviours that matter\" which included things \"like paying rent or reducing overdraft use\". The new system will see the maximum credit score someone can have go from 999 to 1250, and will also give more guidance on how borrowers can improve their creditworthiness. Names of Experian's different scoring bands have also been overhauled, with the categories \"poor\" and \"very poor\" eliminated, as well as the use of the colour red.  The bands will now be named Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair and Low. For customers in the low band, instructions are given on how they can increase their score. A spokesperson for Experian said tenants would have to opt in for their rent payments to count. \"As with other data we'll soon be including in the updated score, this reflects that more lenders are now factoring in a positive rent history in their decisions,\" they said. \"Great news for renters who are paying on time, every month.They added that missing rent payments would have an adverse affect on someone's credit score. Credit scores are used as a broad indicator of a borrower's ability to pay back a loan. A low credit score can make it more difficult to take out a mortgage, get a loan, or enter into a hire purchase agreement on a car. Other behaviours the new system is taking into account are cutting overdraft use, avoiding credit card advances and making mortgage overpayments. It will also take a more detailed look at regular payments on mobile phone contracts and how often a customer may switch provider.Experian stressed the changes would not impact on someone's ability to get credit, while eligibility for mortgages, loans or credit cards remains unchanged.The new scoring system will begin being rolled out this month, with a view to making it available to all customers by the end of the year, and will be available on the free version of Experian's service. In the UK, there are three credit ratings agencies, the other two being TransUnion and Equifax - and Monday's announcement makes no different to how they score credit. The changes also mean that borrowers are likely to change the credit bands they are in. The new system means 44% of customers are likely to drop down a score banding after the changes, 42% are likely to move up a banding, while 14% will see their score band remain the same.",

Police  were working to establish the breed of the animal and no arrests had been made.Ch Supt John Davies said: \"Officers are on scene and will be making further inquiries as the investigation progresses.\"Residents said they were in in utter disbelief at the death of the child, with the community in shock and trying to come to terms with what had happened. They said they saw police cars and ambulances on the quiet residential street in south Wales at the time of the incident. By 22:00 the police cordon had been lifted and all the ambulances and most police cars had gone, replaced by scenes of crime investigation vehicles.At this time two police officers were still guarding a house on Crossway, a street now silent but for the hum of cars on the M4 and trains on the south Wales to London line.",

    "body": "An avalanche in Italy's Dolomite mountains has killed five German climbers, including a 17-year-old girl and her father, according to rescuers. The mountaineers, travelling in separate groups, were scaling Cima Vertana in the Ortler Alps at around 16:00 local time on Saturday when the fast-moving snow hit.  A group of three people \"was fully swept away by the avalanche\" and all died, said Italy's Alpine rescue service, Soccorso Alpino e Speleologico.Separately, the father and daughter were carried away by the avalanche and their bodies were recovered on Sunday. Two other climbers in a third party survived.The alarm was raised by the survivors, triggering the rescue operation.Olaf Reinstadler, a spokesperson for the Sulden Mountain Rescue Service, told German media that the avalanche on the 3,545-metre (11,630ft) mountain, also called Vertainspitze, could have been caused by recent snow drifts which had not bonded to the ice below.He said climbing tours were popular and the weather conditions were good, but wondered why the mountaineers were climbing late in the afternoon, as the descent would have then taken until nightfall.The bodies of the three people climbing together were recovered on Saturday before rescue efforts were suspended due to fading light and safety conditions. The Alpine rescue service said that due to fog and low visibility, helicopters could not take off at first light on Sunday.However, once conditions improved, rescuers and avalanche dog units were airlifted to 2,600 metres before setting out on foot.By late morning, the bodies of the two missing mountaineers - the father and daughter - were found.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMost papers lead on the aftermath of the Saturday night stabbing attack on a train from Doncaster to London. The knifeman told police to \"kill me\" after leaving the train where he stabbed 11 people, the Sun reports. Passengers tell the paper he stabbed \"anyone he could\" in the attack, before being Tasered by police officers.The attacker told a passenger that \"the devil is not going to win\" during the rampage, the Daily Mail reports. A passenger of the train tells the Daily Star that she was spared by the knifeman during the \"bloodbath\". The paper is one of several others to also report that the suspect shouted \"the devil won't win\". \"Terror on the tracks\", is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which also reports on a passenger who was spared by the attacker. He stood over Dayna Arnold, 48, carrying a blade, but carried on after she said: \"Please don't kill me.\"Passengers initially thought the attack was a Halloween prank, leads the Daily Telegraph, which also reports that eyewitnesses said the scene was \"like something from a film\". A 32-year-old British national is in custody on suspicion of attempted murder. The Guardian reports a \"heroic\" rail worker who intervened in the attack to defend passengers is \"fighting for his life\". Witnesses describe to the paper a \"terrifying\" 14 minutes during which \"bloodied stabbing victims\" ran through train carriages.The \"hero\" rail worker \"single-handedly confronted the Huntingdon train knifeman\", writes the Daily Express, which also describes the incident as \"one of the UK's most shocking knife attacks\". The suspected attacker was not known to counterterrorism officers or security services, though police say there is no suggestion the incident was an act of terrorism, according to the Times.Extra police officers will be deployed across the rail network this week - especially at major hubs like London, Birmingham, York, Leeds and Manchester - the i Paper reports. Forensic teams wait on the Huntingdon station platform where the train made an unscheduled emergency stop in the front page photo for the Independent. The train attack features on the front page of the Financial Times, but the paper leads on concerns among city bosses that the minimum wage catching up with graduate starting salaries could negatively impact hiring. The warning comes as the chancellor is expected to announce a 4% increase to the hourly minimum wage in the Budget. \"Risky High St baby scans\" is the lead for the Metro, which reports on \"unsafe\" private ultrasound clinics that have sprung up in shopping centres, town centre shops and industrial estates. In one case, a blood clot was \"wrongly identified as a malformed foetus\", after which the mother was advised to have an induced miscarriage, even though the baby was healthy.

    "body": "5 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterThe boss of one of the UK's biggest cinema chains says he does not see streaming services and home entertainment as competition.Tim Richards, the founder and chief executive of Vue International, says film studios tried to \"circumvent\" cinemas during the pandemic but lost \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" as a result.\"I think the studios certainly learned that we are in one small ecosystem, we all need each other,\" he told the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast.Rival cinema chains have a constructive relationship too, he says: \"We are fairly open in terms of trading best practices. We want to have a message that cinemas are a great place to have a good time.\"Richards spoke of the turbulence of the last five years for the film industry. Vue went from having its best year ever in 2019, to being \"effectively closed for almost two years\" during the Covid-19 pandemic, to grappling with actors' and writers' strikes which shut down production for nearly another year.While Richards was trying to figure out how to prevent Vue from going under, or from having to lay off any of its staff, streaming services like Netflix saw their subscriber numbers explode.\"I had a singular focus: save the company and save all of our 10,000 employees,\" he says. \"When you have a mission like that, failure is not really an option, because the consequences are too high.\"Even as cinemas began to re-open, industry figures questioned whether the model of film release had changed for good. Films like Marvel's Black Widow saw minimal theatrical runs as streaming platforms tried to push their original productions.More recently, titles like K-Pop Demon Hunters and The Thursday Murder Club are playing for just a few weeks in cinemas, despite proving to be hugely popular.But Richards is unfazed. Vue returned to pre-pandemic trading levels this year and is expecting next summer to be the company's biggest ever.He is emphatic that there will always be an appetite for the big screen: \"During the pandemic, there was an increase with subscription services because people had no choice...But that has not continued.\"\"I have never looked at what happens in the home as being competition...our biggest, most frequent customers are Netflix subscribers or Disney Plus subscribers. People who love movies love movies in all formats.\"The Hollywood strikes, too, he says, were a supply issue, not a demand one. \"We've never had a demand issue.\"Richards clearly knows the ecosystem of films inside out. Before founding Vue (then Spean Bridge Cinemas) in 1999, he was a senior executive at Warner Brothers, operating the studio's own cinema chain, Warner Village. Spean Bridge bought Warner Village's 36 cinemas in 2003, and the Vue brand was born.\"The headline in the business section of the Times was: 'Unknown Bit Player Buys Warner Brothers,'\" he recalls with a laugh.Due to cost-of-living pressures persisting, many parts of the entertainment industry are seeing revenue slow down as people cut back on discretionary spending.Added to this are rising operational costs: an increase in the minimum wage and higher employer national insurance contributions.\"We have done our very, very best to not pass on those costs to our customers,\" Richards said. \"And we haven't. And we've taken a small hit as a consequence, but we're hoping that the volume which we've seen as a consequence will follow it.\"Still, he says, the entertainment industry has been \"squeezed...and kind of attacked in some instances\".Government decisions have \"hurt the people they're trying to help\", in his view. What's the industry's message ahead of the upcoming budget? \"Please don't touch [us] again.\"And while Richards doesn't believe that streamers are poaching his customers, he says he does worry about \"somebody turning right and going to a theme park or a football game or something else\".But it's not a case of teenagers and young adults sitting at home instead of going out: \"They're a lot more social than previous generations, and that has shown in our attendance with a lot of our movies.\"And what is his own favourite movie?He responds diplomatically: \"I see a lot - a lot - of movies every week.\"But I look at a movie like One Battle After Another. And when I see a movie like that, I have hope for the future because it's such an incredible movie. Original IP, original story, incredibly well done.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "Private baby scan clinics putting expectant mothers at risk4 hours agoJim ReedHealth reporterGetty ImagesSome high-street clinics are putting lives at risk by allowing unqualified non-specialists to carry out baby scans, the Society of Radiographers (SoR) has warned.The trade union says its members have seen examples of pregnant women being incorrectly diagnosed with serious health conditions and given dangerous advice.Other expectant mums have been sent to hospital after being told an abnormality meant they would need to end the pregnancy only to find their baby was completely healthy.It is concerned that anyone using an ultrasound machine can call themselves a sonographer and offer the service - often sold as a reassurance, souvenir or sexing scan - ahead of the routine 20-week NHS check.Dangerous advice\"One time, we had a lady referred [to hospital] from a private clinic, who was eight or nine weeks pregnant,\" says Elaine Brooks, Midlands regional officer at the SoR.\"The sonographer at the private clinic said there was no heartbeat and that the baby was very, very malformed, and they sent her in for an induced miscarriage.\"We started scanning the lady, who was in tears, and on the scan there was a clearly beautiful nine-week pregnancy with a heartbeat. It was absolutely fine.\"A BBC investigation in 2020 uncovered similar failures in the diagnosis of serious medical issues during private baby scans.It heard reports of women who were bleeding and in pain being accepted for scans, rather than being told to contact their doctor.Bad practice and sexual misconductThe trade union, which is also the professional body for medical imaging, says it has seen other examples of bad practice by some private clinics including:Major foetal abnormalities such as spina bifida or polycystic kidneys being missedEctopic pregnancies, where the fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, either not being diagnosed or being falsely diagnosedA radiographer continuing to work as a private sonographer despite having been struck off and banned from working for the NHS due to sexual misconduct The president of the SoR, Katie Thompson, said there were some \"really great\" private services offering checks with properly trained staff, but she was particularly concerned about the growth of pop-up clinics in shopping centres and on high streets selling souvenir images or scans to reveal the sex of the baby.She said she was aware of another case where a private scan late in pregnancy did not record the baby was still breech or lying bottom first in the uterus. The mother was not immediately referred to the NHS and the baby later died. Getty ImagesPrivate clinics often offer reassurance or sexing scans before the standard NHS anomaly scan which is normally offered between 18 and 21 weeks into the pregnancyThe SoR is now calling for sonographer to become a protected job title in the UK in the same way as dietician, podiatrist, art therapist or radiographer.That would mean only those who are properly qualified and registered with a regulatory body would be allowed to use that job description.Many private sonographers are already qualified midwives or radiographers, and  accredited training courses are also available, although this is currently not a legal requirement.Individual sonographers can also decide to join the Register of Clinical Technologists, which the public can then search to see if certain standards have been met, but again participation is voluntary.The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care recently carried out a public interest test of that register and has written to the government to say the \"risks appear sufficiently high\" that it should consider if stronger regulation of sonographers may be needed.The Care Quality Commission which inspects private clinics said many were providing good quality care, but it \"remains concerned that some are not\" with worries over staff training, consent policies and procedures for escalating unusual findings. Where its inspections identify concerns it said it would \"hold providers to account and make clear that action is required to ensure staff are adequately trained\".In a statement, the Department of Health said the safety of patients was paramount and the regulation of all healthcare professionals was kept under review.\"We will carefully consider any proposals from professional bodies regarding this,\" added a spokesman.",

Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.PA MediaAndrew served in the Royal Navy for 22 yearsSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, royal author and journalist Valentine Low said this latest move, to lose his final military title, will be a \"blow\" to Andrew.\"Royals, and particularly Andrew, are very proud and determined to hang onto military titles,\" he said.\"It seems the King is intent on taking absolutely everything away from his brother.

    "body": "11 hours agoPA MediaAlex Salmond successfully sued the Scottish government over its handling of two harassment complaintsThe estate of former first minister Alex Salmond is seeking sequestration – the Scottish legal equivalent of bankruptcy – due to costs linked to court action.Salmond won a judicial review against the Scottish government over the handling of two harassment complaints against him by civil servants which were ruled to be \"tainted with apparent bias\". He was awarded £512,000 in costs.His former lawyers, Levy and McRae, are now acting for his wife, Moira, in winding up his estate.Senior partner David McKie  said \"exposing the unlawful conduct of the Scottish government\" had been \"a matter of great satisfaction\" for Salmond and his wife, but that success came \"at a huge cost\" personally and financially.After Salmond won his case against the Scottish government, he was later acquitted of a series of sexual misconduct charges at the High Court in Edinburgh.Mr McKie said the step of appointing a trustee in sequestration on behalf of Salmond's widow was \"very unfortunate\" but necessary \"to protect her interests and those of creditors\".He said: \"It is a matter of profound regret that Alex had to invest so much time and money in clearing his name. \"But most people will understand that faced with such attacks and an unlawful process brought against him, there was no choice for Alex but to defend himself with every resource available to him.\"This matter will now rightly be passed to the Accountant in Bankruptcy and, if appointed, the new Trustees in Sequestration.\"Salmond died in October 2024 at the age of 69 after suffering a heart attack while attending an event in North Macedonia.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJaroslav LukivReutersLast month's jewellery heist at the Louvre museum was carried out by petty criminals rather than organised crime professionals, Paris's prosecutor has said.\"This is not quite everyday delinquency... but it is a type of delinquency that we do not generally associate with the upper echelons of organised crime,\" Laure Beccuau told franceinfo radio.She said four people arrested and charged so far over the theft that shocked France and the world were \"clearly local people\" living in Seine-Saint-Denis, an impoverished area just north of Paris. Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the most-visited museum, in the French capital, on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenIn Sunday's interview to franceinfo radio, Beccuau said the four arrested people - three men and a woman - \"all live more or less in Seine-Saint-Denis\".She said two of the male suspects had been known to the police, as they each had multiple theft convictions.On Saturday, a 38-year-old woman was charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime.Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy.The suspects - who have not been publicly named - both denied any involvement.Beccuau said the two were in a relationship and had children together, without giving any further details.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Investigators believe four men carried out the daylight theft, and one of them is still on the run.Three other people detained earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the suspects arrived at 09:30 local time (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Ms Beccuau told reporters last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.",

    "body": "Donald Trump has played down the possibility of a US war with Venezuela, but suggested Nicolás Maduro's days as the country's president are numbered.Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"His comments come as the US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.Trump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\". At least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US News partner - reported. Speaking from Mar-a-Lago, Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"Maduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Trump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in. \"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out the Tren de Aragua gang. He called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".It was Trump's first interview with CBS since he sued its parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.He claimed the interview had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic party\".Paramount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.Trump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoKoh Ewe and Mahfouz Zubaide,BBC ProducerAt least eight people have died after an earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, say local authorities, with the toll expected to rise as rescue efforts continue. Some 180 people have also been left injured, Samin Joyenda, a health department spokesman of a nearby province told the BBC. The earthquake struck Mazar-e-Sharif, which is home to around 500,000 people, in the early hours of Monday, at around 01:00 local time (20:30 GMT).It had a magnitude of 6.3 and a depth of 28km (17mi, according to the US Geological Survey, and was marked at an orange alert level, which indicates \"significant casualties\" are likely. Haji Zaid, a Taliban spokesman in Balkh province - of which Mazar-e Sharif is the capital - wrote earlier on X that \"many people are injured\" in the Sholgara district, just south of Mazar-e- Sharif. He said they had received \"reports of minor injuries and superficial damages from all districts of the province\". \"Most of the injuries were caused by people falling from tall buildings,\" he wrote.Mazar-e Sharif is home to more than 500,000 people. Many of the city's residents rushed to the streets when the quake struck, as they feared their houses would collapse, AFP reported.The Taliban spokesman in Balkh also posted a video on X appearing to show debris strewn across the ground at the Blue Mosque, a local landmark in Mazar-e-Sharif.The religious complex is believed to house the tomb of the first Shia Imam - a religious leader believed to hold divine knowledge. It's now a site where pilgrims gather to pray and celebrate religious events.Khalid Zadran, a Taliban spokesman for the police in Kabul, wrote on X that police teams were \"closely monitoring the situation\". Numerous fatalities were also reported in Samangan, a mountainous province near Mazar-e-Sharif, according to its spokesman. The quake on Monday comes after a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan's mountainous eastern region in late August, killing more than 1,000 people.That earthquake was especially deadly as the rural houses in the region were typically made of mud and timber. Residents were trapped when their houses collapsed during the quake.Afghanistan is very prone to earthquakes because of its location on top of a number of fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over three coffins it says contain the bodies of deceased Gaza hostages, according to the Israeli military.Israel has received the coffins, via the Red Cross in the Gaza Strip, and transported them to Israel for formal identification.If confirmed as deceased hostages, it would mean eight Israeli and foreign deceased  hostages remain in Gaza.Under the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal with Israel that started last month, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living and 28 dead hostages it was holding.Israel has accused Hamas of being too slow to return the deceased hostages, while Hamas has said it is working to recover bodies trapped under rubble in the territory.Hamas's armed wing, Al-Qassam Brigades, said the remains had been found earlier on Sunday \"along the route of one of the tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip\".Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official X account said: \"All of the hostages' families have been updated accordingly, and our hearts are with them in this difficult hour. The effort to return our hostages is ongoing and will not cease until the last hostage is returned.\"The Hostages and Missing Families Forum is pressing Netanyahu to act urgently to recover all remaining deceased hostages from Gaza.\"The Hostage Families demand that the prime minister act with determination and firmness in order... to return all of the deceased hostages to Israel's hands,\" the campaign group said in a statement.Hamas and Israel have accused each other of violating the ceasefire.On Sunday, an Israeli air strike killed a man in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.The Israeli military said it had struck a militant that was posing a threat to its soldiers. Under the first phase of the ceasefire, all the living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has handed over the bodies of 225 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 15 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Prior to Sunday, nine of the 11 dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis, one was Tanzanian, and one was Thai.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,500 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Getty ImagesWe all think we know how to brush our teeth - a scrub morning and night, a rinse with water and maybe a minty mouthwash for good measure.But according to dental experts, even the most diligent brushers might be making a few mistakes that could be undoing their good work.Dr Praveen Sharma, from the school of dentistry at the University of Birmingham, says that half of adults in the UK will have gum disease at some point and an early sign is bleeding gums.\"If your gums are bleeding or swollen it's a sign you need to brush better,\" he says. As well as regular dentist visits, here are four things he and BBC's What's Up Docs podcast hosts Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, say many of us are currently getting wrong which if we change could improve the health of our teeth.1. Brushing once well is better than twice quicklyIt's one of the great dental commandments - brushing twice a day - and that's what the NHS recommends.But Dr Sharma says the real key is quality, not quantity.\"If you can find time, then yes, twice a day,\" he says. \"But it's better to do it once a day well rather than twice quickly.\"If you are brushing once a day then he recommends it be in the evening and make sure you also floss.Of course, no one likes flossing, but Dr Sharma says using interdental brushes, particularly rubber ones, can make it easier and less painful. When it comes to the method, each tooth has an outer, biting and inner surface and all three need to be brushed. Dr Sharma advises small circular motions over each surface without applying too much pressure. He also says to pay particular attention to the junction between the tooth and the gum as that's where gum disease can occur.Dr Xand says it's important to \"focus on the sensation of the bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully, not scrolling on your phone at the same time.2. Brush before breakfast, not afterMany people brush their teeth right after eating, but that might not be doing your enamel any favours.\"Ideally, brush before breakfast,\" Dr Sharma says. \"You don't want to do it after something acidic. \"If you do brush after, then you need to leave some space between eating and brushing.\"That's because acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, can soften tooth enamel and brushing too soon afterwards can wear it away.Dr Chris suggests rinsing your mouth with water after eating to get rid of some acid and then waiting at least 30 minutes if you are brushing after breakfast. 3. Don't rinse after brushingIf you've been spitting, rinsing and gargling after every brush, you might want to rethink that last step.\"You spit but don't rinse,\" Dr Sharma advises. Rinsing your mouth washes away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.That means simply spitting out the excess toothpaste and leaving the thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth.4. Expensive toothpaste isn't betterWith shelves full of whitening, charcoal, and enamel-boosting pastes, it's easy to assume the pricier options will give you a healthier smile. But according to Dr Sharma, it doesn't really matter which brand you choose, as long as it contains one key ingredient.\"As long as your toothpaste has fluoride, it doesn't make much difference,\" he says, adding that he tends to buy whatever is cheaper or on offer. Fluoride helps protect enamel and prevents decay, and that's what really counts.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

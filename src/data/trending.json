    "body": "11 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational Editor, KyivBBCOn a dark and cold night in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, the netting protecting the road from attacks by explosive drones shimmered and rippled in the headlights of our armoured Toyota Land Cruiser, as we drove down strange and surreal tunnels to get in and out of the most intensive area of fighting in eastern Ukraine. The nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles around 20ft high along the sides and over the top of the road. Dystopian military vehicles straight out of Mad Max rumble past, encased in their own cages of steel and netting.Nets snag the propellers of attacking drones, making them a cheap and surprisingly effective physical barrier. Even if their Russian controllers detonate the charge they carry, there is a chance that the explosion will not be close enough to kill people using the road in civilian buses and cars as well as military vehicles.Much of the netting has been donated by European fishermen. Only this week the Scottish government announced it was sending over another 280 tonnes of salmon nets that were about to be recycled. Before any of it gets used, the Ukrainian military crashes drones into it to test its strength.In Ukraine, anti-drone nets go on for miles, suspended from wooden poles The three most feared letters on the battlefield are FPV, standing for \"first-person view.\" FPV drones are major killers, used by both Ukraine and Russia. They have cameras that feed information back to their controllers in a command centre that might be 30 or 40km away. We visited a few of them, hidden away in basements of wrecked buildings or nondescript village houses.Inside there are banks of screens, relaying video and data from drones that is analysed by the Ukrainian military's leading-edge software. The cameras zoom in on small figures of soldiers moving around the ruins, with the controllers directing the men on the ground through walkie-talkies, callsigns and headsets. We could see the men entering buildings where the drones had seen Russians hiding, and emerging after they had killed them. Early versions of the drones were controlled by radio signals, but both sides are experts at electronic warfare and quickly found ways to jam them. Now they are mostly controlled by fibre optic cables, so thin that a spool 25km long (that carries data and video) fits into a container built into the drone that is the size of a large bottle of bleach.The nets snag the propellers of attacking dronesEastern Ukraine used to feel like a throwback to the Western Front in World War One, with trenches and dugouts reinforced against artillery and snipers. After the full-scale invasion four years ago it still, for a while, felt like a 20th Century battlefield. But now drones have transformed the way the war is fought, and armies across the world are watching closely, being forced to change their ideas of how to fight.The narrow confrontation line that used to exist between the two sides is now extended across a broad swathe of land that both sides call the kill zone, stretching perhaps 20km either side of the forward positions of the two armies. Rear positions for logistics and dealing with casualties that used to be relatively safe are now as lethal as the old front line. The skies above get saturated with surveillance drones, making movement extremely dangerous. Social media feeds are full of terrifying videos filmed from FPV drones as they swoop into their targets, sometimes chasing down individuals in the open, or even entering buildings, threading their way through rooms and doorways until they find their quarry. The last shot is often of a horrified man about to die.Artillery and tanks are still formidable weapons. But a drone that costs around a thousand dollars can, in the hands of a skilled pilot, destroy a tank that costs $30m (£22m). The Wall St Journal recently reported that a small group of Ukrainian drone pilots created havoc when they were invited to oppose Nato forces in an exercise in Estonia last year. Nato has a lot of catching up to do. One major consequence of the last four years of war is that Ukraine and Russia are now the most experienced and proficient practitioners of drone warfare in the world.Both countries are constantly innovating to get ahead in the drone war. Both have been using Starlink system owned by the world's richest man, Elon Musk for battlefield communications and navigation. The Russians had a recent setback when Musk agreed to turn off Russian-registered terminals active inside Ukraine. That seems to be a major reason why Ukraine, with an active Starlink system funded by Poland, recently recaptured territory in the south.But all the Ukrainian drone units I visited believed that the Russians would soon find a workaround. They respect the skills of the elite Russian drone units they said were called Rubicon and Day of Judgement. A senior officer told me that western Europeans need to forget the military blunders Russia made after the full-scale invasion four years ago and make a distinction between the thousands of front-line Russian soldiers who are killed every month and the elite drone units that Moscow values as a key part of their war effort. He said they were \"cherished\" by the Russian army.FPV drones have cameras that feed information back to their controllersOn my most recent visit to Ukraine, the threat from drones meant we watched the weather forecast closely before heading into Donetsk, postponing during a day of clear blue skies and waiting for more snow. Drones struggle in bad weather.Feeling a little reassured by the nets and the snow, we headed towards the town of Slovyansk, past the ruined shells of buildings destroyed over the last four years. Slovyansk functions as a town, just about, with some cafes and shops open. But  thousands of residents have moved to safer places, and when the people who have stayed go out, their fear of Russian FPV drones means they hurry down the icy, snow-covered streets to get through their errands to make it home alive. Nets are going up in the town centre.Slovyansk is high on Russian President Vladimir Putin's uncompromising list of terms for a ceasefire. A big part of the price he is demanding is for Ukraine to give up the 20% or so of Donetsk it still controls, along with other land that his army has been unable to capture, in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson. According to Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Americans have pushed him to take the deal, to get to a ceasefire by the summer.US President Donald Trump also wants Zelensky to call an election, a demand he has not directed at Putin. The evidence suggests that Trump wants to be able to declare he has ended the war. Even if a ceasefire didn't last, he would treat it as a victory he will take into the US mid-term elections next autumn. He is also eyeing huge business deals with Russia, which cannot happen until sanctions are lifted.The Americans have tried to impose deadlines for a deal. Most recently they told Zelensky he needed to agree to a ceasefire by the summer that Donald Trump could concentrate on the mid-terms. The US inability to bend Ukraine – or Russia – to its will shows that its leverage has limits. Four years after Russia's full scale invasion, there is no discernible evidence that a genuine ceasefire is coming .The dangers in DonetskWhen I saw President Zelensky this weekend in Kyiv, he told me that he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to capture. He would never, he said, abandon the people there, and even if he was tempted to do so it would not work, as within two years by his reckoning, the Russian military would be ready and reequipped and Putin would order them to attack again.The first person we visited in Slovyansk was Oleh Tkachenko, a beefy middle-aged pastor who has built up a remarkable relief operation. He is one of the few people outside the military who travel to the most dangerous areas, delivering bread to outlying villages that he makes in his own bakery, which produces 17,000 loaves per week.After his deliveries he often returns with residents who have had enough of living near the front line. Oleh's bakery is an oasis of order and warmth in the freezing, snow-covered ruins of an industrial area on the edge of Slovyansk.The UN World Food Programme helped him re-establish it when he was forced out of his hometown, which is now occupied. He told me that the dangers in Donetsk have multiplied in the last few months as the drone war has intensified.\"The situation has changed radically. There are only very dangerous places and relatively dangerous places. Nowhere is safe in the Donetsk region anymore.\"I asked him whether Zelensky should give in to Russian and American pressure to sacrifice Donetsk for a ceasefire. It was the same question I put to everyone I met in Slovyansk, and it produced the same kind of answer.\"What more does Putin want? This is my Donetsk region. I was born here. My children were born here. I created my family here. And I should leave all that? What for?\"Putin, he said, should not be allowed to take and keep territory that does not belong to Russia.\"We are destroying the values on which this world is built on one person's whim. Not only will the villain avoid punishment, he [will] also be rewarded? I'm sorry. How many villains like this are there in the world?\"AFP via Getty ImagesZelensky said he could never give up land that Russia has not been able to captureAt a coffee bar I met Oleksii Yukov. He runs an organisation called Advis Platsdarm that collects the bodies of dead soldiers from where they were killed, to honour their memory, and before they get a decent burial, identify them to give their families some certainty about them. Oleksii makes no distinctions between dead Russians and dead Ukrainians, but that does not mean he is also prepared to accept Russian domination in Donetsk. Like Oleh, he does not believe promises made by Putin.\"So if a maniac comes to your home and says, \"Give me your daughter and I won't come back,\" do you really think that a man like this – who rapes and pillages - is simply going to stop?\"\"We all know who the maniacs are, right? It's horrifying. To give away a part of yourself – or your child – to be torn apart… I don't understand why this question is even asked of Ukrainians.\"Oleksii has also recovered the remains of soldiers killed in World War Two in the Donbas, the name used for Donetsk and its neighbouring region, Luhansk, which has fallen to Russia in its entirety. He compares Putin's promises to ones made by Adolf Hitler at the Munich conference in 1938. Hitler claimed that a slice of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland was his last territorial demand in Europe. Britain and France accepted his word as the price of avoiding the World War that started the following year. Like many people in this part of Europe, Oleksii sees parallels with the past.\"Promises made by Russia are worth nothing – just like Hitler's promises that once he took the Sudetenland nothing else would happen. We all saw what that led to: the Second World War. Now it could lead to a Third World War if we do not stop and tell Putin that people live here – people who want to live in their own country, on their own land. Each of them has that right. No Ukrainian has the right to say we can give anything away.\"Oleksii believes that forcing Ukraine to give up Donetsk without a fight would be as much of a betrayal as Czechoslovakia suffered at Munich.Along with its embattled neighbour Kramatorsk, Slovyansk is designated as a \"fortress city\". Both are protected by miles of deep anti-tank ditches filled with razor wire and concrete anti-tank obstacles known as \"dragon's teeth\". The towns sit on a range of hills that is the last high ground before around 150 miles of flat land, mostly fields, that stretch right up to the next natural obstacle, the mighty Dnieper River that bisects Ukraine from north to south. Ukrainians argue that stopping the Russians if they reached the flatlands would be much harder.The BeginningFour years ago, almost to the day, I was at the main railway station in Kyiv, watching a scene straight out of Europe's dark past play out in a bitter wind off the Ukrainian steppe. Kyiv was in the depths of a frigid winter so monochrome that the scene on the platform could have been an old newsreel, but it was 2022 and happening in a technicolour, digital age. It was the loudest warning yet that the world had changed, that old assumptions about European security and the safety of the future had to be forgotten.Since then, other warnings have sounded, in the Middle East, in Sudan and in Taiwan, while the war in Ukraine has incubated the biggest crisis in the North Atlantic alliance since it was created in 1949. The gap remains wide between Trump's openness to Putin and the much harsher view of Moscow held by most European members of Nato.Getty ImagesZelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four yearsIn that first week of the war, the platforms at Kyiv station were packed, mostly with Ukrainian women and children, desperate to board trains going west to escape the advancing Russian army. Russian artillery and answering salvoes from the Ukrainians echoed around the empty streets of the city centre, making the threat to the city frighteningly real. Trains pulled in every 15 or 20 minutes, as many as the endlessly enterprising operators of Ukraine's railway network could find in the sidings and marshalling yards. Frightened people jostled their way on, leaving tearful goodbyes on the platform with those staying to fight. At the height of the evacuation 50,000 people a day were passing through the station.In the station concourse a young soldier with a Kalashnikov slung across his back was hugging his girlfriend before she left to go west and he went back to his unit. They could have been a Norman Rockwell cover for the Saturday Evening Post, the magazine that cheered on Americans after they entered World War Two.Zelensky showed immediately that he was an instinctive war leader, a born communicator who was able to rally his people. On the first dark night of the war, dismissing rumours that he had fled, he appeared in olive green military attire, recording a video selfie in front of the presidency building in Kyiv, with his closest advisors behind him.\"We are all here, our soldiers are here, the citizens of the country are here. We are all here protecting our independence, our country and we are going to continue to do so.\"Getty ImagesUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black SeaThe first months of Russia's full-scale invasion went by for Ukrainians in waves of fear, determination, grief, and patriotic fervour. Some of the Russian soldiers in towns they had occupied around Kyiv carried out massacres – leaving the bodies sprawled where they had been killed on the highway, on the streets of Bucha and in shallow graves. We saw the bodies after Ukraine forced the Russians to retreat from the capital, a victory that confounded the prediction of their western allies that they would be beaten in a few weeks.Ukraine's unexpected strength persuaded the then US President Joe Biden and other European leaders to send more powerful weapons to Kyiv, though never as many or as fast as the Ukrainians wanted. Ukrainians who stayed were volunteering to fight. Those who couldn't set up workshops that churned out Molotov cocktails and camouflage netting.Four years on that energy has dissipated. That should not be surprising. War is all-consuming, and exhausting.It has been replaced by a grim determination to carry on, especially among front line soldiers and their families. Zelensky said earlier this month that 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed in the last four years, accepting that many more were classified as missing. The real figure is likely to be much higher than 55,000. The chances are that their remains are somewhere along the 800-mile front line.Recruiting new soldiers to replace them in the terrible danger of the deadly and expanding kill zone on the front lines is a struggle. In the cities and at checkpoints men of military age face snap inspections of their papers. If they are eligible for conscription, and do not have an exemption from service, they can be driven off to the barracks on the spot.Getting enough soldiers to fight on is one of Ukraine's greatest challenges, yet polls show substantial majorities here believe that Ukraine can fight on, despite Russian advances on the battlefield, and has no choice as they believe Russia wants to destroy them as a nation. A majority also do not believe that the US-brokered talks will produce a lasting peace. But even though a majority believe Ukraine does not have a choice about fighting on, putting on a uniform and heading for the front line is not a popular choice.Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesIn Kyiv, civilians are being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missilesValeriy Puzik, an author and poet, volunteered to fight and has spent months at the front line. I met him in a trendy bar in Kyiv, a world away from the six metre deep dug out he inhabited with his squad at the front line for more than 100 days. I asked him why it was so hard to recruit.\"Because when a person leaves a position, they don't say anything positive. And word of mouth does the worst damage. Because, there is nothing positive there. I wouldn't wish any of my friends to crawl into a burrow and sit there… I was lucky to survive. Usually, people sit in those burrows for 90, 100, 160 days. We were basically supposed to stay there until spring.\"Valeriy survived his latest deployment to the front because he volunteered to evacuate two wounded comrades.Before he could be sent back, his old position was attacked and the men who stayed behind, he says, were killed or are missing. Evacuating the wounded men, he believes, saved his life.\"If it weren't for those injuries, most likely we all would have died there.\"The Long WarUkraine and Russia have been fighting since 2014 when President Putin ordered the occupation and annexation of Crimea on the Black Sea and then seized parts of the Donbas in the east.On this current trip, I have seen no evidence that the war is going to end soon.The full-scale invasion four years ago was Putin's attempt to eliminate the independence of Ukraine once and for all. He has said many times that history shows Ukraine belongs with Russia. A few days before the anniversary of the invasion President Zelensky dismissed that succinctly in a post on X: \"I don't need historical shit to end this war and move to diplomacy. Because it's just a delay tactic. I read no less history books than Putin. And I learned a lot.\"Zelensky has weathered a corruption scandal that forced the resignation last autumn of his chief of staff, Andrii Yermak. He has trenchant critics, and potential rivals, but still has approval ratings of which most western leaders can only dream.Gwara Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022This week, far to the east of Kyiv, the trains that evacuated hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in February and March 2022 are still taking people out of harm's way. The Russia military moves at a glacial pace, but in the key battleground of Donetsk in the east it is grinding forward, chewing up lives, the landscape, and whole villages and towns. Ukraine still holds around a fifth of Donetsk oblast, or region. It is the most intensely fought-over part of Ukraine.One after another, a series of battles over four years have turned towns and villages into rubble, from Bakhmut earlier in the war to Pokrovsk now.Every day buses cross the regional border from Donetsk to Lozova in the Kharkiv oblast, carrying civilian evacuees. A school has been turned into a warm and clean relief coordination centre – packed with families surrounded with a few bags of possessions, dogs on leads, cats in baskets and most of all tormented by loss. Serhii and Viktoria had arrived from Druzhkivka, a town that has been sucked into the kill zone. Their teenage daughter Diana sat silently next to them, with her cat Mika on her lap. Like millions of others displaced by war, here and in other turbulent stretches of the world, they were leaving to save themselves, knowing too well that also meant not just losing the remains of their old lives, but also personal independence. Now they had to sit and wait while the paperwork was done and someone else told them what to do. Viktoria explained why they had left their home.\"We are on the brink. We didn't have any gas, water or power. No heating. We were staying there till the very last moment, freezing for three days.\"Back at the end of 2022, their town, Druzhkivka, was seen as a relatively safe haven when we used it as a base to report the Russian attack on Bakhmut. But no one goes there now, Viktoria says. Druzhkivka is too dangerous.\"The drones destroy everything alive – the cars, the people, their homes. I can't tell you without tears.\"Serhii looked prematurely old.\"It is very difficult. We have abandoned everything we worked for our whole lives. Everything we worked for, for our families, all we were building. And we had to abandon all that in one moment…everything… We could only pack some small things. We could not have taken more.\"Standing near them was Tamara, with her nine-year-old twin granddaughters, Mila and Tina.\"The kids. We left because of the kids. We live near the forest… There are lots of tanks… drones are flying everywhere… there is no peace …the children are running to me and crying… it is very loud…. Everything is shaking…\"Lviv in western Ukraine, where families were send to from Lozova Once they were registered, the families with their bags and their pets were bused to Lozova station, to board a long train heading for Lviv in western Ukraine. Lozova used to be a busy junction for trains heading further east. Now it is now the last stop for Ukrainian railways. The lines beyond it are too dangerous.A defiant UkraineThe talks brokered by Trump's envoys, the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his friend, the real estate billionaire, Steve Witkoff, continue. They are expected to convene again in Geneva after the anniversary of the invasion. Witkoff made positive noises after the last round but both Russia and Ukraine talked about a difficult atmosphere.It is hard to see any kind of ceasefire emerging unless either Putin or Zelensky change their fundamental positions. Since both sides believe they can fight on to some kind of victory that is not likely to change.The negotiations appear more of an exercise in placating Trump, so that he cannot blame either Moscow or Kyiv for their failure. The US president tends to default back to putting pressure on Ukraine. In the past he has claimed, untruthfully, that Zelensky is a dictator who started the war. Zelensky laughed and said it wasn't true when I asked him about it. On the eve of the last round, just before the anniversary Trump told journalists that \"Ukraine better come to the table, fast\".AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Zelensky said if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European supportTrump has ended almost all military aid, but Ukraine still depends on intelligence only the US can provide. Europe buys US weapons, especially interceptor missiles from the Americans on behalf of Ukraine.On this trip to Ukraine I have found a country that remains defiant. It does not feel close to defeat.The big cities function well, despite Russia's concerted and effective attacks throughout this bitterly cold winter on its power and heating grid. In Kyiv, there are traffic jams, well-stocked shops, restaurants and cafés. There are also air-raid sirens, often in the small hours of the morning, and terrible stories of civilians being killed in their own homes by Russian drones and ballistic missiles. Ukraine is rebuilding the military-industrial complex that existed here in Soviet times, concentrating on long range strikes on Russia.Russia has made concerted and effective attacks on Ukraine's power and heating gridPresident Zelensky told me they can win the war, and if Ukraine is to fight on, it will need increasing levels of European support.Spring is in sight, but in this part of Europe winter can drag on into April. Russia has put immense pressure on Ukraine throughout the coldest winter in years by targeting power stations and Soviet-era plants that provide districts with hot water and heat.In the ruins of a power station that the Ukrainians allowed us to visit on condition we did not identify it, workers were salvaging steel from the wreckage. The plant had been hammered by Russian missiles and drones. Repairs were out of the question. It needed to be rebuilt. With his breath condensing in clouds in temperatures double figures below zero, a foreman summed the attitude that is common here, when I asked him why Russia was attacking them.\"They want to make us kneel. They want to bring Ukraine to its knees.\"That is a fact, and Ukraine's determination to stop it happening is why this war continues.More from InDepthTop picture credit: Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "When Aston Martin's new Formula 1 car first appeared in testing at the end of January, it drew admiring glances up and down the pit lane.In its all-black temporary colour, the car not only looked menacing, but also noticeably different from all its rivals. It included the sort of innovations that have become famous from design legend Adrian Newey, installed as managing technical partner at Aston Martin since March last year.But reality bit hard as soon as the car started to run. It was already late, and it managed just four laps on its first day in Barcelona before conking out at the entrance to the pit lane.Aston Martin's fortunes have barely improved since.The car was the slowest in the field by the end of pre-season testing last week, and had done the fewest miles.Team owner Lawrence Stroll looked like the bottom had fallen out of his world as he stalked the paddock in Bahrain, his face betraying a combination of anger and despair.The few times the car was out on track amid myriad reliability problems, it looked a handful for the drivers. Publicly, Aston Martin and Honda were saying little. Privately, no-one was trying to hide the reality. They were in trouble, they knew it, and whatever was wrong - and it was a lot - would take time to fix.It all looked so promisingNo Formula 1 team looked towards the 2026 season with greater expectations than Aston Martin.On paper, Stroll had put together a dream combination, one that seemed guaranteed to produce success.The signing of Newey in September 2024 seemed to be the final piece of the jigsaw the Canadian billionaire was creating to turn his team into championship contenders.In the previous years, Stroll had already inked a deal to become the factory engine partner of Honda, who won four consecutive drivers' titles with Red Bull and Max Verstappen from 2021-24, and two constructors' championships.He had funded a sparkling new factory, including a state-of-the-art wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.He had put together an enviable sponsorship portfolio of boundless resources, including the full financial might of the state of Saudi Arabia, through its national oil company.And in the cockpit was another legend, Fernando Alonso. Ageing, certainly, now he is in his mid-40s, but still without question a major force behind the wheel.The past few years have not been easy for Aston Martin. A major step forward at the start of 2023, when Alonso first joined the team, led to six podiums in the first eight races and what could have been a win in Monaco, lost only to a wrong tyre choice during a late shower of rain.But in the second half of that season the team slipped back, as they failed to keep up with the development rate of their rivals. The same happened in 2024, from a lower starting point, and in 2025 they were simply uncompetitive, slipping to seventh in the championship from fifth the previous two years.Newey's arrival was supposed to herald the start of the turnaround, especially as historically he has aced regulation changes, producing design philosophies that were followed by rivals - in 1998 with McLaren, and again in 2009 and 2022 with Red Bull.The biggest rule change in F1 history for 2026 gave him the chance to do it again, this time for Aston Martin.But the first car produced under his leadership has fallen far short of expectations, and a glance at the context makes this less of a surprise than it appears on the surface.In F1, success comes from stability, and that is the last thing Aston Martin have had in the past few years. There has been major leadership churn, and right at the top, too.This has included new recruits, such as chief technical officer Enrico Cardile, who finally arrived in July after a year on gardening leave from Ferrari.But also casualties. The most recent was Andy Cowell, the architect of the success of the Mercedes engine in the hybrid era. He was installed as chief executive officer only in October 2024, but just over a year later, after a clash with Newey, was demoted to a different role.Cowell is now spending much of his time in Japan, trying to help Honda sort itself out.Aston Martin were already playing down expectations when they had their official team launch in early February, emphasising the project would need time to become successful.Newey has explained that his starting in March left them some months behind other teams in terms of development.The new 2026 aerodynamic regulations were finally officially published on 2 January 2025, two months before Newey officially started work at Aston Martin.In reality, teams have been working on their 2026 cars for much longer than that. The basics of the cars' layouts in the rules had been known for some time, and the teams had all been in working groups refining the detail with governing body the FIA, so knew where they were going.The word is that when Newey arrived in March 2025, he effectively ordered a redesign of the car on the basis of his ideas. So the current car is several months, at least, behind all its rivals in terms of development. With that sort of deficit, even he cannot work miracles.Newey has described the Aston Martin as \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.Right now, in its under-developed form, there is no question it is uncompetitive - slow and unpredictable. It may yet turn out that it can be developed into a good car, but until Honda sorts itself out, it will be hard to tell.Honda's plight has brought back painful memories of a decade ago. When it returned to F1 in 2015 with McLaren, it was underprepared, and spent three difficult seasons with engines that were underpowered and unreliable. The similarities with now are unmistakable.Why it is so unprepared this time is less understandable.Honda officially pulled out of F1 at the end of 2021, when Max Verstappen took a Red Bull powered by their engine to his first world title.It announced its return to F1 with Aston Martin in May 2023.The argument given to explain now being so far behind is that Honda's F1 engine project was essentially disbanded and the engineers involved reallocated to other areas of the company in the 15 months between the two dates.However, it's not like Honda went away. Both Red Bull teams continued to use its engines until the end of last year.Although there was a development freeze, the engine was still being upgraded each year because F1's regulations allowed modifications for reliability reasons. Every manufacturer in F1 uses this loophole to produce performance upgrades in the name of improved reliability.If Honda had not been doing this, it would have fallen behind progressively from 2022 to 2025, which it did not.On top of that, Honda representatives were involved in meetings about the new engine rules all the way through - hence their U-turn on involvement in early 2023.Still, the argument is that without a fully dedicated F1 engine department, Honda lacked a team designing and building a new engine to the revised rules for this year, and had to build one up again more or less from scratch.But so did Red Bull. In 2020, when they announced their decision to build their own engine factory, they had nothing. The original plan was to go into partnership with Porsche, but that deal foundered by late summer 2022.Considering Red Bull had to build a powertrains factory from literally nothing in this period, and recruit an entirely new staff, their timeline is not that dissimilar from Honda's.So why is Honda so far away from where it wants to be? No answer to that has been provided.A new car and engine partnership with Honda that struggles for reliability and performance and has Alonso as one of the drivers. If that sounds familiar, it's because it is.In 2015, Alonso joined McLaren from Ferrari wooed by the promise of Honda's potential. That potential was eventually realised - but not until 2020-21, by which time Honda and McLaren had long since split and Honda had joined forces with Red Bull.Alonso's career, meanwhile, became a kind of living purgatory. One of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known reduced to fighting for scraps, making up his own targets for motivation, rather than what he should have been gunning for - wins and titles in F1.He last won a race in May 2013, and he is now 44. But his performances have continued on a high level, and the respect he has from his peers on the grid is higher than ever. For his talent, and his ability to keep up his motivation in the face of everything.The Newey-Honda-Aston Martin combination on paper promised Alonso something positive, a last hope of a return to success with which to bring his storied career to a close. Either this year, when his current contract runs out, or perhaps after one more, if glory seemed tangible.Instead, he has found himself transported back in time 10 years.Alonso has waited an entire career to work with Newey, the excellence of whose cars - and some terrible luck - have denied the Spaniard at least two further world titles that he should have won.Alonso won't doubt Newey can sort this out. Who would? But after his experiences with Honda last time, can he really convince himself it can turn this around in the limited time he surely still has available?In public, Alonso is staying hopeful, just as he did with McLaren and Honda, bar one or two public slips when it all got too much.\"Everything can be fixed, for sure,\" he says. \"Short and medium term. I don't think there is anything that is impossible to fix.\"We will try to fix everything we can before Australia and after that we try to fix as many things as possible in the first couple of races. Because [otherwise] it's too late in the championship. But no, I'm optimistic. I think there is a solution in place.\"Alonso's partner Melissa Jimenez is expecting their first child in late March.The emergence of the unfolding catastrophe that is Aston Martin-Honda is so recent he has not yet been asked about his thoughts on his future. But he will already be considering what to do.Does he roll the dice one last time, try to summon the energy and commitment to go again after what will doubtless be a very trying year? Or call it quits?",

    "body": "2 hours agoFamily handoutTarryn Baird was 34 years old when she took her own lifeA man controlled his wife through \"physical and sexual violence\", leading to her taking her own life because she could not escape him, a court has heard.Christopher Trybus from Swindon in Wiltshire is accused of the manslaughter of Tarryn Baird, who took her own life in November 2017 at the age of 34.The 43-year-old also faces charges at Winchester Crown Court of controlling and coercive behaviour and two charges of rape, which he denies.Tom Little KC, prosecuting, told the jury that Trybus carried out \"extensive and escalating controlling, coercive and manipulative behaviour including sexual violence of two rapes and other sexual assaults\".More from WiltshireIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.It is alleged that Trybus controlled Baird, using and threatening violence towards her, sexually assaulting her, monitoring her whereabouts, limiting access to finance, threatening to reveal private information to her family and isolating her from her family.\"It took place over a sustained period of time behind closed doors and all of it during the course of a marriage,\" Little told the court.\"It led ultimately in November 2017 to a woman in just her thirties and whose name is Tarryn Baird taking her own life.\"She was the defendant's wife and the prosecution say that the defendant is legally responsible for her death.\"Family handoutTarryn Baird worked in Swindon at an opticiansLittle explained that Trybus controlled \"many aspects of their relationship\" even from abroad using the \"threat and fear of physical and sexual violence\" leading to a deterioration in her \"already weakened mental state and a cause of her deciding that she should take her own life\".He added: \"She had not managed to escape from him, despite seriously considering doing so on a number of occasions.\"A jury heard Baird, who worked at an opticians, left a note to her family which said a \"dark cloud\" was over her. Trybus, a software consultant and developer, denies the charges. He said that Baird had been diagnosed as possibly having PTSD, having witnessed and suffered from armed car-jacking incidents in South Africa.The prosecutor said: \"Other things that Tarryn Baird said about the nature of the relationship were that the defendant had told her parents she was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and that this would prevent them believing her if she told them about the domestic abuse.\"He described this as \"classic domestic abuse perpetrator behaviour\".The trial continues.More on this story",

More sunshine in eastern England and a southerly breeze will make all the difference and here temperatures are expected to reach 17-18C (63-64F). Further north and west there will be more cloud and some rain, but temperatures will still be above average.To put this warmer weather into context - the last time the temperature reached 18C was 13 November 2025, and the record for February is 21.2C (70.2F) on 26 February 2019 at Kew Gardens.Wednesday is likely to be the peak of the warmth this week with temperatures back to near average on the last day on February.Could there be more flooding?Image source, BBCWeatherWatchers / UlaniImage caption, The ground is still saturated in some places after weeks of rainGenerally speaking it hasn't been as wet for the last week or so. However, areas of low pressure and spells of rain will continue to be driven over the UK at times as we head into spring. The wettest weather is expected to be over western hills, particularly in western Scotland. There won't be much rainfall in eastern parts of England - a pattern that is more typical for this time of year.Given the saturated ground in some parts of the UK, the risk of flooding will remain a concern well in to March.Get in touchWhat are your worst weather experiences of the past year?

    "body": "52 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesGPs in England will have to guarantee same-day appointments for any patient with urgent health needs, under a new clause being added to their contract.The government said the changes would ensure everyone who needs to be seen quickly would be.Extra funding is being provided – equivalent to a 3.6% boost above inflation – to help fund the new commitment.But the British Medical Association said the government was at risk of creating unrealistic expectations given how stretched GP services already were.GPs already set aside a chunk of their daily appointments to try to ensure patients who need an immediate appointment can get one.But, currently, there is no requirement to measure how many patients who need a same-day appointment get one.From April it will become a contractual requirement to monitor this and achieve it in 90% of cases. The 10% leeway is being built in to reflect that some patients may not be able to make a same-day appointment or may call too late in the day to be realistically given one. It is not yet clear how urgent cases will be defined.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We are fixing the front door to the NHS. Many more patients with urgent needs will be able to get an appointment the day they contact their practice.\"It marks the latest in a series of changes to the way primary care services work. Last year the government ordered GPs to introduce online booking for non-urgent cases.The boost in funding, which is in line with the wider increase in the NHS budget that was announced in last year's spending review, will bring spending on GP services close to £14 billion.UnreaslisticThis is not the first time a Labour government has tried to set a target for immediate access. In 2000, a 48-hour target was set, but by the 2005 election campaign it was causing controversy, with patients complaining that they could not book an appointment in advance because so many were being held back for quick bookings.The BMA's GPs committee chair, Dr Katie Bramall, said the government was at risk of creating \"unrealistic expectations\", pointing out GP services were already stretched.While the number of GPs working in the NHS has been increasing over the last year or so, the number of patients per GP is still a fifth higher than it was eight years ago.And Office for National Statistics surveys shows only one in five patients believe services have got better in the past year. The majority say they have neither improved or got worse.Dr Bramall said the BMA had not had an opportunity to negotiate with the government about the changes.It's GPs committee is due to meet on Thursday to decide whether it should challenge the imposition of the contract.Chris McCann, of the patient watchdog Healthwatch England, said: \"The new contract will be welcome news for people who have struggled to access GP services.\"Plans to recruit more doctors should make it easier for patients to get appointments and ensure urgent cases are handled more quickly.\"People consistently tell us that GP services are becoming harder to use and that simply getting through the door for care can be a challenge.\"",

Mitula said his comments have been taken out of context.Disciplinary processHe claimed he was defending the Jewish community.The allegations against Mitula were based on information gathered by the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate, apparently from his X account, which he has now deleted.Mitula said: \"I'm confirming my suspension as a Reform member pending investigation. \"The comments in question were taken out of context, and actually defended the Jewish community.\"He added later he had \"no comment\" to make on the racial slur he used in relation to black people.Reform UK said: \"With regard to Adam Mitula, our disciplinary process is confidential and we do not provide a running commentary on any potential cases that are being considered.\"There are more than 76,000 potential voters in the Gorton and Denton by-election spread across Denton in Tameside, and Gorton, Levenshulme and Burnage in Manchester.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAngus CochraneSenior political journalist, BBC ScotlandPA MediaNicola Sturgeon was cleared of breaching the ministerial code in 2021 The Scottish government has released thousands of documents about an ethics investigation into Nicola Sturgeon. Ministers had faced legal action after missing a series of deadlines to produce some correspondence relating to the 2021 inquiry - which led to Sturgeon being cleared of breaking the ministerial code over a botched investigation into her predecessor Alex Salmond.First Minister John Swinney previously told parliament that the request was complicated by the need to make redactions to avoid identifying women who had made allegations against Salmond. Scotland's Information Commissioner took legal action against the government last month after it failed to meet the deadlines.The watchdog is dealing with six different freedom of information appeals relating to the Sturgeon and Salmond inquiries.The government is appealing against two key cases in the Court of Session, including an order to produce some of the evidence considered by independent adviser James Hamilton during his investigation into whether Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. Ministers had agreed to release correspondence with the secretariat working for Hamilton - but said it was taking time to make necessary redactions.The latest release includes almost 5,000 pages of documents, with some parts heavily redacted. Getty ImagesFormer first minister Alex Salmond died in October 2024The row dates back to March 2021, when Hamilton, an Irish lawyer, cleared the then first minister Sturgeon of breaching the ministerial code.A freedom of information request was then made to the Scottish government for all written evidence used in the investigation.The government had originally insisted that as Hamilton was an independent adviser on the ministerial code and he was not subject to freedom of information legislation.However, the information commissioner intervened and ordered the government to look at the case again.Ministers then challenged this decision in the Court of Session, sparking a lengthy series of complex appeals.Last month, after being informed by the government that they would not meet the latest deadline to publish documents, the information commissioner confirmed he would take legal action against the government. When Salmond died, aged 69, he had been suing the Scottish government over a botched investigation into harassment complaints made about him.Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said the government had \"been at pains to try and protect the reputation of Nicola Sturgeon throughout this and have shamefully and repeatedly ignored deadlines from the information commissioner to publish these files\". Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: \"John Swinney and the SNP have fought this every step of the way, spending eyewatering amounts of taxpayer money in court trying to bury these documents.\"The release of these documents is a win for transparency and for the rule of law, but it is shameful that the SNP government had to be dragged to this point kicking and screaming.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoGeorge WrightandCachella SmithPA MediaDavid Lammy delivered a speech on reforming the justice system in London on Tuesday A cap on court sitting days is to be lifted as the government seeks to reduce a backlog of cases, Justice Secretary David Lammy has announced.Every crown court in England and Wales will be funded to hear as many cases as possible next year, he said.Lammy added he is also going to push for reforms including ramping up the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in a bid to tackle the court backlog which currently stands at 80,000 criminal cases.The Criminal Bar Association said it was a \"brave and significant first step\" but the government needs to recruit and retain criminal barristers and solicitors.The bill is yet to go before Parliament. It comes after Lammy announced in December that jury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years will be scrapped.\"This government inherited a justice system on the brink of collapse with victims facing unacceptable delays and we took immediate action to increase sitting days to deliver fairer and faster justice for victims,\" Lammy said in a statement on Tuesday. \"But victims still face intolerable delays. That is why I have agreed with the judiciary to fund unlimited sitting days in the Crown Court next year so they can sit at their maximum and so we can turn the tide on the backlog as quickly as possible.\"Freeing judges to hear as many cases as the system can support \"will mean more victims see justice done - and more offenders face the full force of the law\", the Ministry of Justice said.The government has agreed a £2.7bn funding for courts and tribunals for the next year, up from £2.5bn last year.The Criminal Bar Association welcomed the announcement.\"Complainants, witnesses, defendants, and all who work in the Criminal Justice System, will be hugely relieved as removing the cap on sitting days is the single most important measure which the government can take to bring down the backlog, and reduce the delays,\" it said.But there will be \"further work to do to give effect to this change,\" it said.\"This includes the need to recruit and retain the criminal barristers and solicitors who prosecute and defend in criminal courts.\"Sir Brian Leveson, a retired senior judge, recently released two reports commissioned by ministers as part of an attempt to reverse the backlogs that had reached record levels before Labour came into power, but have continued to worsen since then.In his December announcement, Lammy announced reforms that would include creating \"swift courts\" to tackle unprecedented delays in the court system.He said the reforms were \"bold\" but \"necessary\", but the Conservatives described the plans as the \"beginning of the end of jury trials\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoBrandon DrenonSavannah Guthrie offers $1m reward for information on missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie has announced her family is offering a $1m reward for information leading to the return of her mother on day 24 of the search for the 84-year-old.Fighting back tears, the NBC host said in an Instagram video that they are \"aching\" for Nancy Guthrie, who is suspected to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona.\"We still believe in a miracle, we still believe that she can come home - hope against hope,\" said the presenter.\"We also know that she may be lost, she may already be gone, she may have already gone home to the Lord that she loves.\"In the video released on Tuesday morning, Savannah Guthrie said her family would also donate $500,000 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.She continued: \"Please, if you hear this message, if you've been waiting and you haven't been sure, let this be your sign to please come forward. \"Tell what you know, and help us bring our beloved mom home, so that we can either celebrate a glorious, miraculous homecoming or celebrate the beautiful, brave and courageous and noble life that she has lived.\"ReutersIn a post on X, the FBI's Phoenix office said anyone with \"firsthand knowledge\" of Guthrie's whereabouts should contact the FBI tip line at 1-800-CALL-FBI.Until now, the reward has been $200,000 - $100,000 offered by the FBI and another $100,000 through Tucson Crime Stoppers.Guthrie was reported missing around midday on 1 February after she did not show up for church services.The Pima County Sheriff's Office has said they believe she was \"taken from the home against her will, possibly in the middle of the night and that includes possible kidnapping or abduction\".The family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and asked for proof that she is alive. Nancy Guthrie has difficulty walking, has a pacemaker and needs daily medication for a heart condition, authorities have said.Investigators have released images of the prime suspect - a man captured on Nancy Guthrie's Nest doorbell camera. Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThis same suspect appears to have been at Nancy Guthrie's front door on another occasion before she went missing, a law enforcement source told the BBC's US partner CBS.Purported ransom notes demanding about $6m in cryptocurrency have been sent to media outlets, including one note whose deadline expired on 9 February. At least one note was a fake, allegedly sent by a 42-year-old California man, who has been charged. Massive interest in the case has turned Tuscon - a relatively quiet city popular with retirees - into a global media hub. Dozens of curious observers and amateur sleuths have descended on the area. Detectives have received close to 40,000 tips from the public.DNA evidence was recovered from a glove - similar to one worn by the suspect recorded on doorbell camera footage  - that was found not far from her home, but it yielded no matches in a FBI database, authorities said.Investigators have ruled out all members of the Guthrie family as possible suspects, with Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos previously saying that to \"suggest otherwise is not only wrong, it is cruel\".",

He had not been charged and the BBC now understands he died on Wednesday.  The force said inquires will continue on behalf of the coroner and inquests into both deaths will take place.A woman was also arrested on suspicion of manslaughter in relation to Webb's death, but she was released and faced no further action, police said. Parke had been released on police bail, with no charge brought. More from GloucestershireThe Metropolitan Police said two people had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after his death. The force added he may have undergone a cosmetic procedure before his \"unexplained\" death in London.Jordan James Parke's death is currently being treated as unexplained and an investigation is ongoingA spokesperson for Gloucestershire Police said: \"We have been informed the man who was on police bail died recently, and therefore the criminal investigation will close as no charges can be brought.\"Alice's family has been updated and we hope the inquest will enable Alice's family to have the answers they deserve.\"Webb became unwell following the non-surgical BBL procedure and died hours later at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.BBL is a treatment designed to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted. It can be offered as a surgical or non-surgical procedure.Surgical BBLs involve inserting silicone-filled implants and/or removing fat from other parts of the body before injecting it into the buttocks.Non-surgical BBLs - like the one Webb is believed to have had - involves injecting dermal filler into the buttocks.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesThe racial slur was shouted while Michael B Jordan (left) and Delroy Lindo were presenting an awardA racial slur was edited out of the Baftas ceremony before it was broadcast, but another one aired in error, the BBC's chief content officer has said.Tourette's campaigner John Davidson shouted the N-word when US actors Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage on Sunday. The shout was audible in the broadcast, although many viewers would have struggled to make out the word.BBC content chief Kate Phillips emailed staff on Tuesday, reiterating the BBC's apology for it not being edited out of the broadcast, adding: \"We understand how distressing this was.\"Phillips confirmed other instances of offensive language had been removed, telling staff: \"The edit team removed another racial slur from the broadcast.\"In contrast, the slur shouted when Lindo and Jordan were on stage \"was aired in error and we would never have knowingly allowed this to be broadcast\", she said.The use of the n-word on any BBC television programme is very rare and usually requires sign-off from a channel controller.The Bafta ceremony was shown on BBC One on a two-hour delay, with producers editing the show's length to fit its two-hour broadcast slot.BBC News understands the producers overseeing the ceremony for the BBC were doing so from a TV truck and simply did not hear the slur shouted when Lindo and Jordan were on stage. John Davidson was not on mic or on stage at the time.Phillips added: \"Award attendees were pre-warned about the possibility of involuntary verbal tics associated with Tourette syndrome at the start of the show, and [host] Alan Cumming addressed it during the broadcast. \"Of course, this doesn't lessen the impact and upset.\"How the Bafta racial slur controversy unfolded\"We take full responsibility for what happened,\" Phillips said. \"When I was made aware it was audible on iPlayer, I asked for it to be taken down.\"The ceremony started at 17:00 GMT, two hours before the TV broadcast began.The ceremony was made available on iPlayer after its broadcast concluded at 21:00 GMT. It was removed from iPlayer at around 11:30 on Monday morning.In a statement on Monday, Bafta said it acknowledged the \"harm this has caused, address what happened and apologise to all\".\"Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo were on stage at the time, and we apologise unreservedly to them, and to all those impacted. We would like to thank Michael and Delroy for their incredible dignity and professionalism.\"Bafta also thanked Davidson for his \"dignity and consideration of others, on what should have been a night of celebration for him\".Getty ImagesHost Alan Cumming apologised to the audience for the language heard during the ceremonyAfter the ceremony, Lindo told Vanity Fair that he and Jordan, who were handing out an award \"did what we had to do\" as they carried on presenting, but also said he wished \"someone from Bafta spoke to us afterward\".On Tuesday, Deadline reported that a representative from Warner Bros, the studio behind Sinners, which stars Lindo and Jordan, complained to Bafta in the minutes after the slur was shouted, and reportedly received assurances that their concerns would be passed on to the BBC. Bafta has been asked for comment. In a letter to its members on Tuesday, the organisation said: \"We are in contact with the studios involved and conversations are ongoing.\"Bafta also said it wanted to \"assure all our members that a comprehensive review is under way\".In a statement on Monday, Davidson said he was \"deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning\".\"I have spent my life trying to support and empower the Tourette's community and to teach empathy, kindness and understanding from others and I will continue to do so,\" he said in a statement.\"I chose to leave the auditorium early into the ceremony as I was aware of the distress my tics were causing.\"",

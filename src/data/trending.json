    "body": "Everything you need to know about the Budget4 hours agoGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to increase taxes in the Budget later.Ahead of delivering her Budget statement, Reeves said she will take \"fair and necessary choices\" for the economy, to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living.The chancellor said she will push ahead with \"the biggest drive for growth in a generation\", which will include sweeping investments across many sectors, to build a \"fairer, stronger and more secure Britain\". The statement will be made in the House of Commons at about 12:30 GMT. The leader of the opposition, Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch, will give an immediate response. What has already been announced? The minimum wage for over-21s will go up by 50p an hour to £12.71 in April 2026, Reeves announced on Tuesday, ahead of the Budget.For workers aged 18 to 20, the minimum wage will rise to £10.85, an increase of 85p. The government wants to eventually scrap the separate rate for this age group, creating a single minimum wage for all adults.For 16 and 17-year-olds and apprentices, the minimum wage will increase to £8 an hour, up from £7.55.After the minimum wage went up last year, businesses warned that another increase could result in hiring freezes or job cuts.A so-called milkshake tax has been announced ahead of the Budget.The existing sugar tax, which mainly applies to fizzy drinks, will be applied to bottles and cartons of milk-based drinks, including milkshakes, flavoured milk, milk substitute drinks and lattes. That could add a few pence to these drinks. Or, as has happened with some fizzy drinks, manufacturers may lower their sugar content to avoid the tax.What other tax rises could be in the Budget?According to government sources, Reeves has decided not to raise income tax rates, a move that had been widely expected.However, speculation remains that the chancellor could extend a freeze on income tax and NI thresholds beyond the planned 2028-29 deadline.Freezing thresholds means that, as salaries rise over time, more people reach an income level at which they start paying tax and NI. Some people have to start paying higher tax rates.The chancellor is planning to raise about £2bn by limiting a tax break on pension contributions, the Times has reported.It suggested Reeves could put a £2,000 cap on the amount workers can put into their pensions under \"salary sacrifice\" schemes without paying National Insurance. At the moment there is no limit.It would mean that any contributions above the cap would be subject to NI payments by both employees and employers.For people receiving the full rate of the new state pension, the chancellor is expected to confirm an increase of more than £550 a year from April.This is due to the \"triple lock\", which means the state pension increases by either 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure. Reeves is planning to introduce a new tax on high-value homes in England, both the Times and the Telegraph have reported. About 2.4 million properties in council tax bands F, G and H will be revalued, they said. The tax will apply to properties worth more than £2m, which will affect about 100,000 homes with an average surcharge of £4,500, the Times said.There have also been suggestions that more landlords should pay NI. At present, if being a landlord is not your main source of income, you may not pay any. The Resolution Foundation think tank suggested that all landlords should pay NI at a basic rate of 20% with an additional rate of 8% for property earnings above £50,270 a year.The chancellor is considering a new tax on electric vehicles (EVs). This could help make up for the fall in fuel duty as more drivers move away from petrol and diesel cars. According to the Telegraph, EV drivers could be charged 3p per mile, on top of other road taxes, amounting to an extra £12 on a journey from London to Edinburgh.A government spokesperson told the BBC: \"Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there's no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.\"The Budget is also expected to include an extra £1.3bn in funding for the Electric Car Grant scheme, which offers subsidies of up to £3,750 for eligible models.The government may limit the tax break that people can get when buying a bicycle through the Cycle to Work scheme, according to reports.A limit on how much people can spend on a bike through the salary sacrifice scheme could be introduced, the FT said.The scheme offers savings of 42% of the cost of a bike for higher rate taxpayers and 30% for basic rate taxpayers. A previous spending cap of £1,000 was lifted in 2019.Sturti/Getty ImagesThe chancellor is expected to introduce a new limit on how much can be spent on a bicycle through cycle to work schemesThe chancellor is reportedly planning to cut the amount of money that can be saved tax-free in cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas).Reports have suggested that Reeves could reduce the annual allowance from £20,000 to £12,000.However, cutting the cash Isa limit is unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting investment in stocks and shares, MPs on the Treasury Select Committee have said.The government is expected to close a tax loophole which UK firms argue gives an unfair advantage to foreign online retailers such as Shein.At the moment, overseas retailers can send packages worth less than £135 to the UK without paying import duties, but this would end.The TUC, the umbrella group for UK trade unions, has called for higher taxes on banks and online gaming companies. In September, the chancellor told ITV News that \"there is a case for gambling firms paying more\".What other measures could be in the Budget?Parents can only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children. The rule applies to third or subsequent children born after 6 April 2017.The chancellor hinted at changes when she told the BBC it was not right that children in bigger families were \"penalised\".She could scrap the limit entirely or extend the benefit to all families, irrespective of the number of children, but at a lower level.Mike Harrington/Getty ImagesReeves has suggested that benefit limits on larger families might be liftedThe BBC understands the government could bring down gas and electricity bills by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy, or reducing some regulatory costs which suppliers can pass on to customers.Why is the chancellor expected to put up taxes?The chancellor needs more money in order to meet self-imposed rules for government finances which she says are \"non-negotiable\". The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's official forecaster - has assessed the gap in public finances to be close to £20bn, the BBC understands.How is the UK economy doing?The government has repeatedly said that boosting the economy is a key priority.A growing economy usually means people spend more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises.In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that the UK was set to be the second-fastest-growing major economy in 2025. However, it also predicted that the UK will face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations in 2025 and 2026.Here's what you want to see in the Budget ",

The pair, who married in 1989, had three children and five grandchildren.In a post on Instagram, the Virgin Group founder said his wife was his \"best friend\" and \"guiding light\". \"She was the most wonderful mum and grandmum our kids and grandkids could have ever wished for,\" the 75-year-old wrote. The entrepreneur did not say what caused her death. In his post, Sir Richard wrote: \"Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away.\"He added: \"She was my best friend, my rock, my guiding light, my world. Love you forever, Joan x.\"The couple married on Necker island, owned by Sir Richard, in the Caribbean and had three children, Holly, Sam, and Clare Sarah, who died after four days. Paying tribute to his mother, Sam Branson described her as \"the kindest, most loving, warm and abundantly generous woman to walk this Earth.\"\"I am so deeply grateful to have had the privilege of being your son and being able to call you mum,\" he added.Getty ImagesSir Richard Branson and Lady Branson with daughter Holly Branson and the tycoon's mother Eve Branson in 2013In 2018, Holly wrote in a blog that her mother was raised in the centre of Glasgow and worked in a pawnbroker's shop, and, later, at a London bric-a-brac store in Portobello Road in west London. She said it was there that her father first fell in love with Lady Branson and \"turned up at the shop every day for months, buying stuff he didn't want or need.\"Holly described her mother as \"a stay-at-home mum who was (and still is) always there with a hug, inspiring words of wisdom, and a beautiful, welcoming smile.\"In a blog to celebrate their wedding anniversary five years ago, Sir Richard said he \"fell for Joan almost from the moment I saw her\".\"Joan has always been a steady source of wisdom and has played no small part in some of my better life decisions,\" he added. Sir Richard is one of the UK's most successful businessmen.He founded Virgin Records in the 1970s, before his group expanded into other industries including air travel, broadband and space tourism.",

    "body": "An 18-year-old Central Florida student was found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship earlier this month while vacationing with her family.The family of Anna Kepner, a soon-to-be high-school graduate, is speaking publicly for the first time about her mysterious death and the loss they are grappling with.Authorities have released few details. But a death certificate provided to ABC News by her family states that Miss Kepner died of \"mechanical asphyxia\", with the date of injury listed as 6 November.  Ms Kepner was on vacation in the Caribbean with her father, stepmother and three step-siblings when she was discovered dead in her cabin.Here's what we know about the case.Anna Kepner's body was found under a bed, wrapped in a blanket and covered by life vests, ABC News reported.The death certificate provided to the network by Anna Kepner's family states  that she \"was mechanically asphyxiated by other person(s)\". The Miami Dade Medical Examiners office did not confirm ABC's reporting and declined to provide any more information to the BBC, citing an \"active and ongoing investigation\".The FBI has not named any suspects, and no charges have been filed.Much of what is publicly known about the family's trip comes from an interview Miss Kepner's grandparents gave to ABC news.The family was travelling on the Carnival Horizon, a family vacation that included Miss Kepner's father, one of her biological siblings, a brother, her stepmother, and her stepmother's children from a previous relationship. Her grandparents were also on board.\"We were all having a great time,\" said her grandmother Barbara Kepner. \"I couldn't fathom why anyone would wanna hurt my baby.\"Her grandparents said she was expected to graduate from high school in May and planned to join the US Navy. \"We were looking forward to seeing her grow,\" her grandfather Jeffrey Kepner said.  \"The cruise itself wasn't what made me excited. It was the fact that I was gonna get to spend another week with my youngest son and his family and all the grandkids.\"The Kepners said that the relationship between Anna Kepner and her step-siblings was a happy one, adding there was \"no such thing as steps\". \"It's all family. It's a blended family, yes, but that's not how our family is,\" Jeffrey Kepner said. \"Our dynamic is we're all just family.\"Barbara Kepner recalled that the last day she saw her granddaughter alive, the teenager had complained about her braces bothering her.Despite the discomfort, she dressed up and joined the family in the cruise casino, her grandmother said.Barbara Kepner said her granddaughter told her \"Meemaw, I love you guys, I'll see you later.\"\"And we never saw her again after that,\" she said. Her grandparents are now desperate for answers. \"I now know how she died,\" Barbara Kepner said. \"It helps a little bit, but it's not going to bring Anna back.\"The cruise company told the BBC it is fully cooperating with the FBI's investigation.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSimon Jack,business editorandKevin Keane,Scotland environment, energy and rural affairs correspondentPlans to relax restrictions on new oil and gas drilling in the North Sea will be unveiled on Wednesday under the government's North Sea Strategy.Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce the publication of the strategy as part of her Budget speech, the BBC understands. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will release a document on it shortly after.The strategy is expected to confirm the government is relaxing its moratorium on new drilling for oil and gas in a form in which it can argue the new areas are extensions of existing infrastructure.This idea for allowing new drilling in a way that can be \"tied back\" to existing fields was first floated at the Labour conference in September.The results of the North Sea review will not directly reference the decision being considered by ministers over whether to give the go ahead to the controversial Rosebank field, which Ed Miliband was vocally opposed to while in opposition.That project is the subject of a separate and ongoing regulatory and judicial process. However, the wider relaxation in rules is widely thought to increase the chances Rosebank will ultimately be approved.Tiebacks have historically been used for small remote extensions to existing oil and gas fields which geologically stray into currently unlicenced areas of seabed. Rosebank is a much larger facility which requires its own production infrastructure.There has also been speculation that the windfall tax of 78% - due to expire in 2030 - might be phased out earlier.The oil and gas industry has been lobbying hard in recent months for changes to the windfall tax, or energy profits levy, which they say has been crippling the industry.Investment is at an all-time low with operators instead looking to spend their money in parts of the world with more favourable tax rates.Research from Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen estimates that about 1,000 jobs a month are currently being lost.It is understood the green light for \"tie backs\" would be viewed as a hollow gesture without at least some concessions on taxation.A kind of \"cap and floor\" mechanism would seem like the most likely move from government, which would kick in if oil prices returned to high levels like they did in the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The industry argues that subsequent falls in the price of crude oil demonstrate that the \"windfall\" has now ended and that taxation should reflect that change.",

    "body": "Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered that right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro begin serving his prison sentence of 27 years and three months for plotting a coup after he lost the last election.Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday ruled that the case had reached its final judgement and that no further appeals were possible. Bolsonaro, 70, was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.He will begin serving his sentence in a federal police jail cell in the capital, Brasilia, where he has been detained since Saturday after being deemed a flight risk and removed from home detention. At a hearing on Sunday, Bolsonaro admitted trying to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron until he \"came to his senses\", court documents show. He said he had had no intention of fleeing and blamed medicine-induced \"paranoia\" for damage he caused to the monitor. Justice Moraes on Tuesday mandated that full-time medical care be given to Bolsonaro, whose medical team has previously said he is suffering from worsening health.Supreme Court justices said in September, when Bolsonaro was found guilty of plotting a coup, that he had known of plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes, who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro, whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.Bolsonaro was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.Justice Moraes also ordered on Tuesday that others found guilty of being Bolsonaro's co-conspirators must begin their sentences.They include Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security, and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister.",

    "body": "A parking inspector and his wife have been arrested on suspicion of embezzling more than €1m (£878,000) from a small German town's parking meters.The unnamed municipal employee is thought to have taken coins out of parking meters in Kempten \"on numerous occasions\" and placed them in bank accounts that his wife had access to, local police said in a statement.A money laundering report by a credit institution alerted investigators to the suspected theft. The inspector faces charges relating to 720 alleged incidents of theft, while his wife faces charges of aiding and abetting theft, also in 720 cases.Kempten Mayor Thomas Kiechle said he was \"stunned and dismayed\" by the allegations. In October, the Kempten public prosecutor's office was informed that cash was repeatedly being deposited into several bank accounts, according to the German news agency DPA.Police then searched office premises in the early hours of 24 November, the same day that a 40-year-old man and a 38-year old woman were arrested.They are now being held in separate detention facilities.It is not clear how long it might have taken the couple to accrue the sum.In response to the allegations, Kiechle announced the appointment of a commission to \"review past work processes, uncover potential weaknesses, and reliably remedy them for the future.\"Kiechle noted that the names of the couple could not currently be released due to the ongoing investigation and privacy concerns.In a written statement, Kiechle said: \"I naturally support the public prosecutor's office and the police in their thorough investigation of the allegations.\"\"Until the proceedings are concluded, the presumption of innocence applies,\" he added.Kempten is one of the oldest settlements in Germany. Located in the country's south, it sits under the hills of the Allgäu and has around 70,000 residents.",

In Vietnam, the death toll has risen to 91 in a week, while in Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been forced from their homes.More than 2 million people in Thailand have been affected by the floods, but just 13,000 have been moved to shelters. The vast majority are cut off and unable to get help, according to Reuters news agency.The Thai military, which has been put in charge of tackling the crisis, said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies, along with field kitchens that are said to be able to deliver 3,000 meals a day.Medical teams on board the aircraft carrier will convert it into a \"floating hospital\" if required, the navy said.Boats, high-clearance trucks, and jet skis have also been deployed to evacuate residents, said the governor of Songkhla province, where Hat Yai is located.The cabinet on Tuesday declared Songkhla a disaster zone, freeing up funds for relief.However, many people remain stranded amid the rising waters. A volunteer rescue group, the Matchima Rescue Center, told Reuters it had been inundated with thousands of calls in the last three days, with people asking to be evacuated.ReutersA drone view shows dozens of vehicles at least partially submerged in a carpark Hat YaiPeople have also posted urgent calls for help on Matchima's Facebook page. \"Many people are trapped... Please help,\" one user wrote. \"It's very difficult right now. The water has reached the second floor, where there are children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled!!!\" Another wrote that his household had been waiting for help for three days: \"Every second is crucial now... Please help share. My [phone's] battery is at 40%. Thank you everyone.\"Some also wrote about not having had any food and water for days.A clip that has gone viral on social media shows three young boys hanging from power lines, trying to inch their way to safety while brown murky waters continue to rise below them.In Malaysia, more than 19,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with 126 evacuation centres set up in the northern border areas.In the states of Kelantan and Perlis, rescue teams waded through knee-deep floodwaters to evacuate residents in areas where rising waters had cut off access to roads.ReutersThe Thai military said it is preparing to dispatch an aircraft carrier and a flotilla of 14 boats loaded with relief supplies",

    "body": "4 hours agoBudget day has arrived and its policies, predictions, and preparations fill the front pages of the newspapers. The Sun says Chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce \"new taxes on fun\" and it lists \"work, pensions, houses, taxis, milkshakes, hotel stays\" as areas that will be impacted, with the \"cash redirected to the NHS and benefits\". It adds motorists will feel relief from a likely extension to the \"fuel duty freeze\". Reeves is facing a moment \"moment of truth\", the i Paper writes, as she delivers a fiscal statement while \"caught between the surge of Reform on the right and demands from Labour MPs on the left\". The paper expects the chancellor will lift the two-child benefit cap and confirm an above-inflation bump to minimum wages.The Financial Times predicts the chancellor will deliver a \"tax-raising Budget\" in the Commons later. Her second budget \"will fill a fiscal hole of about £30bn with a series of big tax rises alongside spending cuts\", according to the paper. Freezing income tax thresholds until 2030 and increasing minimum wages are set to feature in the Budget, the paper writes.\"After weeks of leaks, Britain faces a chilling winter Budget,\" is the Metro's lead. Rising taxes could lead to higher costs of \"booze, sugar, nights away, and even your latte coffee,\" the paper says. The chancellor's plea to Labour MPs to \"support my bid to balance books\" also splashes on the front page, urging colleagues to treat the Budget as \"a package – not a pick'n'mix\". The Daily Star reports that the chancellor is \"expanding the sugar tax to cover milkshakes and more fizzy drinks\". The paper's take is the \"chancellor milks us for all we're worth\" adding, for good measure, that it will not offer voters a \"sweetener\".A \"chorus of business leaders and economists\" caution the chancellor an \"inflation-busting hike to the minimum wage threatens to push even more young people out of work\". They warn an 8.5% minimum wage boost for 18-20s will cause a \"spiral\" in employer costs, the paper writes.Reeves promises to \"tackle Britain's cost of living crisis and deliver fiscal stability\", the Guardian says. It writes that the Budget run-up was \"buffeted by a series of damaging leaks and speculation\", describing the stakes as a \"decisive moment for the fate of [Prime Minister Sir] Keir Starmer's beleaguered government\".Expected minimum wage rises leads the Daily Mirror's front page on Budget day. It says the increase, peaking at 8.5% for 18-20 year olds, will \"put more money in millions of low-paid workers' pockets\".\"Smorgasbord budget could cost families £1,600\", the Times posits, as the chancellor prepares to deliver \"more than a dozen tax rises\". A tribute to Joan Templeman, who was married to Virgin group boss Sir Richard Branson, also features on the front page, after she died at 80.Meanwhile, the Daily Express leads with the government's \"plan for judges alone to hear cases where sentences are up to five years\". Critics say \"abolishing jury trials will 'destroy' the justice system, fail victims, and increase the chances of wrongful convictions\", writes the paper. It says the warnings from legal experts reached the ears of Justice Secretary David Lammy, who is considering the proposal as part of efforts to \"slash a Crown Court backlog\".The Daily Telegraph also leads with Lammy's proposal to limit juries to \"cases of murder, rape, manslaughter, and other serious offences of more than five years\". The paper quotes the deputy prime minister's previous argument that jury trials are \"fundamental to democracy\".Finally, the Independent leads with the latest on efforts to broker a Ukraine-Russia peace deal. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is \"'ready to move forward' with European plan,\" the paper writes, calling it a \"significant diplomatic shift\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "11 hours agoSebastian UsherGlobal affairs reporterBBCZeynab Javadli divorced Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum in 2019The former wife of a member of Dubai's ruling family has expressed concern that she could be arrested as her ex-husband has lodged a criminal complaint with local police, accusing her of kidnapping their three young daughters.Since their divorce in 2019, Zeynab Javadli has been involved in a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is the nephew of the ruler of Dubai.It has come to a head in recent weeks as the children have changed hands between the parents several times, with each accusing the other of kidnapping them.Ms Javadli also potentially faces arrest for e-crimes - online offences - after she livestreamed the latest showdown.In going public, she says she realised that she was taking a big risk.\"I knew that it was the last chance to be with my children as they would never let me see them again.  I genuinely believed that it was my last chance, so I just opened a livestream and called for help,\" she said in a video message to her British lawyer, David Haigh.Ms Javadli was speaking from her house in Dubai, where she claims that she and her three daughters have essentially once again been isolated since she took them back with her after they'd been with their father for several weeks. Up until then, Ms Javadli had had effective custody of the children under a deal she says was agreed with the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in 2022. That agreement, she says, guaranteed her custody of the children until they were 18 years old, as well as a house and other assistance. Their schooling has been paid for by their father.In return, David Haigh says she had to sign papers saying that she would - among other things - not speak to the media again about her situation, nor would she do any more livestreaming.A subsequent court ruling granted custody to Sheikh Saeed, but Ms Javadli says she received assurances from those involved in her case that the deal with Dubai's ruler would not be affected.That remained the situation until two months ago.That was when - during one of the regular visitations of the children with Sheikh Saeed - that Ms Javadli says she received a message from him through Dubai police telling her there was no need to wait as they would not be returned to her that day.She heard nothing from them for several weeks. She was finally granted a visitation for three hours at a child protection centre and headed there with her driver on 8 November. She says that when she entered the centre, her children were not there. As she was coming out of the building, she saw them. She says they rushed towards her.She says they were shouting \"Mama, take us from here!\" She told her driver to lock the doors and drive them home.But she claims their way was blocked by cars belonging to people working for her ex-husband. That was when she decided to open a livestream and plead for help. In doing so, she knew that she risked breaking the deal she had signed with the authorities in the UAE and that she could face arrest for doing so, but she insists that it was her only recourse.She has been at home with her children since then and says she does not dare to go out for fear of arrest. The three girls - aged nine, seven and six - have not been going to school.The BBC has contacted a number of officials in the UAE, who are involved in the case, for comment, but has received no reply so far. However, the perspective of Sheikh Saeed is clear from court depositions.The most recent gives a very different version of what happened on 8 November, accusing Ms Javadli of forcibly placing the children into her car with the help of her driver and then kidnapping them. It also accuses Ms Javadli of posting videos on social media in which \"she insulted and slandered\" her former husband as well as defaming the state and violating state laws.Previously, lawyers acting for Sheikh Saeed had claimed in court that Ms Javadli was an unfit mother, who had failed to send her daughters to school, was living in a place unsuitable for the children when she was in a hotel, and that she had put the health of the youngest girl at risk.Ms Javadli rejected the accusations and her Emirati legal team submitted evidence to the contrary in court.David Haigh says that there've been other similar cases involving former wives of members of Dubai's royal family or other female members of the family. He himself has been involved in campaigning for several of the women. None of these cases involve Sheikh Saeed.Princess Haya - the ex-wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - fled the UAE in 2019, saying that she feared for her life. Three years later, the princess won a custody battle that played out in the highest court in the UK, which gave her sole custody of their two children.The most sensational saga was that of one of the daughters of Dubai's ruler, Princess Latifa, who mounted a bid for freedom in 2018 from what at the time she claimed was her family's coercive control.The boat on which she was making her escape was intercepted in the Indian Ocean and she was forcibly returned to Dubai. She then claimed that she was being held captive in secret videos. She has since re-emerged to a limited extent in public, saying that she was well and living as she wished.Ms Javadli and David Haigh say that Dubai portrays itself as promoting women's rights and encouraging women - whether from the UAE or from outside - to lead fulfilling lives, both professionally and personally. For many, this is no doubt the case.But they claim that Ms Javadli's case shows that beneath the glittering surface of Dubai, for some women the situation can be more complicated and more uncomfortable.",

BBC News is not repeating the line in question on the same legal advice.The US president recently threatened to sue the BBC for up to $5bn over the editing of an episode of Panorama.The BBC has apologised for the Panorama edit, acknowledging it gave \"the mistaken impression that President Trump made a direct call for violent action\" on 6 January 2021, the day of the riot at the US Capitol.BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness both resigned in the wake of the outcry over the edited programme.Bregman, who is known for books including Humankind and Utopia for Realists, posted after his first lecture was broadcast on Tuesday, saying the BBC had \"decided to censor\" it.\"This sentence was taken out of a lecture they commissioned, reviewed through the full editorial process, and recorded four weeks ago in front of 500 people in the BBC Radio Theatre,\" he wrote.\"I was told the decision came from the highest levels within the BBC. This has happened against my wishes, and I'm genuinely dismayed by it.\" He said this dismay was \"not because people can't disagree with my words, but because self-censorship driven by fear (Trump threatening to sue the BBC) should concern all of us\".Bregman added it was \"ironic\" that the line had been removed \"because the lecture is exactly about the 'paralysing cowardice' of today's elites\", saying he was sharing his experience in the hope \"that transparency helps strengthen, not weaken, our democratic culture\".Bregman also shared an excerpt of his speech online, in which he referred to Trump as a \"convicted reality star\" just before the short sentence that was edited out.He went on to describe Trump as a \"modern-day Caligula\", saying: \"He surrounds himself with loyalists, grifters and sycophants.\"A BBC spokesperson said: \"All of our programmes are required to comply with the BBC's editorial guidelines, and we made the decision to remove one sentence from the lecture on legal advice.\"When Bregman was announced as the 2025 Reith Lecturer, the BBC said his series, titled Moral Revolution, would \"delve into the current 'age of immorality', exploring a growing trend for unseriousness among elites\".His three further lectures will be released in coming weeks. They are broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in the UK and the BBC World Service internationally, and are also available on BBC Sounds.Previous Reith lecturers include Stephen Hawking, Hilary Mantel, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Bertrand Russell and King Charles III, when he was Prince Charles.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKayla EpsteinReutersTwo of President Trump's most prominent critics secured legal victories on Monday when a federal judge threw out the government's charges against them.For weeks since their indictments, former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James have argued furiously that they are innocent, claiming the president and justice department are merely singling them out for retaliation. US District Judge Cameron Currie tossed the indictments against them because prosecutor Lindsey Halligan's \"invalid\" appointment as US attorney. But she also left the door open for the government to try again.Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general JamesUS judge says government 'missteps' may have tainted Comey caseWhat is ex-FBI director James Comey accused of?Comey acknowledged that possibility after the ruling, saying he believes Trump \"will probably come after me again.\"And White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson seemed to confirm it: \"This will not be the final word on this matter.\"  But the government faces steep obstacles to successfully prosecute either after this setback, and experts hesitate to predict what could happen next due to the cases' unprecedented nature.\"It feels to me like uncharted territory,\" said Kay Levine, Emory University School of Law professor.Could the justice department appeal?The Department of Justice can challenge Judge Currie's ruling before a higher appeals court. In this instance, that would be the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.US Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated she would take this route, pledging to use all available legal action, including an \"immediate appeal\".In other cases, the Trump administration has aggressively appealed unfavourable rulings, taking cases from lower courts and sometimes fast-tracking its requests up to the US Supreme Court.Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing James, vowed to \"continue to challenge any further politically motivated charges through every lawful means available\".In the event of an appeal, the justice department likely would have its own lawyers argue the case, making Halligan's role in the appeal unclear. Could there be new charges?The government charged Comey with making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. Federal prosecutors charged James with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution.Both pleaded not guilty. In addition to arguing Halligan was unlawfully appointed, both also claimed to be victims of vindictive prosecution.With the original indictments thrown out (though, of course, appeals could change that) the government might try to convene new grand juries and secure new indictments.\"As far as everything I've seen, a different attorney could bring James' case to a new grand jury and get a new indictment,\" said Ms Levine.But John Day, president of the American College of Trial Lawyers, said it could be a complicated path - certainly in Comey's case.\"I can tell you it will be hotly contested, whether Mr Comey's case can be re-indicted if a lawfully appointed prosecutor is assigned and is able to secure an indictment.\"He described the tangle of lawyers, judges, and motions involved as a \"procedural morass\" with no simple answers.It might be harder for the government to try to bring the exact same charges against Comey. One problem is the statute of limitations – the deadline that prosecutors had to charge Comey for these specific allegations – which ended at the end of September. However, the indictment's dismissal would trigger a six-month grace period for the justice department to bring the case again.Still in that case, his legal team said it plans to argue the government is out of time.\"The decision further indicates that because the indictment is void, the statute of limitations has run and there can be no further indictment,\" attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said Monday.What happens to Lindsey Halligan?In the pair of rulings on the indictments against James and Comey, Judge Currie was blunt: Halligan was wrongly appointed.Judge Currie wrote in the James ruling that \"the Attorney General's attempt to install Ms. Halligan as Interim US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid.\"Therefore, Halligan \"had no lawful authority to present the indictment\", she wrote.US attorneys are nominated by the president and require US Senate confirmation. Federal statutes govern how people can be appointed on a temporary basis, but Judge Currie found that Halligan's appointment had violated these laws.That leaves Halligan's role on future cases against James and Comey, again, unclear. The ruling also could cast a shadow on any other cases Halligan has brought in the Eastern District of Virginia where she serves.  But Bondi said on Monday that she made Halligan \"a special US attorney\" and praised her work as \"excellent.\"The White House maintained its position that Halligan was lawfully appointed, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.",

    "body": "A mother in New Zealand who killed her two children and hid their bodies in suitcases has been sentenced to life in prison.Hakyung Lee, who was found guilty in September of the shocking murders of eight-year-old Yuna Jo and six-year-old Minu Jo, has to spend at least 17 years behind bars before she is eligible for parole.Lee, 45, argued she was insane at the time of the killings in 2018, which happened soon after her husband died. High Court judge Geoffrey Venning said Lee's mental health played a part in the case, but that her actions were calculated.The children's remains were discovered only in 2022 by a couple who won an auction for the contents of an abandoned storage unit in Auckland.During a trial lasting more than two weeks, Hakyung Lee's defence lawyers told the court that her mental health deteriorated after Jo's death, and that she came to believe it was best if the rest of the family died together. Lee tried to kill herself and her children by giving them a dose of the antidepressant nortriptyline mixed in juice, but got the dose wrong and woke up to find her children were dead, her lawyers said.Prosecutors argued that Lee's was \"a selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\".After the killings, Lee changed her name and left New Zealand. She was arrested in South Korea - where she was born - in September 2022, and extradited back to New Zealand later that year.The court heard on Wednesday how the killings pained Lee's and her husband Ian Jo's families.In an emotional statement read out by prosecutors, Lee's mother Choon Ja Lee  said she regrets not taking her daughter to a counsellor, noting that Lee had \"no will to live\" after Jo died of cancer in November 2017.\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone? Why did she take the innocent children with her?\" Choon Ja Lee wrote, according to New Zealand media reports.Jo's brother Jimmy said he \"never imagined such a profound tragedy would ever befall our family\".His own mother - Yuna's and Minu's other grandmother - still does not know they are dead, he said.\"It was my late brother's will that I protect them,\" said Jimmy Jo. \"This is an ongoing sentence from which I can never be paroled.\"Lee was likely suffering from an \"atypical depression\" and prolonged grief reaction at the time of the murders, according to a psychiatric assessment conducted before the sentencing, local broadcaster RNZ reported.Justice Venning ordered that Lee be treated as a \"special patient\" during her imprisonment, given her mental state.\"You could not cope when [your husband] became seriously unwell, and perhaps you could not bear to have the children around you as a constant reminder of your former happy life, which had been cruelly taken from you,\" the judge said.",

He has got wonderful awareness and he was outstanding before the break.</p><p>King was taken off in the second half when the game was getting away from Fulham, however, and Villa had carved them open a fair few times by the end.</p><p>Bournemouth only rescued a point against Leeds late on last time out - I was wrong to back the Cherries then but I am definitely going to back them at home against Fulham.</p><p>The Cherries edged this fixture <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cjwvv18qw58t\">1-0 at the end of last season,</a> and I am going with the same result and scoreline this time too.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-0</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> We've played both these teams recently, and conceded costly late goals against both of them! I was going to go 2-1 to Bournemouth because they are at home and looked a bit more dangerous of the two, but they were also more organised at the back than I expected, so I don't think Fulham will score. 2-0</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 2-0</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Saturday-4-October\"><span>Saturday, 4 October</span></h2><p></p><div><div><ul><li><p>Elland Road, 12:30 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Fair play to Leeds, they have really surprised and impressed me so far. There is a good balance to their team because they carry a threat and can dig in too.</p><p>Apart from a heavy defeat at Arsenal, they have been competitive in every game so far and their good start would have been even better but for late goals against Fulham and Bournemouth. </p><p>Even so, they have got more points than I expected at this stage and Daniel Farke deserves a lot of credit. </p><p>I think there were question marks over whether he could manage at this level because of his Premier League record with Norwich but, as I've said before, he never really had the squad there to be able to compete.</p><p>Tottenham have had a difficult week, having to fight back to rescue draws against Wolves and Bodo/Glimt, and this is going to be another tricky game for them.</p><p>I can actually see it ending in another draw for Spurs. At least they played in the Arctic Circle on Tuesday night rather than Wednesday but a lunchtime kick-off on Saturday is still far from ideal, and this Champions League campaign is going to stretch their squad.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I asked in my Leeds WhatsApp group about how much can I say we will win by before I sound like a lunatic, and they were all like '6-0' but that is not going to happen! I want to say 4-1 but it will be a lot closer than that too.</p><p>I do think we will win, though, because Spurs don't look that coherent as a team yet. Also, Elland Road is a fortress and the home crowd will just about get us over the line. 2-1</p><p><b>Rod's favourite Leeds players: </b>Gary Speed was a real hero of mine. I am from a Welsh family so he was absolutely my favourite player when I was growing up. Gary McAllister and Gordon Strachan were fantastic too, and a certain Frenchman who was also part of our title-winning team that I can't really talk about now. </p><p>Speed was the one, though, right up until Alan Smith came through - but then he ended up going to the wrong place as well!</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-2</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Emirates Stadium, 15:00 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>West Ham have won on their past two visits to Emirates Stadium but I don't look at Arsenal at the moment and see a team that is going to drop points.</p><p>The Hammers grew into the game against Everton in Nuno Espirito Santo's first match in charge but I am expecting the Gunners to be too strong for them.</p><p>Arsenal are a powerhouse at the moment and their squad depth is frightening. Defensively they are outstanding - they have conceded only three goals in six league games, the fewest in the Premier League - and this should be comfortable for them.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 3-0</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I was trying to be kind to West Ham here, but they have not looked brilliant so far.

The other one was against Burnley in week two, where I went for a draw... and they suffered their only defeat of the season.</p><p>I am going to do the dirty on them this week, and I am going to predict they will win - which obviously means they won't - so apologies to all Sunderland supporters, because they must be absolutely furious with me for doing this.</p><p>I am not just backing them for the sake of it, clearly. They are extremely well organised and everything about them has been impressive.</p><p>Manchester United, on the other hand, are still a mess.</p><p>You can blame Ruben Amorim for that as much as you like but when your centre-half is running out and taking a chance on an offside on a long ball, like Harry Maguire did for Brentford's first goal last week, then that is just terrible defending.</p><p>That's where I feel for Amorim. Altay Bayindir should also have done better with Brentford's second goal and the goalkeeping situation is perplexing too - they have brought Senne Lammens in, but where is he?</p><p>It is just all muddled thinking at United and Amorim is starting to look like a guy who wants to be put out of his misery.</p><p>They are just not improving under him, although he might actually get a result here off the back of me saying Sunderland will win.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 0-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> I am going to sound a bit mean here but you wouldn't expect anything less from a Leeds fan, would you!? I want United to do OK until we play them (in January) because I don't want them to get rid of Amorim. Sunderland miffed me a little bit over the summer because they seemed to sign everyone we went for, but they have looked what I'd call 'solid-plus' so far and I feel like they will cause United some problems. 1-1</p><p><b>AI's prediction:</b> 1-0</p></div><div><div><ul><li><p>Stamford Bridge, 17:30 BST</p></li></ul></div><p>Chelsea's back-to-back league defeats by Manchester United and Brighton have been a classic case of them shooting themselves in the foot.</p><p>If they had kept 11 men on the pitch in both matches it would have had a huge impact.</p><p>So, that's their first aim here and if it's 11 v 11 then Chelsea can hurt Liverpool, even without Cole Palmer, because the Reds are at sixes and sevens at the back.</p><p>I am tempted to go with a draw but this is a big game and I want to be brave and pick a winner. </p><p>AI will probably go for a draw [Sutton does not know anyone else's predictions when he makes his] to try to bore its way to its first win of the season.</p><p>I am going to stick my neck out and back my old team to make it a hat-trick of defeats for Arne Slot.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 2-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Liverpool did not look like themselves against Palace but I think they will come flying out of the gate here and bounce back.

They play Feyenoord in the Europa League on Thursday and their squad is gong to be stretched.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I quite fancy Burnley for a draw here. </p><p>To lose 5-1 last week was harsh on them, and they had frustrated Manchester City for a long time, the same as they did when they were beaten by Liverpool, and that is likely to be their gameplan here too.</p><p>My heart says Villa will win because of my time there - I almost reached double figures in appearances - but my head says Burnley... and, this time, I am going to listen.</p><p><b>Sutton's prediction:</b> 1-1</p><p><b>Rod's prediction:</b> Off the back of beating Fulham, Villa might get that bounce at home and just edge this.

Seeing him back in form is good for England boss Thomas Tuchel as well as for Guardiola, as opposed to last season when he was inconsistent and couldn't find his level.</p><p>I still think City have got issues in a number of positions, however.

    "body": "<div><p>A Texas pastor who founded one of the largest megachurch congregations in the country pleaded guilty on Thursday to sexually abusing a girl of 12 in Oklahoma in the 1980s.</p><p>Robert Morris, 64, entered the guilty plea during a hearing on Thursday, admitting to felony charges of lewd or indecent acts with a child. </p><p>As a part of the plea agreement, the former leader of Gateway Church was handed a 10-year sentence, but will only serve six months in jail and be on probation for the rest of the time. </p><p>He must also register as a sex offender and pay $250,000 (£185,000) in restitution. </p></div><div><p>Morris attended the hearing at a courthouse in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, alongside his wife, his adult children and several of their spouses, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. </p><p>He was handcuffed and detained after Thursday's hearing, NBC News reports. </p><p>The charges stem from Morris' abuse of Cindy Clemishere when she was 12 years old in 1982, according to the Oklahoma Attorney General's office. </p><p>In court on Thursday, Ms Clemishire told Morris through tears that his abuse had \"rippled into every part of her life\", according to NBC News. </p><p>Morris was working as a traveling evangelist and was living with Cindy's family in Hominy, Oklahoma. During that time, she said, Morris abused her for four years. </p><p>Ms Clemishere and her family were in court on Thursday for Morris' plea, according to NBC. </p><p>Ms Clemishire, now 55, first publicly accused the pastor of sexually abusing her in 2024, leading Gateway to announce that he was stepping down. </p><p>He released a statement saying he had had a \"moral failure\" with a \"young lady\". The Oklahoma Attorney General's Office began an investigation shortly after. </p><p>Speaking in court on Thursday, Ms Clemishire said there was \"no such thing as consent from a 12-year-old child\". </p><p>\"We were never in an 'inappropriate relationship,'\" she said. \"I was not a 'young lady' but a child.\"</p><p>She said she had first told her parents and leaders at the church about the abuse in 1987 but no one called the police. </p><p>Morris founded Gateway Church in 2000. At its peak, the group had 100,000 active attendees, with nine locations in Texas and surrounding areas, according to the church. </p><p>President Donald Trump named Morris his spiritual adviser and a member of his envangelical advisory committee in 2016. </p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>Convicted rap mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has written a letter to the judge overseeing his criminal trial, asking for leniency during his sentencing on Friday and blaming his past behaviour on drug addiction.</p><p>In the four-page letter, he apologises \"for all of the hurt and pain that I have caused\" and says that he has been reformed after spending 13 months in a Brooklyn jail. </p><p>The letter on Thursday comes hours ahead of his sentencing hearing at 10:00 ET (15:00GMT) on Friday.</p><p>In July, he was found guilty of two prostitution charges and now faces up to 20 years in prison. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 11 years, but Combs' lawyers are asking that he be released later this month.</p></div><div><p>In his letter to Judge Arun Subramanian, Combs apologises for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, singer Casandra Ventura, writing: \"I literally lost my mind\". </p><p>\"I'm sorry for that and always will be,\" he continues. \"My domestic violence will always be heavy burden that will have to forever carry.\"</p><p>He also apologies to an anonymous woman who testified during the trial under the name \"Jane\" and says he became \"lost in the drugs and the excess\". </p><p>\"I lost my way,\" he wrote. \"My downfall was rooted in my selfishness. I have been humbled and broken to my core.\"</p></div><div><p>Comb's accusers have also written to the judge, describing how he wielded his power and influence to ruin their lives, and their fears that he would seek revenge if freed. </p><p>\"I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up,\" wrote Ms Ventura.</p><p>She added that she believes he deserves a long sentence, writing: \"He has no interest in changing or becoming better. He will always be the same cruel, power-hungry, manipulative man that he is.\" </p><p>In his letter, Combs describes teaching a class to fellow inmates on \"what I did to become a successful business man\", describing himself as a changed person who is now sober for the first time in 25 years. </p><p>\"The old me died in jail and new version of me was reborn,\" he writes. </p><p>Comb goes on to ask the judge for mercy, \"not only for my sake, but for the sake of my children\". He asked the judge to consider his seven kids, and his 84-year-old mother who recently had brain surgery. </p><p>He notes that the judge might be tempted to make an example out of him and instead asks that he be made an example of \"what a person can do if afforded a second chance\". </p><p>Combs is also expected to speak in court on Friday before the judge issues his sentence. Four of his lawyers are also slated to speak, and his defence team also plans to show a 15-minute video. It's unclear what the video may include.</p><p>In July, a jury acquitted him of the most severe charges: racketeering and sex trafficking - which could have resulted in him spending the rest of his life behind bars. He was found guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><p>Prosecutors say he is \"unrepentant\" and argued the rapper should spend a minimum of 11 years in prison. </p><p>\"The defendant tries to recast decades of abuse as simply the function of mutually toxic relationships,\" prosecutors wrote in a 29 September filing. \"But there is nothing mutual about a relationship where one person holds all the power and the other ends up bloodied and bruised.\"</p></div>",

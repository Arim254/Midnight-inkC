    "body": "3 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporterGetty ImagesPauline Quirke is most famous for playing Sharon Theodopolopodous in Birds of a FeatherThe family of Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke have spoken of their \"disbelief\" at her 2021 dementia diagnosis.Although the family are unsure what stage she is at, they said: \"She's still funny, she's talking, she's happy.\"Despite being \"very private\", they told BBC Breakfast they wanted to raise awareness and funds for the condition. \"My mum has always been a charitable person. It's what she would want me to do,\" said her son, Charlie Quirke.Best-known for playing Sharon Theodopolopodous in long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, 66-year-old Quirke was also nominated for a Bafta in 1997 for playing a convicted murderer in BBC drama The Sculptress.In 2022, she was made an MBE for services to the entertainment industry, young people, and charities.But earlier this year her husband, Steve Sheen, who she married in 1996, had to announce her retirement.This ended both her 50-year acting career, along with her role as head of Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, which has about 250 academies, and more than 15,000 young students across the UK.Charlie Quirke and Steve Sheen said Quirke still tells them she loves themSteve said they first got an inkling something might be wrong with Quirke in November 2020, after she received a script.\"She started reading it and she phoned me on that day and said, the words are not going in. That's where it started,\" he said.Their reaction after the diagnosis was \"disbelief, really\". \"We looked at each other and went, 'Can't be, it's long Covid. Got the flu'.\"Charlie added he was \"quite surprised that this was possible in a woman in her 60s, and it can happen to people in their 50s, people in their 40s, so it's something you have to deal with and learn about\".Dementia is described as \"young onset\" when symptoms develop before the age of 65. It most often develops in people between the ages of 45 and 65 but can affect people of any age.Asked what stage Quirke is at in her dementia journey, Steve said: \"We don't know. She's still funny. She's talking. She's happy.\"\"Is it four years, eight years, 10 years, 12 years, 20, who knows?\" Charlie added: \"And that's the problem, no one tells you. \"My mum knows exactly who we are. Every time she sees all of us, she smiles, laughs, says 'I love you', says 'hello'.\"They spoke about why they were sharing their experience, and what they had learned so far. \"Unfortunately we are not in the state where we can do much about it,\" Steve said. \"Just take every day and try and take the best moment out of that day you can.\"It's a long journey. If we can just help a little bit by using Pauline as the catalyst to make more people aware, then we should, to use her to boost awareness and raise funds for dementia research.\" (L-R) Pauline Quirke as Sharon Theodopolopodous, Lesley Joseph as Dorien Green and Linda Robson as Tracey Stubbs in Birds of a FeatherSteve said the impact of the condition hit them slowly. \"It's so gradual that for the first year, two years, you're thinking, ah, she's alright. \"Now, we're three or four years in, it's a little bit different. This is why awareness is important. We didn't know how long it lasts or how long you have with it, or how bad it is or how quick it is.\"Charlie added that it \"progresses and changes every day, but so do we - we change and progress, and so we're forever learning\".The NHS website states dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) \"associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Quirke was nominated for a Bafta for playing murderer Olive Martin in BBC series The SculptressNext month, Charlie is doing a fundraising walk for Alzheimer's Research UK, going 140 kilometres to places that shaped his mother's life, including homes she has lived in, theatres and TV studios she has worked at. It will also include the Buckinghamshire headquarters of her children's drama academy. \"This is my mum's legacy,\" he said. \"This is going to be one of the stops on my trek, because she wanted to nurture the next generation of young actors.\"Steve paid tribute to his wife, saying: \"What you see is what you get. Loving. Brilliant. She's an iconic actress because her talent is immense.\"Charlie added: \"She is an incredible, strong, courageous woman that's been through a lot and she keeps going. \"She's a fighter and it's incredible to see, yeah, very proud of her.\"If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIone Wells,South America correspondent and Laura BlaseyCartel de los Soles, a group the US alleges is led by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, will be designated a terrorist organisation, the US State Department has said.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement on Sunday announcing that the US intends to consider the group a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) from 24 November. It means that Maduro will effectively be designated a terrorist as well, because the US alleges he heads the Cartel de los Soles, an accusation Maduro strongly denies.  It is the Trump administration's latest effort to reduce drug trafficking and put pressure on Maduro, as the US considers whether to take military action inside the country. An FTO designation allows the US government to crackdown more aggressively on the group and its alleged associates, by making it illegal to knowingly offer them support.The US Treasury Department has previously placed sanctions on Cartel de los Soles, but the new FTO designation is an escalated approach which unlocks stronger powers. The Cartel de los Soles is a term used by the US to describe an alleged criminal group involved in activities such as drug-trafficking and illegal mining. Washington claims it is led by the Venezuelan president and includes members of his inner circle, including from the military. The US hasn't published evidence publicly of Maduro's direct involvement in drug trafficking. But its characterisation of Maduro as a drug-trafficker is seen as a way for the US to possibly justify targeting him or those close to him personally as part of its military campaign against alleged drug-trafficking.Speculation is mounting about whether the US may strike land targets inside Venezuela as part of efforts to put pressure on Maduro.In October, Maduro accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the USS Gerald Ford to be sent to the Caribbean.US President Donald Trump has said he has \"sort of\" made up his mind about what to do but has not announced his decision yet.He told reporters on Sunday night that he asked Rubio to discuss the situation with Congress. He added that \"we may be having some discussions\" with Maduro and that \"Venezuela wants to talk\", but did not provide further details on when talks might happen.The Trump administration has taken an aggressive approach toward Maduro, who returned to office in January following allegations of vote-rigging. \"Neither Maduro nor his cronies represent Venezuela's legitimate government,\" Rubio said in his statement. In August, the US government increased a reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest to $50m (£37.2m), alleging he was a leading \"narco-trafficker\".The US has also criticised Venezuela as inadequately addressing cartel activity, which Trump says is responsible for an influx of fentanyl into the US. There is not evidence to suggest fentanyl comes from Venezuela, as it is primarily produced in Mexico with chemicals largely sourced from Asia. The Venezuelan government acknowledges some cocaine trafficking takes place in the country, but there are much bigger trafficking hubs in the region. Cocaine is predominantly produced in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.Since September, the US has carried out a series of airstrikes on boats off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. The US has sent the largest military deployment to the Caribbean in decades and has carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, killing at least 83 people. The administration has previously designated cartels in other countries as terrorist groups.",

    "body": "8 hours agoCherylann Mollan,BBC News and Gopal Kateshiya and Roxy Gagdekar Chhara,BBC GujaratiGetty ImagesPolice say that they uncovered a massive cybercrime racket Hacked CCTV videos from a maternity hospital in India have been sold on Telegram, police say, raising serious questions about privacy and security in a country where such cameras have become commonplace.Earlier this year, police in Gujarat state were alerted by the media to videos on YouTube - some showed pregnant women undergoing medical exams and receiving injections in their buttocks - in a maternity hospital in a city. The videos had a link directing viewers to Telegram channels to buy longer videos. The director of the hospital told the BBC that the cameras had been installed for the safety of doctors. The BBC is not naming the city or hospital to protect the identity of the women in the videos. None of them have filed a police complaint.Police say their investigation uncovered a massive cybercrime racket where sensitive footage from at least 50,000 CCTVs from across the country was stolen by hackers and sold on the internet.CCTVs have become ubiquitous in India, especially in urban areas. They are installed in malls, offices, hospitals, schools, private apartment complexes and even inside people's homes.Experts warn that while CCTV boosts security, poorly installed or managed systems can threaten privacy. In India, cameras are often handled by staff without cybersecurity training, and some domestically manufactured models are reportedly easily exploitable.In 2018, a tech worker in Bengaluru city said that his webcam was hacked, and that the hacker demanded payment in exchange for not sharing his private videos. In 2023, a YouTuber reportedly found out that his home CCTV had been hacked after private videos went viral.Last year, the federal government asked states to not procure CCTVs from suppliers with a history of security and data breaches and also introduced new rules to improve cyber security of CCTV cameras. But hacking incidents like these are still reported.Getty ImagesCCTV cameras are ubiquitous in IndiaIn Gujarat, police say they ended up discovering a \"network of individuals spread across the country\".\"[They] were hacking into the video surveillance systems - or CCTV systems - of hospitals, schools, colleges, corporate offices and even the bedrooms of private individuals in multiple states,\" Lavina Sinha, who heads the Ahmedabad cyber crime department investigating the case, told reporters.Hardik Makadiya, Gujarat's top cybercrime official, says videos were sold for 800–2,000 rupees  ($9-22; £7-17, with Telegram channels offering live CCTV feeds via subscription.Police have registered a case under various sections of the law, including violating a female patient's privacy, publishing obscene material, voyeurism and cyber terrorism - which is a non-bailable offence. They say that they reached out to Telegram and YouTube, and the videos have been taken down.Since February, police have arrested eight people in the case - four from Maharashtra and others from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. They remain in judicial custody as the case proceeds in court.CCTV: Why do so many Indians love surveillance?Yash Koshti, lawyer for three of the accused, denied the allegations, saying they were not hackers or cyber criminals and that someone else carried out the breach.Cybercrime investigator Ritesh Bhatia warns that weakly protected CCTV and home networks are easy targets and must be properly secured.\"Wireless CCTV systems help you access the footage remotely, like on your smartphone or laptop. But once a system is connected to the web, it's easy for hackers to decode its IP address and default password. And once they get into the system, they can see or record live footage, download it or even shut down the system,\" Mr Bhatia says.He says that one way to secure surveillance systems is to change IP addresses and the default password.Mr Bhatia advises using a robust password that mixes letters, numbers, and symbols and cannot be found in a dictionary, and recommends periodic audits by a cybersecurity professional.He adds that CCTV manufacturers also bear responsibility, and their packaging should clearly warn users to replace default passwords with strong ones - similar to cigarette packet health warnings.Getty ImagesA CCTV surveillance sign in Tamil Nadu; such signs are common across IndiaMr Makadiya told the BBC that many of the hacked CCTVs used default passwords - like Admin123 - or weak ones.\"The hackers used brute force (the use of certain programmes to generate thousands of letter-number password combinations) to break into these systems and access videos,\" he said.Audrey Dmello of Majlis, a legal centre for women's and children's rights, highlights the ubiquity of CCTVs in India, often installed without consent. She urges organisations, especially in sensitive spaces, to ensure their systems are properly secured.\"Organisations and institutions that set up surveillance systems, especially in sensitive spaces, must see to it that their systems are adequately secured. It's an absolute must,\" she says.The director of one of the affected hospitals told the BBC the CCTVs in exam and injection rooms were meant to protect doctors from false allegations. He added that the cameras have since been removed from sensitive areas.Police in Gujarat told the BBC that neither the hospital nor any patient had come forward to file a formal complaint. The complaint was finally lodged by a police officer.\"Female patients fear that their identity will be revealed. Therefore, they are not willing to lodge a complaint,\" said an officer.Ms Dmello says that the shame women face around such incidents only adds to its horrific nature.\"When there is a sexual angle involved, the victim is re-victimised because of the patriarchal nature of Indian society. If we want women to assert their rights and we want criminals to be brought to justice, we, as a society, should first stop shaming and blaming women for the crime,\" she says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "Luke Littler celebrated becoming world number one for the first time by beating Luke Humphries, the man he has surpassed, to win the Grand Slam of Darts with a 16-11 victory in Wolverhampton.The world champion's 16-9 victory over the Netherlands' Danny Noppert in the semi-final meant he would overtake Humphries to top the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) world rankings regardless of the result of Sunday evening's final.But Littler emphasised his ascension to the world darts summit as he surged to victory by winning 10 of the last 13 legs against his great rival to retain the title - and stay unbeaten in the Grand Slam.At just 18, Littler is the youngest PDC world number one, surpassing Michael van Gerwen, who achieved the feat aged 24 in 2014.\"I am the best in the world, I can finally say it,\" Littler said after the final.\"World number one, you are the best in the world. To top it off by going back-to-back here makes it even more special.\"Now I'm number one, I'm hungry to stay there. I want to be there for the next few years.\"There's going to be a target on my back from Luke and all the other players. It's made me more hungry.\"The final ebbed and flowed, with Littler quickly going 2-0 up before Humphries won four on the spin to lead 4-2.Humphries retained the edge until a brilliant 167 checkout saw 'The Nuke' break back for 8-8.The decisive moment came with Littler leading 10-9 when Humphries, well in control of the leg, chose to go for a 170 out, missed and then fluffed his set-up on his next visit.That gave Littler a glimmer of hope with a 160 finish. He made no mistake to go 11-9 up and never looked back.Littler's earnings over the two-year period that determine the Order of Merit totalled £1,770,500 after making the final, with his victory taking it up to £1,850,000.As Humphries was defending the money he won from triumphing in this tournament in 2023, even if had he lifted the trophy again, he would have earned £1,769,000 - just short of his fellow Englishman.The rankings are determined by the amount of prize money a player has won from ranking tournaments over a two-year period.\"Being world number one is some achievement for Luke Littler and doing it in less than two years is something remarkable,\" former BDO world champion Mark Webster told Sky Sports.\"He knows how to get it done. He doesn't have bad spells - he does lose in some tournaments and it will continue to happen - but he's just a brilliant talent.\"In the semi-finals, Littler had to overcome a sluggish start of his own and a blistering one from Noppert and found himself 8-6 down.However, just as he would in the final, he rallied in impressive style, winning 10 of the next 11 legs and ending with an average of 102.62 to complete his rise to the summit of world darts.Humphries had clung on to the number one spot for a little longer with a magnificent display to beat Gerwyn Price 16-13 in an enthralling first semi-final.The 2024 world champion averaged 106.25 and hit 16 180s - and with the rankings not officially updating until after the final, gave himself one more match as world number one.Despite losing his world number one status and another defeat by Littler, following his loss in the World Grand Prix final in October, Humphries was in bullish mood after the match.With the start of the World Championships less than a month away, the 30-year-old is motivated to get himself back on top.\"I am going to win the Worlds,\" he told Sky Sports.\"I am declaring war on him. I'm playing good. Tiredness just crept in at the end there. We're going to go to war at the World Championships, we'll see who is the one there.\"Asked if he thinks he and Littler are in a league of their own, Humphries added: \"Yeah, I do. I don't feel arrogant saying that. What can us two do? We're on opposite sides of the draw and people can stop us.\"I am trying to stop him and I can't. It is up to everyone else to stop us. At the moment us two are playing a level of this sport that is better than everyone else.\"I want to play another world final against him.\"But Littler was not going to back down from the challenge, and agreed that there is a sizeable gap between the world's top two and the rest.\"It definitely is war because if someone takes it off you then you want it back. You don't want to be second,\" he said.\"I think we are [in different league from the rest]. The finals show it, the stats show it and like Luke said, if everyone is getting bored of me and him then someone needs to stop us otherwise we're going to keep winning.\"One and two, we're going to meet in the final if we get past our opponents. Long may it continue.\"Me and Luke have sort of done the same in titles. Now I've got the number one spot and he wants it back. We're going to be battling even more, I think we're going to be playing well because obviously he wants it back and I don't want to give it away.\"You're going to see many more great games.\"",

And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "Mysterious drones have been spotted at night at airports across Europe. How worried should we be?8 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondent BBCFirst comes the warning, that disembodied voice over the tannoy: \"Your attention please. Air siren in the city. Please move to the shelter on the minus second floor.\" Then comes the mosquito-like whine of the incoming Russian drones, massing in their hundreds just above the clouds.It's followed immediately by the rattle of anti-aircraft fire, the distant thud of explosions, then finally the ominous klaxon call of ambulance and fire sirens.This is the grim reality of night time in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine.These are attack drones that explode on impact. Drones are now an integral part of modern warfare, but they are not confined to the battlefield.Across western Europe, far from Ukraine, unarmed drones have also been found buzzing around airports, military bases and power plants, all part of a suspected programme of \"hybrid warfare\" being waged by Russia, with some speculating they're arriving to test the resilience of certain Nato countries that are helping Ukraine.ReutersDrone sightings around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium, have sparked fear in a number of Nato countriesRecent drone sightings in Poland, along with a swathe spotted around critical infrastructure across Europe, including in Belgium and Denmark, have sparked fear across some Nato countries. Now, there is talk that a \"drone wall\" is to be designed to protect parts of Europe - but just how necessary is this, really? And more pertinently, how realistic?A wake-up call to EuropeOn 9 September, around 20 Russian drones overshot Ukraine and flew into Poland, forcing the closure of four airports. Nato jets were scrambled and several of the drones were shot down - the rest crashed across Poland, scattering debris in multiple regions.This was a wake-up call to Europe, marking one of the largest and most serious breaches of Nato airspace since the war in Ukraine began.Which is why discussion about a possible drone wall seems ever more pressing.AFP via Getty ImagesOn 9 September, around 20 Russian decoy drones flew into Poland\"This momentum really driven by these recent incursions,\" explains Katja Bego, senior research fellow in the international security programme at Chatham House think tank.Drones - or to give them their official title, Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - have already transformed the battle space.On the killing fields of eastern Ukraine, they tend to be small short-range ones, typically measuring around just 10 inches, and they carry lethal explosive devices. But these are not currently the threat to the rest of Europe. It is the larger drones - some of which can potentially fly well over 1,000km - that are fuelling calls for a European drone wall. Previously Russia imported a type known as Shahed 136 drones from Iran but now it produces its own version: the Geran 2. Some Gerans were among the drones that flew into Poland in September.So, what, some are now asking, if Russia one day sent over 200 drones? Or, say, 2,000? How would Nato respond - and in fact, could it respond?After all, deploying fighter jets each time would be expensive. André Rogaczewski, CEO of Netcompany, a Danish IT services firm that builds digital systems for European governments, argues: \"[It] is neither effective nor a sensible use of taxpayers' money.\"A plague of mysterious dronesUkraine has stepped up its own long-range drone attacks on Russian airports and critical infrastructure like petrochemical plants, bringing the war home to ordinary Russians. Then there are sea drones: uncrewed vessels that can travel either on or below the surface, as used with devastating effect by Ukraine against Russia's Black Sea fleet.But there is something that is in some ways more sinister than clearly identifiable drones used by countries that are openly at war. That is: the plague of mysterious, anonymous drones that have appeared.Sometimes these turn up in the dead of night, around Europe's airports, including one in Belgium's main airport near Brussels earlier this month. There have also been similar sightings in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania.Unlike the clearly identifiable Russian attack drones in Ukraine, these \"civilian drones\" in Western Europe have not – so far – been armed with any explosives. But being anonymously launched, it's hard to prove where they come from or who activated them - or indeed if they are being launched from passing ships. Suspicions fall on Russia with Western intelligence officials believing Moscow is using proxies to launch these short range drones locally to cause havoc and disruption. The Kremlin denies any responsibility.Belgium is one significant target, as the home to Nato headquarters, the European Union and Euroclear (the financial clearing house that handles trillions of dollars of international transactions).AFP via Getty Images'From a European perspective, there is only one country… willing to threaten us and that is Russia,' argued Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in OctoberThere is an ongoing debate around whether Europe should release around €200bn worth of frozen Russian assets, held in Belgium, to help Ukraine. So is it a coincidence that mystery drones have appeared around Brussels and Liege airports, as well as a military base?The UK has sent a team of counter drone specialists from the RAF Regiment, deployed from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, to help bolster Belgium's defences against the drones.Still, the mystery drones are worrying: both because of the danger posed to aircraft as they take off and land but also because of the risk of surveillance, especially around military bases and critical infrastructure such as power plants.Drone wall: why it's not a silver bulletThe plan for a drone wall is Europe's response to the threat of cross-border incursions by drones launched specifically from Russia.The wall has been described as an integrated, coordinated, multi-layered defence system stretching initially from the Baltic states to the Black Sea. It's likely to comprise a combination of radars, sensors, jamming and weapons systems to detect incoming drones - and then to track and destroy them.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be fully operational by the end of 2027.Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesRussia originally imported a type of drone known as Shahed 136 drones from IranNot surprisingly, those countries keenest to see it deployed quickly - including Poland and Finland- are those geographically closest to Russia.Katja Bego believes it is necessary - and long overdue. But she adds:  \"This is not just about drones. There is really not enough in place in terms of more traditional missile defence, air defence, along the Eastern flank borders.\"Nonetheless, a drone wall is not a silver bullet for air defence. And others aren't convinced it's entirely realistic.Robert Tollast, a research fellow at Whitehall think tank The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), argues that the idea of some \"sort of impervious wall\", is, in his words, out of the question. Yet he can still see why there are calls for it and wants to try. Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesPeople in Kyiv and other cities across Ukraine are facing the consequences of attack drones\"For countries that are close to the Russian border – the Baltics, Poland, Germany as well because of course they're within range of those long-range drones - it is absolutely essential to try and build something like this,\" he says.\"The idea here would be not so much to actually build a full-on wall, or something that's fully impenetrable\", agrees Ms Bego. \"It's not really possible - both in terms of the length and also just the available technologies are not 100% foolproof... But rather you're looking at a combination of things that hopefully can capture different types of drones and stop them.\"Stopping drones: Hard kills vs jammingFabian Hinz, a research fellow at The International Institute for Strategic Studies in London describes a whole menu of options to detect drones.\"You can have acoustic detection; airborne radars that can detect low flying targets really well; ground-based radars that have very short ranges against low-flying targets but [that] still work really well against high flying targets.\"You can have optical systems, infrared systems - and once the detection is done you have either soft kill or hard kill.\"Hard kill means destroying the drone, either with gunfire or missiles. Soft kill means making an incoming drone ineffective, usually through electronic means.EPA/ShutterstockPeople look at debris of a Geran-2, among destroyed Russian military equipment on display in KyivRussia and Ukraine have been able to get around soft kills on the battlefield by packing their drones with tens of kilometres worth of fibre-optic cable that spools out as it flies, but that's not an option for something travelling hundreds of kilometres across borders.As for hard kills, Mr Hinz describes many ways of achieving them: from surface-to-air missiles to fighter jets and helicopters. \"You can have lasers which could be useful as well,\" he adds, \"but [these] are not quite the one the wonder weapon people make them out to be.\"André Rogaczewski believes jamming can be effective as an alternative. Ultimately, however, for any drone wall to be effective, it needs to be able to deal with a wide variety of aerial threats, possibly all coming at once.A financially controversial questionAs tensions between Europe and Russia have risen since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, so too have other incidents of so-called \"hybrid\" or \"grey zone\" warfare attributed to Russia, which in most cases denies them.These include cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, incendiary devices inserted into cargo depots, surveillance and sometimes sabotage of undersea cables.And yet at a security forum in Bahrain earlier this month, Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the Italian chairperson of Nato's Military Committee, told me that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priority.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAdm Giuseppe Cavo Dragone sais that of all Nato's defence needs right now, air defence is the top priorityThe first stages of the drone wall are due to be activated within months, though not all details have been finalised.Meanwhile, Nato's Allied Command Transformation (ACT) based in Norfolk, Virginia is working on longer-term solutions. This is not an easy challenge.Mr Tollast says the main challenge of the drone wall is the sheer scale of the area which needs to be protected. \"You need a huge range of tactical radars for low flying drones and larger radars for higher altitude targets, across thousands of kilometres.\"And you need cost effective interceptors and forces to be ready around the clock. It will never be watertight, and even as costs of some radars and interceptors fall, it's very unlikely to be cheap.\"The question of finance is a complex one. \"It is a really difficult defence question,\" says Mr Tollast. \"Even with rising European defence expenditure, there's still going to be a lot of competition from other sectors in defence [for that funding] - we need more ships, submarines, nuclear weapons even, satellites as well.\"So this is why a drone wall will remain this sort of slightly financially controversial issue for some people.\"It will potentially be funded from a mixture of EU money, national budgets (especially in Eastern Europe) and interest from frozen Russian assets.Initially, says Ms Bego, the drone wall referred to defences across the Eastern flank, but since the the EU has been spearheading this, they've been expanding it.\"Everyone recognises something needs to happen and there is a need to co-ordinate this and to mobilise money for this, but the who and what is very much under discussion... \"The more foolproof you would want it to be, the more expensive it gets\".As for the target date, Mr Tollast believes 2027 is very ambitious - but adds, \"they can definitely achieve more protection by then\".Shoot the archer, not the arrowWhile all of this is going on, the task of building the wall is becoming ever harder. Because as fast as new counter-drone measures are introduced, up pops a new form of drone threat that can overcome them.This all makes it something of a new arms race.\"The development cycles for technologies in this space are hyper-accelerated, above all in conflict environments,\" says Josh Burch, co-founder of Gallos Technologies, a UK-based company that invests in security technology.\"It means that any defence against drones will rapidly be rendered outdated as aggressors adjust. \"The aggressor\", he concludes, \"will observe, adjust, repeat – until they get through\".AFP via Getty ImagesMany have died or been wounded in Ukraine from Russian drone and missile strikesSo are we asking the wrong question altogether? Rather than building a drone wall to stop the drones, is it better to target the bases launching the drone themselves - as the old saying goes, shoot the archer, not just the arrow.\"It's one thing to become more resilient against it, but it would be much better if it did not happen at all,\" argues Ms Bego.\"And that's really around making it much clearer to Russia, or whichever actor is behind this, that this kind of behaviour crosses the line. It has consequences and comes with the costs for them. And that's important. It should really be part of this.\"But any suggestion of Nato hitting Russian targets – kinetically, as opposed to digitally in cyberspace – would be incredibly risky and escalatory.Ever since Russia carried out its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 the challenge for Nato, and especially its most powerful member the US, has been to help Ukraine to defend itself but without getting drawn into a Nato-Russia war.Building a defensive drone wall in Europe is one thing. Attacking the places where those drones are launched from is quite another.Top picture credit: Getty Images, SketchfabBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesYou are not going to like all your children's friends and sooner or later, your child will bring home a friend you just don't warm to. Maybe they're rude, overconfident or have a habit of helping themselves to snacks without asking. Or maybe it's deeper than that and you feel they bring out the worst in your child.It's easy to just tell your child they can't hang out with a friend, but that often won't solve the problem.Parenting coach Sue Atkins and mum-of-four and comedian Ria Lina share three ways you can navigate this without driving your own kid away.1. Consider why you don't like themIs it something serious like disrespect, bullying or risky behaviour, or is it just that the child rubs you up the wrong way?Atkins says it's worth doing a little self-audit before reacting as it's important to separate what's annoying from what's harmful.If it's a genuine risk like dangerous behaviour or bullying then it's time to step in more firmly, but if the issue is something like manners, you can model the behaviour you want to see.This is something Lina, whose comedy is often about the trials and tribulations of raising four children, often does. \"When a child is under my care, they follow my standards,\" she explains. \"I tell my children off for putting their feet on bus seats and if other kids under my care are doing that, then I'll tell them to take their feet off too.\"Lina says that the reason you may not like your children's friends is often because of a \"clash of values\" with other parents.\"I've had moments where I thought, this kid makes my kid worse but often it's not really that child's fault.\"For example, I don't allow gun play at home at all, no finger guns or playing with toy guns, but lots of boys do that and that's caused tension when I've told my kids they couldn't join in.\"Sometimes talking to the child's parents can help find a middle ground that both parents are happy with, she says.2. Talk, don't banGetty ImagesIdentify the behaviour you don't like in your child's friend and talk to them about it directlyThe worst thing you can do is just ban your child from seeing a friend as \"you're not helping them engage in better friendships nor are you explaining to them why they can't spend time with that child,\" says Atkins.Being too heavy-handed can \"backfire and your child will probably hang out with that friend more just to spite you.\"You should ask your child why they like that friend - what do they have in common? What do they enjoy doing together?Listening to them share this doesn't mean you approve of their friendship but it helps build trust between you.\"When you talk, choose your moment carefully,\" says Atkins. \"Watch your tone and body language because if you go in aggressive or judgemental, they'll shut down.\"You want to build bridges, not walls.\"Lina says that it's important to tell your child \"you don't approve of a particular behaviour and you don't want to see them copying it,\" she adds. \"That way you're not stopping the friendship or forbidding the interaction but you're drawing a line about what shouldn't be repeated or endorsed.\"3. Widen the circleGetty ImagesJoining a sports group can be a good way for children to meet new people If your child seems stuck in a friendship you're uneasy about, subtly expand their social world.\"Introduce other friends into the mix,\" suggests Atkins. \"Invite cousins over, make them join a sports club or try after-school activities - anything that helps them meet new people.\"It's also important to remember that not every friendship is forever and kids often move through phases, so it's best to see how the friendship changes over a few weeks or months before intervening.\"Sometimes it's just a friend for the summer holidays or it's a teenage kid trying to spite you,\" says Atkins.The best thing you can do is model the kind of friendships you hope your child will form.Talking to them about your own relationships can show your child what respect, kindness and healthy boundaries look like and in turn, they are more likely to mimic that.",

    "body": "11 hours agoCallum MayThe couple said six police officers turned up at the home in JanuaryA couple who were arrested after making complaints about their daughter's primary school, which included comments made on WhatsApp, say police have paid them £20,000 in damages.Rosalind Levine and Maxie Allen told the Times in March they were held for 11 hours on suspicion of harassment, malicious communications and causing a nuisance on school property.Hertfordshire Police previously said the arrests \"were necessary to fully investigate the allegations\".Ms Levine, from Borehamwood, told the BBC police had accepted liability for unlawful arrest and paid damages of £20,000, plus costs. BBC News has asked Hertfordshire Police to comment.Ms Levine added she was \"very pleased\" with the outcome.\"We can now begin to put this whole episode behind us,\" she said.SuppliedThe couple were arrested in January but, two months later, the force said no further action would be takenAccording to the Times, the couple said they were banned from entering Cowley Hill Primary School in Borehamwood after questioning the recruitment process for a head teacher and criticising the leadership in a parents' WhatsApp group.The parents said they emailed the school \"regularly\" following the ban to address issues relating to the needs of their daughter, who has epilepsy, is neurodivergent, and is registered disabled.The school said it sought advice from police after a \"high volume of direct correspondence and public social media posts\" that it said was upsetting for staff, parents and governors.An officer issued a warning to the family in December, telling them to take their daughter out of school, which they did the next month.But a week after that, on 29 January, Mr Allen said six police officers turned up at his home.Mr Allen, who is a Times Radio producer, denied using abusive or threatening language, \"even in private\".The force revealed it was reviewing the investigation, and Police and Crime Commissioner for Hertfordshire Jonathan Ash-Edwards said: \"There has clearly been a fundamental breakdown in relationships between a school and parents that shouldn't have become a police matter.\"GoogleCowley Hill Primary School contacted police after claiming the parents' private and public communications had caused upsetMs Levine said earlier that she still had concerns about \"how and why our arrests were signed off by an inspector\".\"That decision severely impacted both our children. Our three-year-old had to witness her parents being taken away by a swarm of police officers, and my 80-year-old mother became physically ill over it later that day,\" she said.\"I hope that our case will highlight failings within the constabulary and the chief constable will ensure that this never happens again.\"More on this story Related internet links",

I'm not going to hold my breath, but this is a step in the right direction.\"In May, South Western Railway launched its own, separate, \"superfast\" wi-fi rollout for its trains between Earlsfield and Basingstoke, using trackside poles and antennas to create a bespoke 5G rail network.",

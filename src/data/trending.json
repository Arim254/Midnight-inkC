Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US president Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely-used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez earlier ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

There were also times during the pandemic when he was not allowed into the ground.Waites said he still remembered when he got to 1,000 games in 2016 and his friends told him it was \"time to pack in the addiction\".\"A few people at the time threatened to kidnap me for a game,\" Waites said.\"It will come to an end, it's got to come to an end.\"I often wonder how will it end, you know, will we get stuck in a traffic jam somewhere, or a train delay or whatever?\"But yeah, we just roll on.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "29 minutes agoMaia DaviesUK's position on Greenland is 'non-negotiable', says Lisa NandyThe culture secretary has said the UK will not compromise on its position that Greenland's future must be decided by its own people.Lisa Nandy said US President Donald Trump's threats to impose tariffs on the UK and other European allies over the issue is \"deeply unhelpful and counterproductive\", and that an \"adult debate\" with the White House was required.She told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"The future of Greenland is a matter for the people of Greenland and the people of the kingdom of Denmark.\"Nandy said the prime minister had not spoken to Trump since he announced the plan on Saturday, but that he hoped to do so \"at the earliest opportunity\".Sir Keir Starmer has called the move \"completely wrong\" and said his government would be \"pursuing this directly with the US administration\".The White House has in recent weeks intensified calls for a US takeover of the autonomous Danish territory, which Trump says is critical for US security. He has not ruled out taking it by force.The plan would see a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland from 1 February, which could later rise to 25%, until a deal was struck for a US takeover of Greenland.Nandy said Trump will often \"express a very strong view\" before encouraging \"dialogue\".\"He welcomes difference of opinion... and what often happens is a negotiation,\" she said.Asked whether she believed Trump would row back on the tariffs, Nandy said: \"I think this is actually a really serious issue, and I think it deserves a far more adult debate than us threatening the United States, and the United States threatening us.\"\"The one thing that we won't do is compromise on our position\" that Greenland's future was for its people to decide, she added.\"That is non-negotiable. That is the starting point for the conversation.\"She added that Sir Keir may speak to Trump about the matter at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this week.US House Speaker Mike Johnson told Laura Kuenssberg before the tariffs were announced that he accepted Greenland was \"not our land\" but that it had \"strategic importance to us\".\"I don't foresee military intervention\", he said. \"I think diplomatic channels is the way to go\".Trump's announcement has prompted criticism across the UK's political spectrum.Also on the programme on Sunday, Reform UK MP Richard Tice agreed that the move would be \"completely wrong\".\"The objective of protecting Greenland for all Nato allies is correct, the way he is going about it is completely wrong.\"Conservative MP Sir Jeremy Hunt meanwhile told the programme that he did not believe Trump would \"actually follow through\" on taking the territory.\"To invade the sovereign territory of a Nato ally would mean the end of Nato - and that would actually make America weaker,\" he said.\"Because America's strength, a lot of it comes from the fact that it leads the most successful military alliance in history.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch branded the tariffs plan a \"terrible idea\" which would be \"yet another burden for businesses\" across the country.\"The sovereignty of Greenland should only be decided by the people of Greenland,\" she said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said \"Starmer's US policy lies in tatters\" with Trump \"punishing the UK and Nato allies just for doing the right thing\", while the Green Party's parliamentary leader Ellie Chowns called the decision \"unhinged\" and said Trump was trying to \"bully\" countries into compliance.Greenland is a resource-rich Danish territory located between North America and the Arctic, making it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.European countries have rallied to Denmark's support as the White House escalated its rhetoric on its ambition to \"own\" the territory on national security grounds.Announcing the new tariffs in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump said they were playing \"a very dangerous game\" which put the \"Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet\" at risk.Denmark has repeatedly stressed Greenland is not for sale and that an attack on its territory would spell the end of the Nato military alliance, while Greenland has said it would rather remain Danish than become American.",

    "body": "6 days agoHannah MitchellNorth East and CumbriaA \"loveable giant\" dog weighing about 10st (66kg) has found his \"forever home\".Brody, a Pyrenean mountain dog, attracted attention after he was put up for adoption by Animal Concern Cumbria in December.The Egremont-based charity said it received \"hundreds\" of inquiries as well as offers to take in the six-year-old from across Europe and even the US.Lauren Pickthall, animal rehoming manager, said Brody's fame had meant the charity did not need to advertise him and he had settled in with his new family in the south of England.\"It made life easy but also difficult because we had a lot of really solid matches,\" she explained.\"We had people from all over Europe and even America offering him a home.\"His adopters came up to meet him, took him out for a walk and a pub lunch and got to know him.\"Brody stands at about 6ft (1.82m) on his hind legs and can eat more than 2.2lb (1kg) of food per day.The charity previously said that Brody's new owners would need to be experienced with his breed. Pyrenean mountain dogs were bred to be livestock guardians, used to protect flocks from wolves and bears. They have a thick double coat, which requires regular grooming.\"His new home has lots of breed experience, he has a dog friend, land to roam around and they're the loveliest people,\" Pickthall added. \"We've had loads of updates and pictures of him enjoying the snow.\"He was a lovely boy, but we're always glad to see the back of them and get that happy ending - it's what you work for from the minute they come in.\"",

    "body": "4 days agoWedaeli ChibelushiAPP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAcross North Africa, the Amazigh people have been coming together to usher in the year 2976.They have, unfortunately, not cracked time travel. Rather, they are almost a thousand years ahead of much of the world because they follow a calendar that starts at 950 BC, when King Sheshonq ascended the throne of Egypt.The Amazigh new year, known as Yennayer, begins between 12 and 14 January - depending on the area in which they live in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya - so over the last few days families have been laying on huge feasts, lighting bonfires and playing traditional music. Calls of \"aseggas ameggaz\", or happy new year, have been ringing through villages and busy city streets, while vibrant, meticulously embroidered traditional clothing has been donned for the occasion.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAmazigh culture and language has gained greater recognition over the past decadeThe Amazigh (which means \"free people\" or \"noble people\") are a range of ethnic groups that are North Africa's original inhabitants, having occupied the region since the beginning of recorded history.The exact size of the population is not known because of a dearth of official statistics, but according to estimates there are tens of millions of Amazigh people living across North Africa. Algeria and Morocco have the biggest populations - the latter is thought to be 40% Amazigh.Yennayer centres on family gatherings, celebrating renewal and the deep connection the Amazigh people have traditionally had with nature.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThese days Yennayer is marked with parades, concerts and carnivalsBecause the Amazigh are a diverse group, traditional Yennayer food differs from country to country and area to area. In Morocco's High Atlas region, \"ourkemen\", a rich mixture of legumes, spices and whole grains, is a new year's favourite.Many families in Algeria enjoy \"trèze\", a combination of sweets, dried fruit and nuts, after the main meal. The snack mix is sometimes gently thrown over the youngest child in a symbol of prosperity.But Yennayer is not just a family thing. It can also be celebrated with the wider community - parades, concerts and carnivals take the new year's spirit out on to the streets.Such proud displays of Amazigh culture are particularly significant as the community has a long history of being marginalised.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFood, including couscous, is an important aspect of the new year celebrationsIn the 7th Century, as Arab conquerors swept across North Africa, they brought with them their language and the Islamic religion.Both of these were adopted officially, at the expense of Amazigh languages and culture.For instance, during Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule of Libya, the Amazigh language Tamazight was banned in schools and parents were not even allowed to give their children Amazigh names.However, thanks to the dogged campaigning of Amazigh activists, their culture and language has seen greater recognition over the past decade.In 2011, Morocco recognised Tamazight as an official language. Both Algeria and Morocco also declared Yennayer a public holiday, in 2017 and 2023 respectively.So Yennayer marks not just a victory for the Amazigh people, but also a reminder of centuries-long fight that has got the community to where it is now - in 2976.APP/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesYennayer is now a public holiday in Algeria and MoroccoGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Turkey's Zeynep Sonmez said it was more important to be a \"good human being than a good tennis player\" after helping carry a fainting ball girl off court during her Australian Open first-round match.As Sonmez's opponent Ekaterina Alexandrova served for the second set, the ball girl - stood beside the umpire's chair - fell flat on her back before quickly getting back up.Sonmez sprinted over and helped walk her over to the side of the court, where the youngster received medical attention in the shade.The ball girl managed to get back to her feet and was helped off court by medical staff, with play resuming after a six-minute delay.\"She was really struggling. She said she was fine but it was really obvious she was not fine,\" Sonmez told BBC Sport.\"So I went to grab her and said 'sit down and drink something, you're not fine'. \"As we were walking she fainted so luckily I grabbed her. She was really shaking.\"Tennis Australia confirmed that the girl had received medical attention on site before going home.\"I always say it is more important to be a good human being than a good tennis player,\" added world number 112 Sonmez.\"It was just my instinct to help her and I think everyone would do the same. I'm happy I got to help.\"Russia's Alexandrova went on to win the second set before qualifier Sonmez fought back from 3-0 down in the decider to complete a 7-5 4-6 6-4 upset on her fourth match point.\"If I see the ball girl tomorrow or later in the tournament I'd love to speak to her,\" Somnez added.Temperatures reached highs of 28C on Sunday at Melbourne Park as the first major of the year got under way, while the mercury is forecast to reach 35C by next weekend.The Australian Open updated its extreme heat policy (EHP) in 2019 after conducting research into the effects of heat stress on tennis players.This research led to the development of the heat stress scale (HSS), which is used to decide when the conditions get too challenging, and when players' health could be at risk.The HSS, which reaches 5, registered a reading of 2.8 when the ball girl fainted. Advice at that reading is to increase hydration.Ukraine's 20th seed Marta Kostyuk also suffered a surprise defeat on day one as she fell to world number 58 Elsa Jacquemot in a record-setting match.Frenchwoman Jacquemot won 6-7(4-7) 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (10-7) in what was the first triple tie- break match in Melbourne in the Open era.Jacquemot fought back from a set and 5-3 down and saved a match point before securing victory after a gruelling three hours and 31 minutes.It was the longest match of the season so far and was just two minutes shy of 2025's longest match.\"I won it with the heart and with the guts,\" Jacquemot said afterwards.Kostyuk's exit is even more surprising given her strong start to the season, having beaten three top-10 players on her way to the Brisbane International final last week.",

    "body": "57 minutes agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterEPANigel Farage has insisted Reform UK will not become the Conservative Party 2.0 following the defection of former senior Tory Robert Jenrick.Writing in the Telegraph, the party's leader said Reform \"is not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and any potential defectors would have to be prepared to admit publicly that the previous Conservative government \"broke the country\".Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that Jenrick was \"a great new asset\" who brought ministerial experience.However, with around 20 former Conservative MPs joining the party in recent months, critics have argued Reform is becoming a home for failed Tories rather than a new force in British politics.Farage has said his party will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May.\"Any Conservative MP who still clings to the hope that their party can recover and waits until May 8 to try to leave the sinking ship does not understand how rapidly things are changing out in the country,\" he wrote in the Telegraph.\"Trying to use Reform as a lifeboat to save their own political skins will not wash. We have no interest in rescuing political failures.\"He said any defectors would have to bring some benefits to the party and \"truly believe in Reform's fundamental values of family, community and country\".Senior Conservatives believe some other MPs could also defect, although they are not expecting a big wave of departures imminently.Reform has also said a \"well-known Labour figure\" will defect to the party next week.Former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Baroness Kate Hoey, who has sat as a non-affiliated peer since 2020, is among those rumoured to be a possible defector.Asked if she could join Reform, Tice - who was standing in for Farage due to illness - told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme Baroness Hoey was \"a wonderful person\" and \"a good friend\" but refused to confirm whether she would defect.Baroness Hoey has not said whether she plans to defect or not, but told Sky News she had not been a Labour member for more than eight years and is \"not sure I'm that well-known\".Some commentators have suggested senior Tory defectors could prompt power struggles within Reform, with Jenrick touted as a possible shadow chancellor, along with Tice and Reform's head of policy Zia Yusuf.Asked if he would be happy to see Jenrick as shadow chancellor, Tice said the party had \"a great range of talent\" and Farage would \"make his decision about different roles at the appropriate time\".Robert Jenrick is 'a great new asset to Reform' says TiceJenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after he was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet for plotting to defect.As a former immigration, housing and health minister, Jenrick brings government experience to Reform.However, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"Bringing in Robert Jenrick, who presided over soaring NHS waiting lists and the collapse of the criminal justice system in this country, to solve the problems this country faces is like calling out the arsonists to put out the fire.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed her party is stronger and more united since Jenrick left, saying he was not \"a team player\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoDan WhitworthMoney Box reporter, LondonBeth KojderBeth Kojder became pregnant and gave birth to her baby while still waiting for British Gas to provide an accurate final billA woman says it is \"absurd\" it took British Gas 15 months to produce a final bill and refund more than £1,500 of credit, despite the energy ombudsman telling the firm to do so nearly one year ago.Beth Kojder moved out of her one-bed flat in south-east London in October 2024 but complained to the ombudsman a few months later when the company did not send her a final bill or refund her credit.In February 2025 the ombudsman decided in Beth's favour and told British Gas to carry out her request. But it has no legal powers to force it.Beth only received the offer of her money this week, just days before her case was due to be heard in a small claims court.British Gas said it was \"implementing the ombudsman's remedy\" for Beth, adding it was \"very sorry\" for how long it had taken.Beth told the BBC the process had been \"relentless and it's tiring and it's completely draining\".When she moved out of her flat, she asked British Gas for a final bill using the meter readings she provided. She also asked it to refund her £1,700 less a few hundred pounds she expected to owe for her final bill.\"It's a significant amount of money. Maybe not to British Gas but it is to me,\" said Beth, who had her first baby in December. \"That's almost £2,000 I could have done with. Then there's all the admin.\"Not legally enforceableWhen she didn't receive her final bill or refund she complained to British Gas.But Beth said she \"got nowhere\" so took her complaint to the energy ombudsman.It is an independent, impartial dispute resolution scheme that energy customers can complain to eight weeks after first complaining to their supplier.Energy suppliers are legally obliged as part of their licence conditions to be a member of an independent customer dispute scheme. But the energy ombudsman is not a statutory body and it cannot legally force suppliers to act.In 2024, there were 93,000 complaints accepted by the energy ombudsman with around 70% of those cases ruled in favour of consumers, with suppliers required to take action within 28 days.In the vast majority of cases, suppliers met that deadline, but in many thousands of cases the deadline was either missed or no action was taken at all.It has prompted the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ)to look at ways to strengthen the energy ombudsman saying the number of decisions not being implemented quickly enough was too high.Beth KojderBeth's energy bill was for her small, one-bed flat in south east LondonIn Beth's case the ombudsman issued four resolutions in February 2025. British Gas actioned three minor ones including a written apology and a goodwill credit of £100 for shortfalls in service.But the decision also required British Gas to \"complete the final billing of the account... based on the [meter] readings already provided by Beth.\" But 11 months on and that still hadn't happened.Beth said the only option she had left was to go down a legal route via a small claims court.\"I just felt completely desperate and like it was the only option to try to get some traction,\" she said.Beth KojderBeth said it was frustrating how much intervention she, as a consumer, had to do to resolve the matterBBC Radio 4's Money Box first contacted British Gas about this case in early December and, up until late Thursday night, Beth was resigned to having to go to the small claims court to get what she strongly feels she's owed.Then, British Gas came back with an offer of everything Beth was asking for, which she has happily accepted.Beth said she was pleased to get the matter resolved but said she was frustrated that it had taken so many months to do so and felt British Gas had \"completely failed\" to engage with the ombudsman process.\"I still think the fact it's taken this long to reach [a resolution] is absurd. And the level of intervention that's been required on my part as a consumer is unbelievable.\"British Gas said: \"We're implementing the Ombudsman's remedy and, together with Ms Kojder, are finalising a resolution to her claim. We appreciate this has been difficult for her and we're very sorry for the length of time it has taken to put things right.\"Ofgem's deputy director of retail compliance, Jackie Gehrmann, told the BBC that in the last year suppliers have paid out £27m in fines and voluntary payment agreements in consumer related issues.\"The message to suppliers is really, really clear. When the ombudsman makes a ruling they should implement that ruling as quickly as possible,\" she said.The DESNZ told the BBC: \"We are strengthening the Energy Ombudsman so consumers can be confident that when it has ruled in their favour, action will be taken.\"",

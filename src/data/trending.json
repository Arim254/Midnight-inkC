There was no future at Roker Park. It was difficult for people to comprehend because of the emotion attached to it, but I knew it.</p><p>\"We only turned over about £4m and were losing money. Although Roker had a capacity of about 22,500, we only sold out that season against Manchester United and Newcastle. There was no training ground.</p><p>\"The club was finished as an operation.

Some 36 models have been cleared for discounts of at least £1,500.</p><p>Ian Plummer, Autotrader's chief commercial officer, said the grant scheme had given a \"real lift to the market\".</p><p>\"Since July, enquiries for new electric vehicles on Autotrader are up by almost 50%. For models eligible for the grant, interest has more than doubled.\"</p></div>",

An alternative definition is any full Moon within 360,000km of the centre of the Earth - and under this interpretation October's Harvest Moon would not qualify.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"What-is-a-Harvest-Moon\"><span>What is a Harvest Moon?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>Full Moons throughout the year are given <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/weather/videos/cr527z00r76o\">names</a>, often dating back centuries, that reflect what is happening in nature.  </p><p>October's full Moon is known as the Hunter's Moon but it is also this year's Harvest Moon.  The Harvest Moon is the name given to the full Moon that rises closest to the autumn <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/cwynx6xy3gyo\">equinox</a>, traditionally a time for gathering crops. It also rises around sunset for several evenings in succession creating extra light for farmers working outside.</p><p>The equinox this year was on 22 September, and often the Harvest Moon occurs  in the same month.

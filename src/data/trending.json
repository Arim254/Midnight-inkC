    "body": "<div><p>A Canadian amusement park is threatening to euthanise 30 beluga whales after the government blocked its request to send them to China.</p><p>Marineland in Ontario had hoped to offload the cetaceans on a theme park in Zhuhai, after suffering years of animal welfare concerns and financial woes.</p><p>But their transfer was denied by the Canadian government last week over concerns they would face similarly substandard treatment as \"public entertainment\".</p><p>The park then asked for federal funding to be able to continue caring for the animals - but this was denied, being branded \"inappropriate\" by Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson.</p></div><div><p>In the absence of funding as it winds down operations, Marineland has now said it may have to put the belugas to sleep, according to the New York Times and CBC News.</p><p>It reportedly said this was \"a direct consequence of the minister's decision\".</p><p>The park is said to have told ministers that it was in a \"critical financial state\" and unable to provide adequate care for the whales, having being closed over the summer while it removed the animals still there.</p><p>But Thompson said Marineland's lack of a viable alternative home for the belugas did not entail the Canadian government should foot the bill for their care.</p><p>Marineland had hoped to send the belugas to Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in Zhuhai, which sits in between Hong Kong and Macau in China.</p><p>Thompson denied its export permit, saying the strengthening of fisheries legislation in 2019 that made it illegal to use whales and dolphins for entertainment prohibited the move.</p><p>\"I could not in good conscience approve an export that would perpetuate the treatment these belugas have endured,\" she said.</p><p>\"To approve the request would have meant a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment.\"</p><p>Criticisms of Marineland date back several years, and in 2020 Animal Welfare Services opened an investigation into the park.</p><p>It found that 12 whales at the park had died over a two year period and declared all the park's marine life to be under distress. </p><p>Some 20 whales have died at the marine park since 2019 - five of them in 2024 - according to news agency the Canadian Press.</p><p>As visitors to the park began to plummet and Marineland became mired in financial crisis, it won an appeal in February to remortgage its own land to funds moving its animals while it looked for a new buyer.</p></div><div><p>Animal welfare campaigners have expressed outrage at Marineland's conduct and the possibility the whales could be killed.</p><p>Camille Labchuk, executive director of Canadian animal rights group Animal Justice, said Marineland had \"a moral obligation to fund the future care of these animal\", adding that threats to euthanise the animals were \"reprehensible\".</p><p>World Animal Protection called on the provincial government to seize the belugas, saying it \"must show leadership and ensure these animals receive the best possible care\".</p></div>",

I'm going to be winning.\"</p></div>",

The government no longer publishes official data on the numbers of deaths of homeless people.</p><p>Among those who died was Anthony Marks, 51, who was assaulted in August 2024 near London's King's Cross station while sheltering in a bin shed.</p><p>Two weeks after being released from hospital, he was readmitted following a seizure and died. Four people have been charged over his death. </p><p>\"We shouldn't be surprised that people are dying on our streets,\" said Tim Renshaw, chief executive of the Archer Project, a homeless charity in Sheffield.</p><p>\"We have one of the worst systems in terms of making housing available to the poorest. We are looking at homelessness being related to health factors - trauma, depression, anxiety. And we've increasing levels of poverty.\"</p><p>In November 2024, three homeless women died within 10 days in Sheffield.</p><p>One of those, a woman in her 40s, was buried without a single person attending her funeral.</p><p>She'd been known to homeless services in Sheffield for a number of years, said Mr Renshaw, but the name they knew her by was not her registered name.</p><p>When her funeral was arranged in her official name, no-one recognised her. </p><p>\"It was an absolute tragedy,\" he said. \"We had people approaching us saying they'd liked to have attended her funeral.\"</p></div><div><p>Of the 1,611 people who died homeless in 2024, three quarters were men. Two-thirds of the deaths were of people living in temporary or supported accommodation, while 169 were rough sleeping. Eleven were children, though the Ministry said the true figure was likely to be higher.</p><p>The figures show that 1,142 deaths were in England, an increase of 16% on the year before.  </p><p>London had the highest total number of deaths, but the largest increases were in Nottingham, where the number of deaths doubled to 22, and in Exeter, where they more than doubled from eight to 21.</p><p>In Northern Ireland, deaths increased by more than a third between 2023 and 2024, to 211. Wales saw a small annual decrease, from 97 to 90.</p><p>In Scotland there was an 18% reduction overall from 206 to 168. The Museum of Homelessness found that deaths in both Glasgow and Edinburgh fell by around 40%.</p><p>The figures are compiled by the Museum's Dying Homeless Project.  It says its methodology does not include any estimates and that it is the only organisation collating the figures since the Office for National Statistics stopped doing so in 2022.</p><p>The deaths come as the number of people living in temporary accommodation across the UK is at record levels, while the number of people rough sleeping in England rose 20% in 2024 to 4,667, according to official statistics.</p></div><p></p><h2>Child deaths 'cannot be tolerated'</h2><p></p><div><p>Experts working with homeless people say they have yet to see any real policy differences since Labour took office.</p><p>They welcome Labour's commitment to building 180,000 homes for social rent over the next decade, but they say consistent multi-year funding to tackle the issue is so far lacking.</p><p>\"[Former housing secretary] Angela Rayner and [former homelessness minister] Rushanara Ali leaving their posts in 2025 lays bare the lack of leadership on homelessness and housing at all levels of government in the face of the worst homelessness crisis this country has ever seen,\" said Mr Turtle.</p><p>Homelessness Minister Alison McGovern said that government was \"expanding access to safe accommodation whilst also strengthening support services.</p><p>\"Every loss of a life, especially the death of a child is an abject failure that cannot be tolerated,\" she added.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c169/live/0b883bd0-a389-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Family photo Richard Sanders wearing a black T-shirt.

The BBC has reached out to DPD for further comment.</p><p>It had been thought that the delivery service could face disruption after some of its drivers began three days of action.</p><p>DPD previously said it did not expect the stoppage to have a \"significant impact\" on its services, and added that it had increased pay rates for the delivery of larger parcels.</p></div><div><p>Some drivers had refused to work for three days after DPD said it would cut the amount it pays for deliveries of small parcels by 65p.</p><p>The lower rate was intended to apply to those who are self-employed or franchised, which is the majority of DPD drivers.</p><p>The BBC has been told that the various chat groups where drivers were organising their action had about 1,300 to 1,500 participants.</p><p>Several drivers told the BBC they were given only a few hours notice before the payment changes came into effect in late September.</p><p>DPD said it had \"adjusted some of our rates to reflect changes in our parcel traffic profile\".</p><p>It said driver stops which include only smaller parcels would see a reduction of 65p.</p><p>Stops which include larger parcels, or high-value or pharmaceutical parcels would see no change, DPD said, while heavier deliveries would get an extra 65p.</p><p>The company also said it had introduced new incentive payments, \"designed to increase earnings all year round\".</p><p>\"As a result, we believe our driver remuneration package remains among the best in our industry,\" it said.</p><p>But one driver said the changes would cut his income by about £25 a day, or around £6,500 a year, which would make it \"difficult\" for him to manage his household costs.</p><p>Another driver said that even with the increased rate for larger parcels, there is \"no way\" he could make up the losses resulting from the 65p cut.</p><p>\"We just don't get that many larger parcels to make up for the loss resulting from the rate cut in smaller parcels,\" he told the BBC.</p><p>\"And even if we did take on more larger parcels, we would have to work longer and do more stops just to earn the same amount as before the cut.\"</p><p>The drivers taking part in the action said they would refuse to deliver parcels on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week.</p><p>DPD previously said: \"We acknowledge that some drivers have raised concerns regarding the new arrangements, and these are being addressed.</p><p>\"However, a small number of drivers at various depots have chosen not to operate today. We do not expect this to have a significant impact on our service.\"</p></div><div><p>The move comes as the delivery sector suffers from increasing competition as people shop more online and get shopping delivered to their doorstops.</p><p>Online communication has already caused its first casualty among traditional postal services: Denmark <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v37plv2edo\">recently ended its letter deliveries service</a>, PostNord.</p></div>",

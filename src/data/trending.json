    "body": "Andrew Rosindell has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Reform UK.The former shadow minister and MP for Romford said the Tories were \"irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments\" and not willing to take \"meaningful accountability\" for poor decisions. He said he had spoken to Nigel Farage on Sunday evening before agreeing to join his party. The Reform UK leader called him \"a great patriot\" who \"will be a great addition to our team\".A Conservative source said Rosindell's departure was a prime example of Farage doing the \"spring cleaning\" of Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, and Reform was \"welcome\" to him.Rosindell's move comes after Robert Jenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after being sacked from the shadow cabinet by Badenoch, who had accused him of plotting to defect.The 59-year-old, who was a shadow foreign minister before his resignation, said in a statement on X that the \"views and concerns of constituents such as mine in Romford have been consistently ignored for far too long\".\"Our country has endured a generation of managed decline,\" he added. \"Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain.\"Rosindell becomes Reform's seventh MP and the third sitting Conservative MP to join the party, following Danny Kruger and Jenrick.This week's defections mean that - putting aside independent MPs, who do not vote in a block - Reform UK now has the joint fifth biggest party grouping in the Commons, alongside Sinn Fein which does not send any of its seven MPs to Westminster. It is two MPs behind the fourth biggest party, the SNP.About 20 former Tory MPs have switched their allegiance to Reform UK, including former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who did so a week ago.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Jenrick said it was \"great news\" Rosindell had joined Reform adding: \"If there are other members of Parliament who are in the same situation, then I'm sure Nigel [Farage] and the party would welcome them in.\"But he has said very clearly, that you need to make up your mind quickly because Reform is growing fast.\"Shadow Welsh Secretary Mims Davies told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that Conservative MPs defecting to Reform were \"self-serving and completely wrong\".\"I do find this very confusing that these people who are saying they want to put things right, want to be right-wing, but ultimately there's a lot in Reform which is very left-wing and obviously populist,\" she said.\"I really don't think that arguing that Britain is failing helps people. People want to know, yes things are wrong but the people they've elected are willing to roll up their sleeves and get themselves up to what needs to be fixing rather than looking self-serving.\"Rosindell has held the Romford seat in east London since 2001, although his majority was cut from 17,893 to just 1,463 at the last general election.After switching to Reform, he cited the Labour government's decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and the \"failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition to actively hold the government to account on the issue\" as among the reasons for his defection.Negotiations to transfer sovereignty of the islands began under the Conservatives in late 2022. However, under Kemi Badenoch, the Tories have criticised the handover deal struck by the Starmer government last year.Speaking to reporters on Monday, Rosindell described the Chagos handover as \"one of the reasons\" for his defection, whilst also saying his old party was \"not radical enough\" to offer answers to challenges facing Britain. Also speaking to reporters, Farage insisted his party would not become a \"lifeboat\" for Conservative MPs, or \"Tory Party 2.0\".The Reform leader has said his party would not accept further defections after elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, and a series of local elections in England, due on 7 May.A Conservative source said Rosindell had been \"threatening to defect for months, denying it was happening as recently as Saturday\". They added: \"We're not going to be distracted from holding this disastrous Labour government to account.\"The Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The stench of a failed and dying Tory Party now engulfs Reform.\"Nigel Farage is now unconditionally trying to rehabilitate their disastrous record,\" she added. \"The public won't be fooled: the Tories failed Britain and Reform want to do it all over again.\"A Liberal Democrat source said the defection was \"a change of rosette for a career politician worried about getting a P45\", adding: \"The public are fed up hearing about how Britain is broken from the very same people who broke it.\"Jenrick told a news conference where he announced his defection to Reform that the Tories \"broke\" the country and had \"betrayed its voters\", with the UK now \"in decline\". He later told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that the country needed a \"new and exciting\" leader \"who hasn't been part of that failed consensus\".Badenoch called it a \"good day\" for the Conservatives and said Jenrick was \"now Nigel Farage's problem\".She wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was destined to fail as it welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" she said.Correction - an earlier, breaking news version of this story incorrectly stated that Rosindell was the seventh Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK. He is actually the third sitting Conservative to switch allegiance, and takes the number of Reform UK MPs to seven.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryGUARDIA CIVIL HANDOUT/EPAAt least 39 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, the country's Civil Guard has said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is expected to visit the scene later on Monday, where rescue efforts are ongoing.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?What caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. He suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Are people still trapped in the trains?There were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Alvia, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of midday on Monday, 112 people had received medical assistance, 43 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 43 victims still in hospital:Four are underage, including one who is in intensive careTwelve adults are also in intensive careWhat have the survivors said?Passengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told public broadcaster Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoNick EdserBusiness reporterGold and silver prices hit record highs but share prices fell on Monday as investors reacted to the threat by US President Donald Trump to impose fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.The price of gold touched $4,689.39 (£3,499) an ounce on Monday, while silver rose to a peak of $94.08 an ounce.Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.But stock markets in Europe fell as investors worried over the latest increase in geopolitical tensions. On Saturday, Trump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal on Greenland was reached.Reports have suggested the EU is considering responding with a €93bn (£80bn) package of tariffs on US imports.Worries over the Greenland spat triggered another rise in gold and silver prices as investors headed for \"safe haven\" assets.Last year, the price of gold soared by more than 60%, partly due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.\"Gold has hit fresh record highs on its glittering run upwards,\" said Susannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club.\"The precious metal is holding even more allure as a safe haven as worries spread about the repercussions of the US aggressive trade and geopolitical policies.\"But while gold and silver were continuing their recent strong runs, shares were on the back foot.London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.6%, while the FTSE 250 - which has a greater number of domestically focused companies - was down 1.1%. A mixture of financial firms and industrial stocks were lower, but shares in gold miners Fresnillo and Endeavour rose following the latest increase in precious metal prices.Across Europe shares in carmakers, tech and luxury goods firms saw sharp falls.In Germany, the Dax index fell 1.5% with car companies BMW, Mercedes-Benz and VW all down by about 3-4%.In France, the Cac 40 index was down 1.6%, with luxury brands LVMH and Hermes among the biggest losers.However, European defence stocks rose, with Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales both trading higher.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at AJ Bell, said Trump's latest tariff threat \"turns up the heat to max\".However, he noted that \"while we've seen a red day for European shares in general, it's not panic time\".\"What needs to be watched closely is how markets behave over the near term. A 1% to 1.5% decline every day over a series of weeks adds up to trouble, and that's what investors are keen to avoid happening.\"Markets in the US are closed on Monday for a public holiday.",

    "body": "China's birth rates sunk to a record low in 2025, despite the government rolling out a spate of incentives to boost it, as the country's population fell for the fourth straight year.Government data on Monday showed that the country's birth rate fell to 5.63 per 1,000 people – a record low since the Communist Party took power in 1949 – while its death rate rose to 8.04 per 1,000 people, the highest since 1968.Its population fell 3.39 million to reach 1.4 billion by the end of 2025, marking a quicker decline than the previous year.Faced with an ageing population and sluggish economy, Beijing has been trying hard to encourage more young people to marry and have children.In 2016, it scrapped its longstanding one-child policy and replaced it with a two-child limit. When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow up to three children per couple in 2021.More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a new 13% tax on contraceptives - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by other factors - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.",

She said she was initially shocked by the diagnosis in 2023, because the condition was so rare.\"But I was kind of relieved that I had support, I was happy that someone actually believed me,\" she added.However, Amber's symptoms have not improved with medication.She also develops hives and a rash when coming out of water, whether from a swimming pool, the shower, or the sea, regardless of the outside temperature.PA MediaMedication has not helped Amber's symptoms and she continues to struggle to manage the conditionAmber said she often arrived at work and school with redness and hives, and has had to turn down plans with friends.\"When I go out, I always have a reaction - I walk about 20 minutes to the bus stop and I get a reaction,\" she said.\"My friends are always out, and they're always inviting me out, and I can't really go out because of it, so I feel left out.\"We have to plan around where we go. If it's somewhere inside or at someone's house that's fine, but if it's outside, then I can't do it.\"But Amber remains hopeful about the future.\"I'm hoping there's going to be a lot more research going into this and hopefully there's more medication out there for me.\"I just want to be able to go about my everyday things that other people can do.\"More top stories",

    "body": "Faisal Islam: Global disruption looms large over biggest-ever Davos13 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editor, Davos, SwitzerlandEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockTrump appeared at Davos remotely last year, a few days after his inaugurationApart from the snow and the temperature, Greenland does not have much in common with the Swiss alps. But the fight for the future of the island looms over the gathering of world leaders and businesses at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week.Indeed, the timing of Donald Trump's extraordinary threat seems likely to have had this meeting in mind.Trump loves Davos - which is beyond strange given the views of his base.Last year, he beamed himself into the WEF from the White House, appearing before an audience of largely bewildered European executives just two days after his inauguration.There was awkward shuffling as he mentioned his territorial ambitions for Canada and Greenland, and made an \"offer you can't refuse\" to those importing into his country. Build factories in the US or pay tariffs that will raise trillions: \"Your prerogative.\"He did it with a smile, however, apologised for not attending in person and promised he would be there this year.And on Wednesday he will be here, pushing the Team USA message at a time of bewilderment in much of the rest of the world, especially in Europe.Trump is due to speak at what will be the biggest Davos ever, driven by his presence and his policies, which have caused what one of the cerebral sessions of WEF might refer to using a snappy title like \"The Great Global Disruption\".Trump is the disruptor-in-chief, certainly right now. He will be pursued by other world leaders and corporate bosses about his attempt to coerce Europe economically to sell Greenland. The forum will be the centre of the world this week - and totally bizarre.\"A spirit of dialogue\" is the official theme, and while there are certainly opportunities at an event like this for conversations not possible elsewhere, there is much in the US administration's approach that seems to be opposed to the call for global cooperation that is the essence of this place.ReutersDavos, nestled in the Swiss Alps, is not friendly home territory for the US presidentAfter all, Davos is not a great brand on planet Make America Great Again (MAGA). The conference in the Swiss Alps is more often the brunt of attacks like that from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who once claimed his state was the place where the \"Davos agenda is dead on arrival\" and promised he would resist its \"woke banks\" and \"lab-grown meat\".This year, there have been suggestions that the White House insisted on the forum playing down its typical green, global development and \"woke\" agendas in favour of hard-nosed business issues. Meanwhile, America's biggest companies have been shaken down to create a \"USA House\" in a church for delegates to celebrate the World Cup and the 250th anniversary of US independence.Given the global arguments over borders and sovereign power from Greenland to Caracas to the Donbas, and the world leaders present, it is not impossible to envisage some sort of summit like Yalta - the 1945 meeting that gathered the leaders of the US, UK and Russia to plot the defeat of Germany - on the sidelines.Most of the G7 leaders will be coming, as will Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, along with 65 other heads of state and government, 850 of the world's top bosses, and dozens more tech pioneers.Trump himself will be arriving in the Swiss alps with five cabinet members, a massive entourage of administration officials, and the US business elite, from Nvidia's Jensen Huang to Microsoft's Satya Nadella.But this is not friendly home territory for the US president. His determination to obtain or even invade Greenland will not go down well with a European audience.Instead, it will be Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney who will represent the vision of North America that Europe would love to will into existence.Carney has ridden out the best part of a year of US trade chaos with a growing economy, having replaced the US with other trade partners and was recently spotted proclaiming a new world order protecting multilateralism with Xi Jinping in China.The Chinese themselves will be present at finance minister level, offering up their country - the world's second largest economy and now largest car exporter - as the world's grown-ups.It is a place where every year they seem to tap their watches and wait for their slow economic, technological and geopolitical ascent.After all, let's not forget the lessons of last year's Davos, where the US triumphalism on display at the start of the week had been utterly superseded by the end with news about a strange Chinese AI chatbot called DeepSeek.It was at Davos a decade ago that I was first told about a quantum computer.Then, last year at a session on car batteries I came away convinced that US and European car manufacturers had no chance of catching the Chinese technology this decade.Many people rail against Davos. But it will be worth tuning in: the future can be found in some of its most brightly branded corners.",

    "body": "Picture the scene. An emotional Kyren Wilson is cutting a dejected and disconsolate figure in the dark and grey bowels of the York Barbican. Not only has he had family health issues to contend with, but a difficult campaign has been compounded by being forced to change the cue that he used to win the world title in 2024 - after it was damaged in a \"freak accident\". The Englishman even says he was close to having a \"mental breakdown\" during his last-32 defeat by Elliot Slessor at the UK Championship - just last month.The future looked forlorn. Then fast forward just six weeks to images of Wilson pouring out of Alexandra Palace on Sunday, as he lifted the Paul Hunter Trophy and celebrated his maiden Masters triumph with his family. \"It's amazing. Father Christmas was very kind to me,\" said Wilson, who auctioned off his beloved old cue for a children's cancer charity, raising £5,250.\"It was a complete freak accident, what happened to my cue, so there are no bad feelings there but it is so important to have something you can trust out there.\"Armed with a suitable replacement, Wilson, 34, made it third time lucky when he became the 26th winner of the Masters, having twice previously been defeated in the final. His route to glory and a second Triple Crown title took him past Si Jiahui, Neil Robertson, Wu Yize and finally four-time world champion John Higgins, who is widely regarded as one of the game's greatest players. \"I'll be honest I thought at the UK Championship I was gone, I honestly didn't know if I was ever going to be back in the winners' enclosure,\" Wilson added.\"I have such a supportive family and I promised my mum she was going to have that bit of crystal [Masters trophy] on her dining room table.\"People don't see what happens behind closed doors but I was in a bad way at the UK - really, really suffering.\"To pick up a new cue and, after one month, to go and win the second biggest major is an incredible achievement.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoLucy HookerBBC News reporterGetty ImagesThere is a reason it is called Blue Monday. Slap-bang in the middle of a month that is all about freezing drizzle and self-denial, the third Monday in January is notoriously the gloomiest day of the year.But some of us are fighting back.Here are some ways to find joy among the January gloom.1. Have a laughLaughter is a great tonic. Making other people laugh is even better.Ask Paddy Merritt. The 24-year-old had a go at stand-up comedy last year and is now hooked.His legs were shaking the first time, he says. But the third gig was \"amazing\".\"People were laughing really hard.\"\"Feeling you are bringing other people joy is a wonderful thing.\"Even if you are nervous, it can be a kind of exposure therapy, he says, going in at the deep end socially. If it goes badly you can still feel proud you tried.Paddy MerrittPaddy branched out into musical comedy after building an audience for his songs online2. Be interestedSophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, has dabbled in stand-up herself. As she told What's Up Docs on BBC Radio 4, a huge range of things can bring joy but it is almost always to be found in the company of others.So if you don't want to go up on stage, watch comedy instead, or just hang out with friends, anything where there's a chance you'll have one of those \"laughing 'til your face hurts\" moments, she suggests.Joy is often quite intense, she says. There is a sense of being \"overwhelmed with the emotion\" in contrast to other forms of happiness, such as comfort or contentment.But don't panic if joy doesn't happen right on cue, says Sophie. If you want birds to come to your garden you don't march around it shouting \"come on birds\", she points out. You make the garden beautiful and wait.\"Let yourself be enthusiastic about things. Let yourself be interested in things and interested in people,\" she says.3. Dinner with friendsAna CassAna meets her friends at the sauna for the double benefit of the warmth and the chatAna Cass says seeing other people is definitely a source of joy for her. The 27-year-old data scientist struggles with seasonal affective disorder, meaning January can be tough, but she has found ways to counter it.\"What has helped the most is having dinner with friends.\"We take turns hosting. We hang out. We chat. That's the best thing I've done all winter.\"At the weekend, instead of cafes, she and her friends often choose to meet at the sauna and plunge pool, with the added buzz that offers.\"That rush makes you forget that January is miserable and cold.\"4. Move - skip, dance or walkThere is often a physical aspect to joy, says Sophie Scott.\"Almost all expressions of joy involve jumping, running, movement.\"There's even the phrase \"jumping for joy\".Poet David Larbi reckons even a tiny moment of joy can put a spring in his step. \"Today, the sun was out, and I left early. \"I was listening to the right music - Stevie Wonder,\" he says.\"So I had a little skip.\"Dancing and listening to music you love are both great ways to give yourself an \"endorphin bump,\" says Scott. Even a short walk will leave you feeling a bit better, she says.David LarbiDavid Larbi says joy doesn't have to be about big eventsAna recommends salsa classes, something she has been doing for a decade, as another thing that brings her joy.Dancing, she says, allows the kind of casual social interactions that are no longer as common in our work-from-home, shop-online environment, and a physical closeness.\"When you dance close, you touch. That human aspect feels good.\"Getty Images5. Enjoy your socksYou don't have to wait for salsa night, points out David Larbi.\"On the average day, you can have a little smile at four or five things that might seem minute, but bring you a happy feeling,\" he says.\"And the good thing about doing that is, the more of those small moments you notice, the happier you are, and the more likely you are to notice them.\"He shares his upbeat philosophy on social media, and has published a book, Frequently Happy, encouraging people to look for uplifting moments in the everyday.\"This morning, it was very cold, and I put my socks on. My feet were a little bit warmer.\"That moment of joy made me feel a lot better.\"And if sometimes in the middle of January, it feels as though winter is out to get you, with its biting winds and long nights, he says, remember, it is nothing personal.\"Winter is not actively malicious,\" he says. \"It is just the earth doing what it has to do.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "12 hours agoFergus WalshMedical editorBBCDr Giovanna Lalli, from LifeArc, says her team are looking at the presence of three proteins in the blood that have been linked to Alzheimer'sAn international trial is examining whether a finger-prick blood test could be used to help diagnose Alzheimer's disease.The study, involving 1,000 volunteers aged over 60 in the UK, US and Canada, will aim to detect biomarkers associated with the condition.Dr Michael Sandberg, a London GP, was encouraged to take part in the study after witnessing his mother's slow decline from Alzheimer's disease. He had a negative result from the tests and said it was \"a huge relief\".The Bio-Hermes-002 study is led by the medical research charity LifeArc and the Global Alzheimer's Platform Foundation, with support from the UK Dementia Research Institute.Dr Giovanna Lalli, director of strategy and operations at LifeArc, said: \"We are looking at the presence of three proteins that have been linked to Alzheimer's disease, so-called blood-based biomarkers.\"By analysing the concentration and the levels of these proteins it may tell us whether a person is at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\"Studies have shown that rogue proteins called amyloid and tau can accumulate in the brains of individuals over 15 years before they start to display symptoms of Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.The finger-prick test could be done at home in the futureAll the volunteers will have the current gold-standard tests for Alzheimer's which involve a specialised brain PET scan using a radioactive tracer, or a lumbar puncture to remove a sample of cerebrospinal fluid.Such tests are expensive, time-consuming and invasive and only two in 100 Alzheimer's patients are offered them, so the hope is that the finger-prick test could help revolutionise how the disease is identified.Prof Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at the Alzheimer's Society, said, with tests not currently widely available across the UK, \"getting an accurate diagnosis takes far too long\".She added: \"With new treatments on the horizon, early and accurate diagnosis must be a priority for the NHS. That's why we're funding work to bring blood tests for dementia to the NHS, so everyone who would benefit from a diagnosis can get one quickly and accurately.\"Dr Michael Sandberg, whose mother had Alzheimer's disease, took part in the trial Trial participant Sandberg told the BBC: \"My mother did very well on a trial and that encouraged me to take part.\"I believe knowledge is power and am really excited that you may be able to screen people at risk of dementia without expensive scans or needles.\"When Sandberg was given his results, both the brain scan and the finger-prick test were negative.  He said: \"It's a huge relief, knowing what my mother went through\".This is - of course - just one set of results.  Scientists will need to analyse the findings from all 1,000 volunteers on the trial before they know how useful the finger-prick blood test is at spotting the risk of Alzheimer's.Dr Emer MacSweeney, a neuro-radiologist at ReCognition Health, is recruiting some of the UK volunteers.She said: \"If this is successful, it provides a ubiquitous, accurate test which can detect the presence of abnormal amyloid protein in the brain without complicated, expensive investigations.\"Using biomarkers in the blood to identify Alzheimer's risk is a rapidly developing field of research.Last year US regulators approved a blood test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. That involves a traditional blood draw using a needle and syringe.Another study is under way in the UK looking at whether using blood tests improves both the diagnosis and treatment in real-world settings.A key advantage of the finger-prick test would be that it could be carried out by individuals at home, and the sample be posted to a lab for analysis, as it does not require refrigeration.There are hopes that blood tests could eventually be used as a screening tool for dementia for older adults.To date, the study has enrolled 883 of the 1,000 participants with more than 360 completing all the tests.This includes a mix of cognitively normal and mildly impaired people and some with early-stage Alzheimer's.At least 25% of volunteers will be from under-represented groups. The trial is expected to complete in 2028.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAnna FosterPresenter, Today programmeUN Photo / Alba García RuizAntonio Guterres told the BBC some believe \"the power of law should be replaced by the law of power\"The US is acting with impunity and believes its power matters more than international law, the head of the UN has told the BBC.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, António Guterres said Washington's \"clear conviction\" was that multilateral solutions were irrelevant.What mattered, he continued, was the \"exercise of the power and influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".His comments come weeks after the US struck Venezuela and seized its president - and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland.Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat.President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations.He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had \"ended seven unendable wars\" on his own and the UN \"did not even try to help in any of them\".\"Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us,\" he said.Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter.The UN was \"extremely engaged\" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. \"But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage.He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted.Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members.\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said.\"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".He suggested the UN Security Council - designed to maintain international peace and security - no longer represented the world and was \"ineffective\".Any one of the council's permanent members - France, China, Russia, the UK or US - can currently veto resolutions. Both Russia and the US have used this power to frustrate global efforts to end the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.Guterres claimed vetoes were being used to further individual members' interests, and criticised the fact that \"three European countries\" were permanent members.He called for changes to the council's composition - to \"regain legitimacy\" and \"give voice to the whole world\" - and to limit veto powers to avoid unacceptable \"blockages\".ReutersGuterres, whose term as secretary general is coming to an end, met Sir Keir Starmer in London last FridayGuterres – a former Portuguese prime minister – took on the job of heading the UN in 2017, and will leave the role at the end of this year.In his annual remarks to the General Assembly, traditionally used to identify the organisation's priorities, he warned of a world in chaos, \"brimming with conflict, impunity, inequality and unpredictability\", and identified \"brazen violations of international law\" as one of the biggest challenges facing the global order.One of the ongoing conflicts Guterres identified as key for the UN was Gaza.For large parts of the war it was prevented from distributing aid in the strip, as Israel blocked international humanitarian organisations from bringing it into the territory.At one point, Israel even backed an external contractor – the Gaza Humanitarian Organisation – to do the work the UN had traditionally carried out for decades. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites.When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: \"Of course, but let's be clear.\"For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza. And then there was a ceasefire, and a massive flow of humanitarian aid.\"He stressed: \"We were ready, provided we had the conditions.\"A few days ago, Guterres told the UN General Assembly that \"1945 problem-solving\" wouldn't solve 2026 problems, referring to the organisation's founding structure.The challenges keep coming, with the US-forced change of leadership in Venezuela, regime forces in Iran killing thousands of protestors and Donald Trump's stated aim of annexing Greenland.Questions about the death of multilateralism - and the failure of some world leaders to speak out and defend the rule of international law - are growing ever-louder.But Antonio Guterres told me he was remaining positive.\"I think that people are sometimes reluctant to confront the powerful. But the truth is that if we don't confront the powerful, we will never be able to have a better world.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

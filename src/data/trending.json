    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul KirbyReutersThe suspect was detained by police after he set fire to his carA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Oléron, off the west coast of France, injuring five people - including two who are in a critical condition.A local man in his mid-30s deliberately drove into people and was arrested after being immobilised with a stun gun, authorities said. The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people including a young girl, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron Thibault Brechkoff said.He eventually abandoned his vehicle and set fire to it before running away, Brechkoff said. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, said the suspect was known to police and that he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest. Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who travelled to the scene, said an inquiry had been opened into the incident and that the prosecutor would decide whether to pass on the case to anti-terrorism authorities.He said that one of the badly injured victims was a 22-year-old woman who suffered multiple traumas.The 35-year-old suspect is being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder.A popular holiday destination, the Ile d'Oléron is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) and lasted 25 minutes, Nuñez said. According to local reports said a gas canister was found in the back of the suspect's car after he set the vehicle alight. Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.",

President Donald Trump has responded to Mamdani’s victory by writing on social media that the government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot were the reasons why the Democrats won.\nBut with Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill also winning their governors races in Virginia and New Jersey, there is a renewed sense of hope within the party that this could mark a turning point after the 2024 presidential election.\nJustin, Sarah and Marianna assess whether the Democrats will be able to capitalise on their success, and how the Republican Party might respond.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Alix Pickles.

    "body": "4 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterUS actress and director Kristen Stewart has said she is \"so angry\" that progress for female film-makers in Hollywood has gone backwards after a post-MeToo boost.The Twilight star, who directed forthcoming film The Chronology of Water, delivered an impassioned speech at a women's luncheon in Los Angeles hosted by the organisation behind the Oscars.\"The backsliding from a brief moment of progress is statistically devastating,\" she told the audience. \"Such a pitiful number of films from the past year have been made by women.\"The Celluloid Ceiling, an annual report that monitors the number of female film-makers, said 11 of the top 100 grossing films of 2024 were directed by women, down from 16 in 2020.The MeToo movement of 2017 led to a reckoning in Hollywood about men in power and female representation both in front of and behind the camera.The following year, 2018, saw only four of the top 100 films directed by women, but that number had risen to 16 by 2020, following the MeToo movement's momentum. No figures are yet available for 2025.During her speech, Stewart said: \"In a post-MeToo moment, it seemed possible that stories made by and for women were finally getting their due. That we might be allowed or even encouraged to express ourselves and our shared experiences, all of our experiences without filter.\"But I can now attest to the bare-knuckle brawling that it takes every step of the way when the content is too dark, too taboo, when the frankness with which it serves up observations about experiences routinely experienced by women, frequently provokes disgust and rejection.\"She added: \"We can discuss wage gaps and taxes on tampons and measure [inequality] in lots of quantifiable ways. But the violence of silencing, it's like we're not even supposed to be angry. But I can eat this podium with a fork and [expletive] knife. I'm so angry.\"The guests listening to Stewart's speech included Sarah Paulson, Julia Louis Dreyfuss, Tessa Thompson, Riley Keough, Zoe Deutch, Claire Foy and Kate Hudson.Stewart received several rounds of applause over the course of her seven-minute speech, according to Hollywood trade publication Variety, which was also present.\"I am thankful to you,\" she said. \"I am not grateful to a boys' club business model that pretends to want to hang out with us while siphoning our resources and belittling our true perspectives. Let's try and not be tokenised. Let's start printing our own currency.\"New films from Chloé Zhao, Kathryn Bigelow and Mona Fastvold are among those in the running in the forthcoming Oscars race, but the best director category is once again expected to be male in majority.",

    "body": "Wrexham footballer James McClean says he punched a Cardiff City fan in self-defence after being confronted before a match.McClean, who plays as a winger, said a group of rival fans \"started running their mouths off\" at him as he was getting out of his car in the players' car park.Wrexham AFC said the incident happened before the two clubs faced each other in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup at The Racecourse on 28 October.McClean told Talksport: \"I'm in my workplace and I feel I should never feel threatened in that workplace... I wasn't waiting for him to make the first swing. So I did.\"He said: \"Somehow, there were four male Cardiff fans - late 20s, early 30s. \"They recognised me [and] immediately started running their mouths off at me. I ignored the first jibe. \"The second, I responded to and I confronted them about it.\"Words were said. One of them, a tall chap with glasses, made a hostile move towards me.\"McClean added: \"People need to understand just because we play football doesn't mean people can try to take liberties without their actions having consequences.\"That was it. Nothing further happened. And the situation was dealt with.\"The game, which kicked off at 20:00 GMT, saw Cardiff City win 2-1 to secure a spot in the quarter-final against Chelsea at home on 16 December.Wrexham said the incident was \"reported to the relevant authorities\" and declined to provide any further comment.Cardiff City FC said it has not received a formal complaint \"from any supporter\", adding it has not been approached by Wrexham or North Wales Police.North Wales Police said it has not received any reports relating to the incident.The Northern Ireland-born player was the subject of verbal abuse earlier this year, when Lincoln City fans aimed anti-Catholic chants at him during a match on 3 May.The club was fined £8,500 by the Football Association for failing to control supporters.McClean, 36, grew up in Londonderry and has previously said he learned how to make petrol bombs at 11 years old because of the riots.He has refused to wear a poppy because of Bloody Sunday - when 13 people were shot dead when members of the British Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in 1972.He has 103 caps for the Republic of Ireland, scoring 11 goals for the national team between 2012 and 2023.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Amy WalkerA migrant who returned to the UK by small boat less than a month after being removed to France under the \"one-in, one out\" scheme has been removed again.Home Office sources said a returns flight on Wednesday morning included the man who was removed on 19 September, before he returned to the UK on 18 October.The Iranian man claimed to have been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the man's case had been expedited after he was detected by biometrics and detained. She added: \"Anyone looking to return to the UK after being removed under the UK-France agreement is wasting their time and money.\"My message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. I will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.\"The man, who has not been named, previously told the Guardian he returned to the UK because he feared for his life in France.Speaking about his alleged treatment at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"So far, 94 migrants have been removed from the UK as part of the treaty in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection and have not attempted to cross the Channel illegally.Under the scheme, 57 people have come to the UK from France.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch previously said the case showed the government was \"in total chaos\", adding in an X post that it was \"too weak to take the tough decisions to secure our borders\".Maddie Harris, director of Humans for Rights Network, previously told BBC News her organisation had been in contact with the Iranian man.She said he was experiencing \"acute fear\" after his first removal from the UK due to his treatment by smugglers.\"While in France he experienced horrendous treatment at the hands of the people who are organising journeys to the UK,\" she said.The government has been under pressure to tackle the issue of illegal migration, amid a rise in arrivals during 2025.As of 21 October, 36,734 people had arrived in the UK by small boat this year,The figure was 8,530 more than on the same date in 2024, but 869 lower than at the same point in 2022, which was the highest year on record.Along with the UK-France treaty, the government has also pledged to end the use of asylum hotels, which have cost billions of pounds and become a focal point for recent anti-migrant protests.Under the previous Conservative government, plans for the UK to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were passed by parliament but faced numerous legal challenges.Four people were sent there before the scheme was ended by the current Labour government.",

    "body": "16 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorThe 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".The King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.  Those honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's chief AI scientist Dr Yann LeCun.They are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently chief AI scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.  There is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.  She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised. She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.She says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.This ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person. The three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be. Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.Prof Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "40 minutes agoDaniela Relph,Royal correspondent, Rio de Janeiro and Hafsa KhalilThe Prince of Wales has followed in his mother's footsteps with a visit to the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro.Prince William stood in the same spot that Diana, Princess of Wales, was photographed in 34 years ago.He is on the third day of his five-day visit to Brazil, where he will be presenting the Earthshot Prize, the annual award from the charity he set up.The star-studded event will be held in Rio's Museum of Tomorrow on Wednesday evening, where Kylie Minogue and Shawn Mendes will perform as five projects win £1m.The prince is also scheduled to give a speech at COP30, the UN's annual climate meeting.On a picture perfect day, the future king stood alone in a moment of reflection as he took in the views of Rio de Janeiro from the top of Mount Corcovado where Christ the Redeemer stands.The iconic and imposing statue is one of the largest Art Deco sculptures in the world, standing at 30 metres tall and reaching 28 metres wide with its outstretched arms.It has become a symbol of hope and resilience and is said to protect the people of Rio. Princess Diana posed in the same spot in April 1991 during her six-day tour of Brazil with the now King Charles III.During Prince William's walkabouts in Rio, dozens of people spoke to him about his late mother, who died in August 1997. \"The prince has loved meeting so many people from across Rio over the last few days,\" said a spokesperson for the prince. \"He's been incredibly struck by the number of people who fondly remember his mother's visit to this beautiful city.\"At Christ the Redeemer, Prince William also had some time away from the cameras in the chapel that sits beneath the statue.Security has been high throughout his trip.Public access to the statue was temporarily suspended to allow him to visit the site and meet the 15 Earthshot Prize finalists ahead of the evening's awards ceremony.The shortlist this year includes the city of Guangzhou in China and its electric public transport network, Lagos Fashion Week in Nigeria, nominated for its work reshaping the fashion industry, and Barbados for its environmental leadership.The prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories to projects that aim to repair the world's climate.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will join the prince for the ceremony before they both head to Belem in the Amazon rainforest for COP30, where world leaders will discuss how to limit and pepare for further climate change.Prince William's first day in Brazil involved football in the Maracana Stadium and barefoot beach volleyball on Copacabana.On Tuesday, focus shifted to the environment - his reason for visiting the country.The prince criticised criminals for their involvment in the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during a speech at the United for Wildlife conference.He also travelled to the small island of Paqueta, where he met locals, learnt about mangrove conservation and planted tree saplings.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe Duke of Sussex says \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are among the things that he loves about Britain and which he thinks define British culture.Although he lives in California in the US, Prince Harry says \"Britain is, and always will be, the country I proudly served and fought for\".He shared his thoughts in an essay published ahead of Remembrance events, with the prince set to visit military veterans in Canada this week. Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan, called on people not to forget the contributions of veterans who might need help \"once the uniform comes off\".The essay, which does not reference the scandal surrounding his uncle Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, looks at: \"What it means to be British.\"He writes: \"The banter of the mess, the clubhouse, the pub, the stands - ridiculous as it sounds, these are the things that make us British. I make no apology for it. I love it.\"Prince Harry also writes about drawing inspiration from Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian invasion.\"There is a similar stoic spirit of self-deprecation and humour in Ukrainians, that I recognise more than any other, in us Brits,\" he says.Prince Harry, who runs the Invictus Games for injured service men and women, urged people to remember \"those who still carry the weight of war in body and mind, and the families who bear its memory in their hearts\".This week will see annual Remembrance events, including the ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Sunday.\"Remembrance has never been about glorifying war. It's about recognising its cost: the lives changed forever and the lessons paid for, through unimaginable sacrifice,\" writes Prince Harry.\"It's also about honouring those who, knowing that cost, still choose to serve.\"The essay has appeared as his brother Prince William is in Brazil for his Earthshot environmental awards.Prince Harry, who moved to the US more than five years ago, recently talked on a podcast about his experience of US culture.The host Hasan Minhaj asked him: \"What's the most American thing you do now?\" to which Harry replied:  \"Surf.\"But Harry said he had not adopted other traits, such as drinking Coors Light beer or wearing shorts in a restaurant.In the podcast Prince Harry also warned about the dangers of social media for young people.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond Chia,Business reporter and Paul Kirby,Europe digital editorDIMITAR DILKOFF/POOL/AFPWhile the BHV department store celebrated the opening of Shein, there were protests outsideThe French government says it is initiating proceedings to suspend the online platform of Asian online giant Shein, after prosecutors said they were investigating the company over childlike sex dolls found on its website.The economy ministry said under the prime minister's order proceedings would last for \"as long as necessary for the platform to prove to authorities that all of its content is finally in compliance with our laws and regulations\".The government's move was announced little more than an hour after Shein opened its first physical store in the world, on the sixth floor of Paris department store BHV.Shoppers queued to get into the store, while protesters screamed \"Shame!\" at them.Shein has promised to co-operate fully with Paris prosecutors who are also investigating three other platforms - Temu, AliExpress and Wish. Allegations  surrounding the sale of childlike sex dolls on Shein first came to light from France's anti-fraud office at the weekend.BHV's decision to house the fast-fashion giant has angered rival clothing brands and a number have said they will leave the prestigious department store in protest.Protests against the opening continued inside the store, and one person let off a foul-smelling spray.NurPhoto via Getty ImagesProtesters held up placards outside the BHV store and shouted \"Shame!\" at shoppersShein has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions.Fashion designer Agnès B said earlier she would close her concession in BHV when her contract ended in January. \"I'm completely against this fast-fashion... there are jobs under threat, it's very bad,\" she told French radio. Shein spokesman Quentin Ruffat earlier promised to provide information on sellers, buyers and products involved in selling the childlike sex dolls on its site.AliExpress told the BBC it took the matter very seriously. Temu said it was not involved in the case and did not allow the sale of such items on its platform, although it told the BBC it was working with French authorities \"to reinforce our minor protection mechanism\". Wish has also been contacted for comment.Frédéric Merlin, whose SGM company runs BHV, has admitted that he considered ending the department store's partnership with the retailer.However, he said Shein's response had \"convinced me to continue\" and he expressed confidence in the products it was going to sell in his store. \"The clothes we're going to sell do not exploit workers or children,\" he told French radio.Shein, which was founded in China, is also set to open outlets in seven other cities, inside Galeries Lafayette department stores run by SGM. But Galeries Lafayette has refused to have anything to do with Shein and will withdraw its name from the stores in Angers, Dijon, Grenoble, Le Mans, Limoges, Orléans and Reims.The Paris prosecutor's office said Shein and the other three e-commerce platforms were being investigated over violent, pornographic or \"undignified messages\" that could be accessed by minors.Shein and AliExpress are also under investigation over the dissemination of content related to children that are of a pornographic nature, the prosecutor's office said.The cases have been referred to the Paris Office des Mineurs, the prosecution service added. The office is an arm of the French police force that oversees the protection of minors.AliExpress said the listings in question violated its policies and were removed once it became aware of them.\"Sellers found to violate or trying to circumvent these requirements will be penalised in accordance with our rules,\" AliExpress said in a statement.On Monday, Shein said it had banned the sale of all sex dolls on its platform worldwide. The Singapore-based retailer also said that it would permanently block all seller accounts related to the illegal sale of the childlike dolls and set stricter controls on its platform.The French consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said the sex dolls' description and categorisation left \"little doubt as to the child pornography nature\" of the products.",

There are 75 others missing and 17 injured, officials said on Wednesday.Videos show people sheltering on rooftops, while cars and shipping containers have been swept through the streets.The official death toll, which is likely to rise, includes six crew members of a military helicopter that crashed on Mindanao island, south of Cebu, after it was deployed to assist in relief efforts.The aircraft went down on Tuesday near Agusan del Sur and was one of four sent to help.\"Communication with the helicopter was lost, which immediately prompted the launch of a search and rescue operation,\" the Philippine Air Force said. Later, a spokeswoman said six bodies had been recovered, believed to be of the pilot and crew.The typhoon, locally named Tino, has weakened since making landfall early on Tuesday, but has continued to bring winds of more than 80mph (130km/h).It is forecast to move across the Visayas islands region and out over the South China Sea by Wednesday.But residents across Cebu province are still reeling from the deadly floods.

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Verstappen is aiming to equal Michael Schumacher's record of winning five consecutive F1 drivers' championshipsByF1 Correspondent in AustinFor the first time all year, Max Verstappen said after the United States Grand Prix that winning the world championship was a real possibility.It felt like a significant moment, because until now Verstappen has been dismissing the idea.That made sense during McLaren's imperious form from the beginning of the year to the end of the summer.Even when Verstappen started winning races in September, the points gap to the McLaren drivers was so big that the four-time champion refused to entertain the idea in public, even if he might have been thinking about it in private. He was taking it race by race, he said, and not thinking about the championship.Verstappen said the same thing at the start of the weekend in Austin, even though he had won two of the past three grands prix and finished second in the other. A McLaren had not finished ahead of him since the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August.After a race weekend in which Verstappen took pole and victory in both the sprint and grand prix itself, he could have said it again. He might even have been expected to. But the belief in him now was almost palpable.\"For sure, the chance is there,\" Verstappen said. \"We just need to try and deliver these kind of weekends to the end. We will try. It is exciting.\"Of course we know we need to be perfect to the end of the season to have a chance, but we will try, and if we succeed, of course amazing.\"If we don't, we tried everything we could to the end and we kept it exciting. That's the spirit for us. It's positive pressure. It's not putting anything on us. We're not stressed about it. We're just going flat out.\"Verstappen's remarkable runThe statistics of the last four races over the past month and a half are quite remarkable.After the Dutch Grand Prix, Verstappen was 104 points behind McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the championship, and 70 adrift of Lando Norris. Now, he is 40 points behind the Australian, whose lead over his team-mate has been cut to just 14 points.Verstappen expressed his own incredulity at what he had achieved. If someone had told him after Zandvoort this would happen, he said, \"I would have told him he was an idiot.\"But we found a good way with the car. It's simple as that. Of course, we put some upgrades on the car, but we just understood our car a bit better, where we wanted it to perform better.\"A 64-point gain in four races tells its own story, but how it has come about is just as remarkable.McLaren trounced Red Bull through the summer races in Europe - until the Italian Grand Prix in early September, when an upgraded floor and front wing finally gave Verstappen the balance he had been craving all year.Since then, the Red Bull has been the fastest car. Until this weekend in Austin, that could have been explained away through circuit characteristics - Monza, Baku and Singapore are all short, slow corners, and require good braking and traction.The McLaren's strengths are not in this area - they are in long-duration, medium-speed corners, where they crush everyone else.But Austin is a \"normal\" circuit, a road course not a street circuit, not a high-speed outlier like Monza, with a good range of corners. And Verstappen won again.There are five races left, two of them sprint events. If he keeps closing on the McLaren drivers at the rate he has been, he will win a fifth consecutive title, it's as stark and simple as that.Norris 'had the pace to win'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc battled all race over second positionThere are circuits to come that play to McLaren's strengths - Brazil, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, the team have singled out.But Verstappen's recent form brings everything into question.On Saturday in Austin, McLaren team principal Andrea Stella was saying that the Verstappen-Red Bull combination could be the fastest at every remaining track this year.By Sunday, though, Stella's tone in public had become more positive. He was encouraged, he said, by the fact that Norris \"had the pace to win the race today\".This, Stella said, had been proved on the few laps Norris was able to run his pace. Verstappen agreed.\"As soon as Lando was in clean air,\" the Dutchman said, \"it was very evenly matched or he was slightly faster. We managed to gap to the end but it was not super-easy.\"Norris' problem was that he spent the vast majority of the race stuck behind Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.Ferrari were the only team to pick the right strategy. Leclerc started on soft tyres, which gave him the grip off the line to pass Norris into the first corner.Most teams started on the mediums, expecting the race to be a one-stop on the medium and hard tyres. But it soon became apparent in the first stint that the cars who had started on hards were struggling.Leclerc held Norris back for the entire first stint. He pitted first, fitting the medium tyres, while the McLaren driver stayed out on his mediums. When Norris finally pitted, fitting the softs instead of the hards that had been the plan at the start of the race, he emerged behind Leclerc again, inevitably.He expected to be able to pass relatively easily, but although he caught the Ferrari quickly, Leclerc fended him off again. Norris backed off to cool his tyres and had another go, and it was not until five laps from the end that he was finally able to claim second place.Had he held on to it at the start, the race could have been very different. \"Performance-wise,\" Stella said, \"we are reassured that the pace was sufficient to fight for the victory.\"This was especially encouraging because the crash between the McLaren drivers that had taken them both out of the sprint on the first lap had cost them valuable learning.That meant McLaren had had to be conservative with their set-up, especially in terms of ride height, because they lacked the necessary data on a track where other teams have in the past been caught out by the bumps and been disqualified for excessive floor wear.McLaren had to err on the side of caution, and it inevitably cost them performance. Hence the encouragement from the fact that, despite that compromise, they were nevertheless competitive in the race.Piastri denies pressure getting to himImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oscar Piastri won seven of the first 13 races this seasonAs Verstappen closes on both McLaren drivers, so Norris has been closing on Piastri - he was 34 points behind his team-mate after Zandvoort; he has now reduced that by more than half.Piastri finished behind Norris in Monza, had a very poor weekend in Baku, and lost out in Singapore when Norris barged past him at the first corner.This weekend was different. He lacked pace from the off, never comfortable with the car, always lagging about 0.2secs behind his team-mate.\"I don't think there's an overwhelming trend that things are in a bad way,\" Piastri said. \"It's just that this weekend has been has been tough. So we'll try and understand why that was the case. And try and bounce back next week.\"He denied that the pressure was getting to him.\"No, I don't think so,\" Piastri said. \"The pressure has been there the whole year.  This weekend, I didn't really feel like I made any mistakes. It just wasn't very fast.\"There's some weekends where it just doesn't click for you. And this was one of those. When you feel like you've done a reasonable job and just the pace hasn't been there, I don't think that's really what pressure looks like.\"I've been in fights that were as close or at this point even closer than what they are now. So I've got the evidence for myself that things can still turn out well and I still fully believe that I can win the championship.\"There's still a long way to go in the championship. Max has obviously chased it down pretty quick, but it's not exactly a small gap with five rounds to go.\"Ultimately, if we can find our way again, find our pace, certainly for me find our pace again, then I don't have any major concerns.\"'Results will take care of themselves'Norris, Piastri and McLaren as a whole are heading into new territory.The drivers and the team have not fought for a drivers' title before, although Norris threatened Verstappen last year. The only exception is Stella, who is the veteran of many close battles, when he was race engineer for Michael Schumacher, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso at Ferrari.His job now is to keep the team and drivers on an even keel, to try to brush off the pressure and focus on the job in hand.\"We keep talking about the fact that what we are facing in this moment - which is a tight competition to win races, a tight competition in the quest for the drivers' championship - is what Formula 1 is about,\" Stella said.\"If anything, it was anomalous when we were doing easily P1, P2, like in Barcelona, in Bahrain, and some other places. That's not what Formula 1 is about.\"It's a process of getting used to this kind of pressure, which we want to live with maximum intensity and minimum stress.\"We don't want to lose the joy of doing what we do. We just want to make sure that we put ourselves in the state in which we perform at our best, which also includes having fun and keeping recognising that ultimately it's quite a big privilege to be in this situation.\"And it's a privilege that came thanks to the good work that McLaren, the team, the two drivers, have been able to do.\"So what we do in the future is very easy. We keep doing the good work and the results will take care of themselves.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondent andHarry SekulichBritish soldiers will be granted new powers to shoot down drones threatening military bases.The plans, to be unveiled by Defence Secretary John Healey in a speech on Monday, are intended to allow troops to take faster, more decisive action.Four British airbases used by US forces reported mystery drone sightings last year, while drones have disrupted airspace across Europe a number of times in recent months.The new powers will only apply to military sites, but could be extended to civilian locations such as airports.Healey is set to announce the introduction of a \"kinetic option\", first reported by the Daily Telegraph, that would enable British troops or Ministry of Defence (MoD) police to shoot drones posing a threat to a military site in the UK.Existing protocol mandates soldiers divert drones or disrupt their GPS signal using counter-drone equipment. Shooting down an unidentified drone is only allowed in extreme circumstances.RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall, in Suffolk, RAF Feltwell in Norfolk and RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire all reported drone incursions in November last year.About 60 RAF personnel were sent to assist the US Air Force in its investigation.Neither US nor UK officials have said who might have been behind the drone activity. The airbases have strategic significance for the US military. It recently deployed F-22A fighter jets to RAF Lakenheath, days after the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites in June.Recent drone sightings across the European Union prompted a leaders' summit in Denmark earlier this month.Several EU member states have backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, track and destroy Russian drones.Twenty Russian drones crossed into Poland in September while Russian MiG-31 jets entered Estonian airspace later in the month. Russia has denied or downplayed the incursions.Other recent drones sightings have also forced numerous European airports to close, including across two consecutive days in Munich, Germany.Airports in Denmark and Norway also shut after unidentified drones were spotted near airport and military airspaces.Russia denied any involvement, while Danish authorities said there was no evidence Moscow was involved.

    "body": "2 hours agoJohn SudworthKyiv andMaia DaviesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would be ready to join Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin at a proposed summit in Hungary if he were invited.The US and Russian presidents announced on Thursday they planned to hold talks on the war in Ukraine in Budapest, possibly in the coming weeks.In comments released on Monday, Zelensky told reporters: \"If it is an invitation in a format where we meet as three or, as it's called, shuttle diplomacy… then in one format or another, we will agree.\"Meanwhile, media reports have suggested his White House meeting with Trump on Friday descended into a \"shouting match\" - with the US side urging Ukraine to accept Russia's terms to end the war.Zelensky was guarded during his first press briefing since the talks, but still his comments made clear there were large areas of disagreement between the two sides.He described the meeting as frank, and said he had told Trump that his main aim was a just peace, not a quick peace.He criticised Hungary as the location of the prospective Trump-Putin talks, saying the country's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could not do \"anything positive for Ukrainians or even provide a balanced contribution\".When asked by reporters on Friday if Zelensky would be involved in the meeting in Budapest, Trump said he wanted to \"make it comfortable for everybody\".\"We'll be involved in threes, but it may be separated,\" he said, adding the three leaders \"have to get together\".Zelensky had hoped to secure US Tomahawk missiles to strike deep into Russia at the talks, but appeared to walk away empty-handed as Trump struck a non-committal tone on the matter.On Monday, media reports suggested the atmosphere at the US and Ukrainian leaders' meeting had been far more acrimonious than previously understood.The Financial Times reported Trump warned Zelensky that Putin would \"destroy\" Ukraine if he did not agree to its terms, citing sources familiar.The US side was said to have echoed Russian talking points at the \"volatile\" meeting. It also reported that Trump tossed aside maps of the frontline in Ukraine and insisted Zelensky surrender the entire Donbas region to Putin.Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Just last month, Trump appeared to take a major shift in his position on ending the war by saying Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\".He said his position had changed \"after getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia military and economic situation\".Trump had previously warned the process would likely involve Ukraine giving up some territory - an outcome Zelensky has consistently rejected.The US president has been pressuring Nato nations, as well as China and India, to stop purchasing Russian oil in a bid to create further economic pressure on Moscow to end the conflict.He also previously threatened Russia with tougher sanctions if Putin did not meet deadlines to make progress in ending the war, though he did not follow through with those threats.Trump's public relations with Zelensky had also vastly improved in recent months, most notably from an Oval Office meeting in February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president on live television.During his re-election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to office.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGill DummiganNorth WestBBCFreya Mandapalli, 19, is among many medical students who are choosing to study abroad A growing number of young people are choosing to study in Eastern Europe due to a strict cap on medical school places in the UK.Freya Mandapalli from Preston is one of them.The 19-year-old has healthcare in her blood.  Her parents both work at the local hospital and her older sister studied medicine at Edinburgh and now works as a doctor.\"I just got inspired by her really,\" Freya said.But getting into a medical school in the UK generally requires a minimum of three As at A-level and high grades in other subjects and Freya struggled to get them.Although she got interviews, she didn't receive any offers.  She considered a gap year but then a family friend mentioned the possibility of studying in Plovdiv, in Southern Bulgaria.\"I was really nervous to start with, but the city's beautiful and I've found some great friends,\" added Freya, who has just started her second year of a medical degree.In England around 8,126 medical students started this academic year, just over a thousand of them in the North West.  This is sharply up from two years ago when it was just 7,010 but still far short of the 15,000 the government says it needs for England by 2031 to meet demand.But with the cap on medical school places, it means competition to get one is intense, and many students are voting with their feet.'Word of mouth'Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton has just started his fifth year at the same university in Plovdiv.  He too found the course through word of mouth.\"One of my friends told me that his brother already studies within Bulgaria and he was planning on going himself,\" he said.\"My mother was very worried, my father wanted me to stay strong and be independent, but the rest of my family didn't know what to expect.  But those worries gradually subsided.\"The Medical University of Plovdiv is one of Bulgaria's most prestigious medical schools and attracts many more applicants than it admits.  Although it does ask for academic qualifications, a large part of the admissions process hangs on an entrance exam.Mohammed Adnaan Patel from Bolton is now in his fifth year at the university in PlovdivProfessor Veselina Goranova, vice rector for Education, says their students' home countries include Greece, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Canada, the US – but added the biggest group by far, \"about 40% come from the UK\".That may be in part because classes for international students are held in English but also because a well-established network of agencies now exist to help those hoping to make the leap.Dr Muhammad Hamza from Blackburn graduated from Plovdiv last year and is currently back there helping to settle new students. He works with MedConnect Europe Ltd, an agency headquartered in London but with offices around Eastern Europe.He says the agency helps new students navigate the complications of a new life abroad like finding a flat, dealing with paperwork, and sorting out life's essentials.\"We get them in touch with the estate agents, we book the flights for them. Our representatives will be there at the airport to collect them, take them to the hotels,\" he said.Medical students, including Freya, are studying in Bulgaria instead of the UKStrict timetable\"We help them with shopping – buying bedding, cutlery..wifi, mobile sims, setting them up.  Because they don't know the language and we have representatives in each country which do know the language it becomes so much easier,\" he added.Dr Hamza spends most of his time working as a private dentist in Chorley, where he spends a year with a mentor. The firm, he says, came out to Plovdiv to recruit dentists there.\"It's probably because of the vast practical experience we get in Bulgaria,\" he said, adding that the Bulgarian system requires students to complete large numbers of relatively complex procedures.\"So going and starting as a dentist in the UK, I already had somewhat of a solid foundation.\"New students need to get used to a strict timetable which often begins at 7.30am and may not finish until 6pm.  They also need to study Bulgarian so they can talk to the patients they will be treating in the last three years of their course.Dr Hamza now works as a Dentist in Chorley after studying in BulgariaBulgarian, like Russian, uses the Cyrillic alphabet, and a complex grammar structure.  Milena Muleshkova is one of those tasked with getting the students up to scratch. She says that first year is about everyday communication, while the second-year concentrates on medical terms.Medical courses in Bulgaria last six years,  one year longer than in the UK but common in mainland Europe.  At the end of it, successful students have a degree which is recognised by the General Medical Council in England, and which allows them to practice in the NHS without any further tests.Watch BBC World Service documentary : Why are medical students going to Bulgaria?This may change though in 2028 when Britain next looks at its agreements with the EU.  And another potential change is particularly worrying some students.The NHS has become increasingly reliant on attracting healthcare staff from overseas to meet increasing patient demand. In 2023 68% of doctors joining the NHS were international medical graduates (IMGs) and the number has been rising year on year.There is uncertainty around the future of qualifications medical students gain from studying in BulgariaCurrently the NHS treats applicants from overseas and the UK in the same way for jobs and training opportunities.  This has become an increasingly contentious issue for resident (formerly known as junior) doctors in England who say many at the beginning of their career are being denied the opportunity to progress.Earlier this month they voted to strike over the shortage of speciality training places.But the doctors' union the British Medical Association wants UK graduates to be prioritised for those training posts.  Health Secretary Wes Streeting says he agrees.  But this could mean British students studying abroad would also be looked at less favourably because they would also be classed as IMGs.'It's quite scary'Mohammed Adnaan Patel said he did have sympathy with much of the argument but not all.He said: \"It's quite a topic of frequent discussion as the years go on as we get closer to that stage,\"\"It is quite scary.  It does raise a lot of anxiety within the students and myself.\"But the NHS also has difficulty keeping hold of medical staff.  Last year in the North West of England one in ten left  - although that was actually better than the year before.  Some will have left the profession altogether but some will have been tempted away by similar jobs in Canada, Australia, and the gulf states, who also run international recruitment campaigns.As the global population ages and healthcare needs increase, the international fight to attract trained medical staff, wherever they come from, is likely to intensify.Dr Muhammad Hamza from MedConnect Europe says he doesn't see the demand for European students slowing any time soon.He said: \"I see it growing because the demand for doctors and dentists, not only in the UK is a lot but all over the world\"\"I don't see it slowing down.  It's going to expand further and further.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoMartin YipHong Kong andStuart LauWatch: Wreckage of cargo plane seen at Hong Kong International AirportTwo Hong Kong airport security staff were killed when a cargo plane skidded off a runway, hit their patrol vehicle and ploughed into the sea.Emirates flight EK9788 was arriving from Dubai at about 03:50 local time (19:50 GMT) when it veered off the runway, crashed through perimeter fencing and collided with the security vehicle, pushing it into the water.The two people inside died. The Boeing 747 ended up partly submerged, but the four crew on board survived. Officials are investigating the cause of the crash on the north runway. Two other runways remain operational. It's one of the deadliest aviation incidents in years at Hong Kong International Airport, which has a good safety record.The investigation will focus on the unanswered questions over the path taken by the plane upon landing.Airport officials have said they gave the correct instructions to the plane and that there are signs on the runway to guide aircraft.Airport operations executive director Steven Yiu said the patrol car was, at the time, travelling on a road outside of the runway's fencing \"at a safe distance from the runway\". The plane then turned away from the runway, crashed through the fencing and collided with the vehicle, pushing it into the sea, Mr Yiu explained.\"Normally the plane is not supposed to turn towards the sea,\" he said at a news conference hours after the incident, adding that the plane did not send out a distress signal when it was landing.He stressed that the airport patrol car \"definitely did not run out onto the runway\".The weather, runway conditions, the aircraft and its crew will all be looked at as part of the investigation, Mr Yiu said.Divers managed to locate the bodies of the patrol vehicle’s driver and passenger in the sea.The two dead ground staff were aged 30 and 41 and had seven and 12 years' experience respectively, officials said. Neither was breathing when recovered from their vehicle, which was five metres (16.4 feet) from the shore, and seven metres under water. The younger of the two was confirmed dead at the scene, and the other later in hospital.  Hong Kong's transport bureau has said it was \"saddened\" by their deaths and expressed condolences to their families.In a statement to the BBC, an Emirates spokesperson said the plane \"sustained damage on landing in Hong Kong\", adding: \"Crew are confirmed to be safe and there was no cargo onboard.\"It also said the Boeing 747-481 cargo aircraft was wet leased from, and operated by, Turkish carrier Act Airlines. A wet lease is an arrangement where one airline provides the aircraft, crew and insurance to another airline.The four crew members onboard the plane had opened the emergency doors of the aircraft shortly after the crash. They were spotted by fire service staff who arrived at the scene within two minutes, and were rescued, authorities said.Pictures show the plane had broken in half, with part of the fuselage submerged in the water with large cracks clearly visible. At least one emergency evacuation slide deployed successfully.ReutersPart of the plane's fuselage is lying in the water off the runwayA police official told the media that criminal investigations would not be ruled out.An official from the Hong Kong Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) said they were still trying to locate the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - also known as the black boxes - from the sea.The affected runway would remain closed for the rest of the day, but the airport's other two runways are still in operation.At least 11 cargo flights initially scheduled to arrive at Hong Kong International Airport on Monday have been cancelled, according to the Airport Authority's website.It marks the second ever deadly incident at the airport since it moved from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok in July 1998. In August 1999, a China Airlines passenger flight crash landed during a typhoon, killing three people.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAlex TaylorGetty ImagesSaying \"no\" to a boss can feel impossible.Whatever our job, we all want to impress rather than disappoint.But ambition can be a very slippery slope. Before you know it, work is coming home with you - seeping into weekends and disrupting time with family and friends.Experts agree learning to set boundaries is the way to stem the flow.Career coach Helen Tupper, co-founder of Squiggly Careers, suggests a simple language shift can help reinforce boundaries. She recommends replacing \"I can't\" with \"I don't\".\"I can't\" invites negotiation - people might try to convince you that you actually can,\" she says. But \"I don't\" is more definitive and harder to challenge.For example you can say \"I don't go to meetings after 5pm on a Wednesday because I pick my kids up then,\" she suggests.Model and TV chef Lorraine Pascale says not doing this ultimately led to her burning out.Alongside her television career, she opened a patisserie in Covent Garden and published a series of cookbooks, all whilst raising her daughter.\"I just wasn't very good at saying no.\"You don't want to upset people, everyone's feeding stuff in your ear as to what you should be doing. So you just keep going,\" she told The Woman's Hour Guide to Life.She adds that her perfectionism, including personally approving every recipe in her books, didn't help.For Lorraine, burnout manifested physically and mentally - including \"not wanting to go near\" cakes.\"It was like an all-body reaction - a tightness in my chest,\" she explains. \"I was having arguments with myself. A lot of self-blame, a lot of guilt, and a lot of tiredness.\"How to be ambitious without burning outLorraine's experience shows burnout can affect anyone at any level, even if statistics suggest it is more likely to happen to women - in part because of added family responsibilities.Dr Claire Ashley, author of The Burnout Doctor - written after experiencing it herself - says on a practical front, sticking to a firm routine over when you finish work each day allows our brains to complete the \"stress cycle\" and enjoy time off.But the real solution is adjusting your goals to your \"current capacity\".\"Ask yourself whether what you want to achieve is reasonable given your mental and emotional resources at the time,\" she says.In Lorraine's case this involved stepping back from cooking and going to therapy. This helped her understand that the toxic elements of her drive to impress stemmed from her childhood in foster care.She's since begun studying psychology herself and says she is \"much better\" - gradually getting back into cooking on more \"intentional\" terms.Of course, stress and long hours are part of any job.But stats show an increase in the number of workers reaching breaking point.Nine out of 10 workers have experienced high or extreme levels of pressure or stress in the past year, research suggests.Feeling stressed or burnt out isn't the same as having clinical burnout - even if we often use the term loosely.Dr Ashley says exhaustion, detachment, and reduced performance are the three defining symptoms.Unless we meet all these, we don't yet have diagnosable burnout. But of course this doesn't mean we're not on the way.'Run your own race'Tupper says it's important to stop, celebrate and acknowledge your own successes, not just focus on the next thing.Doing our best to avoid comparisons with colleagues can also help, so we run our own race, Tupper adds.Of course, not everyone is in a position to push back at work - especially in corporate, or hierarchical job environments.Dr Richard Duggins, an NHS psychiatrist and the author of Burnout-Free Working, often helps patients who feel they can't assert boundaries.He encourages workers to talk to their boss regardless of how junior they are.\"Most employers, even the hard-nosed ones, will listen and make adjustments when they understand that preventing burnout benefits everyone.\"He says setting boundaries, asking for help, or adjusting workload or flexibility can all help, but in the end if the workplace environment doesn't change then we need to make changes to protect ourselves.Appreciating our life stages can be help with this, notes Dr Ashley.\"It's okay to say that someone working part-time, or with family responsibilities, may not be able to match the workload of a younger colleague.\"As Lorraine puts it: \"Ambitious is fine. Being ambitious is a beautiful thing, but just learn to say no more often.\"Other stories you may enjoySign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoFergus WalshMedical editorSheila Irvine, who is registered blind, punches the air with joy at being able to read againA group of blind patients can now read again after being fitted with a life-changing implant at the back of the eye.A surgeon who inserted the microchips in five patients at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London says the results of the international trial are \"astounding\".Sheila Irvine, 70, who is registered blind, told the BBC it was \"out of this world\" to be able to read and do crosswords again. \"It's beautiful, wonderful. It gives me such pleasure.\"The technology offers hope to people with an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), called geographic atrophy (GA), which affects more than 250,000 people in the UK and five million worldwide.In those with the condition, cells in a tiny area of the retina at the back of the eye gradually become damaged and die, resulting in blurred or distorted central vision. Colour and fine detail are often lost.The new procedure involves inserting a tiny 2mm-square photovoltaic microchip, with the thickness of a human hair, under the retina.Patients then put on glasses with a built-in video camera. The camera sends an infrared beam of video images to the implant at the back of the eye, which sends them on to a small pocket processor to be enhanced and made clearer. The images are then sent back to the patient's brain, via the implant and optic nerve, giving them some vision again.The patients spent months learning how to interpret the images. Mahi Muqit, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, who led the UK arm of the trial, told the BBC it was \"pioneering and life-changing technology\".\"This is the first implant that's been demonstrated to give patients meaningful vision that they can use in their daily life, such as reading, writing. \"I think this is a major advance,\" he said.How the implant technology worksFor the research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 38 patients with geographic atrophy in five European countries took part in the trial of the Prima implant, which is made by California biotech Science Corporation.Of 32 patients given the implant, 27 were able to read again using their central vision. After a year, this equated to an improvement of 25 letters, or five lines, on an eye chart.For Sheila, from Wiltshire, the improvement is even more dramatic. Without the implant, she is completely unable to read. But when we filmed Sheila reading an eye chart at Moorfields Hospital, she did not make a single error. After completing it, she punched the air and cheered.'I am one happy bunny'Sheila says she rushes her chores every day in order to sit down and put on the special glassesThe task took huge concentration. Sheila had to put a pillow under her chin in order to steady the feed from the camera, which can focus on just one or two letters at a time. At some points she needed the device switched to magnification mode, especially to distinguish between the letters C and O.Sheila began losing her central vision more than 30 years ago, due to loss of cells in the retina. She describes her vision as like having two black discs in each eye.Sheila gets around using a white cane because her very limited peripheral vision is completely blurred. She is unable to read even the largest street signs when outdoors. When she had to give up her driving licence, she says she cried.But after having an implant fitted around three years ago, she is delighted by her progress, as is the medical team at Moorfields.\"I am able to read my post, books, and do crosswords and Sudoku,\" she says.When asked if she ever thought she'd read again, Sheila replied: \"Not on your nelly!\"\"It is amazing. I am one happy bunny,\" she adds.\"Technology is moving so fast, it's amazing that I am part of it.\"Sheila concentrates hard in order to readSheila doesn't wear the device when outdoors. In part, this is because it requires great concentration - her head has to be held very still in order to read. She also does not want to become over-reliant on the device.Instead, she says she \"rushes her chores\" at home each day before sitting down and putting on the special glasses.The Prima implant is not yet licensed so is not available outside of clinical trials, and it's unclear how much it may eventually cost.Nonetheless, Mahi Muqit said he hoped it would be available to some NHS patients \"within a few years.\"Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of sight loss in old age. It's hoped the technology could be used to help people with other eye conditions in the future.Dr Peter Bloomfield, director of research at Macular Society, says the results are \"encouraging\" and \"fantastic news\" for those who currently have no treatment options.\"Artificial vision may offer a lot of hope to many, particularly after previous disappointments in the world of dry AMD treatment.\"We are now watching closely to see if the Prima implant will be approved for use here in the UK, and crucially whether it could be made available on the NHS.\" The implant would not help restore sight in people born blind, because they don't have a functioning optic nerve to pass signals to the brain.",

    "body": "What Harper Lee's lost short stories reveal about the To Kill A Mockingbird author6 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorGetty ImagesMolly Lee is talking to me about the tales her aunt Nelle, known to the world as Harper Lee, would weave for her when she was a little girl. \"She was just a great storyteller,\" says the 77-year-old from her home in Alabama.That's an understatement if the success of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-prize winning novel To Kill A Mockingbird is anything to go by. Since its publication in 1960, when it was an instant hit, the book has sold more than 42 million copies worldwideBased around the story of Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of rape, it's told through the eyes of two white children, Jean Louise 'Scout' Finch and her brother Jem - and is often described as an American classic.But at the point Molly is describing, before the world had heard of Lee, she was simply an aunt enchanting her niece with stories, often by riffing on one of her favourite authors, the British novelist Daphne Du Maurier.\"The stories that she told me, she would make them up but they all seemed to be based around, 'It was a dark and stormy night'... It seemed to me they were always on the moor and she would just take me into the dark,\" Molly says.Molly's cousin is 77-year-old Ed Lee Conner. His earliest memories of his aunt date back to the late 1940s, when he was tiny. \"She sang to me in a way that was very funny,\" he recalls. \"And I laughed.\" He gives me a rendition, half-singing I've Got a Little List from the musical The Mikado. Ed says he only realised much later that \"she was singing to me songs from Gilbert and Sullivan\", the Victorian-era duo Lee \"adored\" all her life.It seems some of Lee's influences were British, even if her roots were in Monroeville, Alabama at a time of strict segregation, when schools, churches and restaurants were divided on race lines.Casey CepHarper Lee's nephew, Dr Edwin Lee Conner and niece, Molly Lee, who said their aunt was \"funny\" and \"a brilliant writer\"The cousins are sharing their memories of their aunt - who died in 2016  - on the eve of the publication of a new book, The Land of Sweet Forever. It's a series of newly discovered short stories Lee wrote in the years before Mockingbird, as well as previously published essays and magazine pieces.Ed explains: \"I knew there were unpublished stories, I had no idea where the manuscripts of those stories were.\"They were discovered in one of his aunt's New York City apartments after she died, a time capsule from the start of Lee's career which help explain how a young woman from Alabama became a best-selling author whose work addressed the turbulent issues of her age.Molly is \"very pleased\" that the stories have been found. \"I think it's interesting to see how her writing evolved and how she worked on her craft,\" she says. \"Even I can tell how she improved.\"Getty ImagesHarper Lee with her father, Amasa Coleman Lee, newspaper editor and lawyer, who was the inspiration for Atticus Finch, a character who also features in the short story, The Pinking ShearsSome elements will be familiar to fans of To Kill A Mockingbird. Versions of Jean Louise Finch appear, although she hasn't gained her nickname Scout yet. In one of the stories, The Pinking Shears, the character is a spirited little girl called Jean Louie who gives a friend a haircut and faces the wrath of the child's father. Perhaps a hint of the forthright Scout to come? In another, The Binoculars, a child starting school is berated by the teacher for already knowing how to read. A version of that story appears early on in Mockingbird. Some of them are set in Maycomb, Alabama, the fictional town which also stands for Monroeville in To Kill A Mockingbird.Getty ImagesActress Mary Badham and Harper Lee on the set of the To Kill A Mockingbird film, in 1961 at Monroeville, Alabama Ed, who's a retired English professor, calls them \"apprentice stories\" which aren't \"the fullest expression of her genius and yet there's genius in them\". \"She was a brilliant writer in the making and you see something of her brilliance in these stories.\"I found one, The Cat's Meow, an unsettling read through a modern lens. Set in Maycomb, it sees two siblings, clearly Lee and her older sister Alice, confounded by her sister's black gardener Arthur, who's from the North but has apparently decided to work in the segregationist South. The older sister tells the younger one he's a \"Yankee\" who has \"as much education as you have\".Written in 1957, seven years before the groundbreaking Civil Rights Act of 1964, Lee's own approach to the civil rights movement appears to be evolving. Some of the language in the story and at times, even the narrator's own attitudes, are uncomfortable to read.Ed thinks that's a \"fair assessment\"He points to Go Set A Watchman, the novel Lee published just a year before she died after the manuscript was found decades after she wrote it. As liberal as the narrator thinks she is, \"she's not entirely liberated from her own prejudices, let's put it that way\", Ed says.\"And I don't say that in any demeaning sense because for white southerners, it's not easy to rid ourselves of all the prejudices that we have born over the centuries.\"Getty ImagesGregory Peck won an Oscar for his role as Atticus Finch, who defended Tom Robinson (Brock Peters)The publication of Go Set A Watchman sparked controversy. Atticus Finch, the anti-racist hero of To Kill A Mockingbird, is portrayed as a racist. There were questions about whether Lee, who had significant health issues by then, had the capacity to give full consent. (An investigation by the state of Alabama found claims of elder abuse were unfounded).I ask whether it's an invasion of Lee's privacy to publish posthumously these stories that Lee didn't choose to make public in her lifetime. Ed Lee Conner is clear that, when it comes to The Land of Sweet Forever, \"that's an easy judgment to make, she attempted to publish all these stories\".And he believes - like Mockingbird - the stories have something to say about modern race relations in the US which is \"part of the continuing relevance of what she wrote\".To Kill A Mockingbird \"had a huge influence on the way a lot of people thought about race relations in the United States\".Writing a book about a black man's struggle that's centred on white characters, particularly Atticus Finch, the white lawyer played by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film, has led, in later years, to accusations of white saviourism. Ed tells me his aunt \"was writing a novel primarily for a white audience who I think would need to see a figure like Atticus Finch much more clearly and much more humanly in their lives, even as a fictional character, in order to influence them as much as she could\".Getty ImagesPresident George W. Bush awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Harper Lee in 2007, for her contribution to literatureIn an interview in 1964 for the New York radio station WQXR, Harper Lee described the \"sheer numbness\" she felt at the reaction to her debut novel.\"I never expected that the book would sell in the first place,\" she said. \"I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers. I was hoping that maybe somebody might like it well enough to give me some encouragement about it.\"Ed's side of the family had been given it in proof, ahead of publication. At age 13, he read the whole book in two days. \"I was absolutely enthralled and it was one of the highlights of my youth.\"He says the whole family shared her feelings of numbness at its reception. \"We all loved it and thought it was a terrific novel, but we had no idea... that it would go on to be as phenomenal a success as it was.\"Harper Lee had looked after Molly and her brother while she was writing it. \"She was in her bedroom typing away and she locked the door and she'd come out and play with us and then go back to typing.\"When Molly read the book, as a 12-year-old, \"I'm not sure that I ever looked up from it. I was totally engrossed.\"Dr Edwin Lee Conner/Harper Lee EstateOn the left: Harper Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee in his home in Monroeville with his grandchildren (including Ed Lee Conner with hat and Molly Lee standing) in 1953, and on the right, a previously unseen photograph of Nelle Harper LeeI play them part of the WQXR interview that their aunt did four years after the book came out. It's the only known recording of Harper Lee talking about To Kill A Mockingbird.She retired from public life soon afterwards. Ed says she wasn't a recluse as some have suggested and was very sociable with the people she knew. She'd simply realised, after the novel's success and then the hugely popular film, that she didn't need to promote it anymore.\"She did not particularly enjoy public appearances,\" he recalls. \"She had no interest whatsoever in being a celebrity. So there was a point at which she decided no more interviews.\"Michael BrownHarper Lee, whose writing changed \"the way we saw each other, and then the way we saw ourselves\" -- in a tribute from the former US President Barack ObamaListening to her speaking on this precious recording is its own time capsule. In her soft southern accent, melodic and lilting, she talks not just about being numbed at the reaction to the book, but also why she believes the southern states are \"a region of storytellers\" and how she wants to be \"a Jane Austen of South Alabama\".Hearing her voice again \"just makes me smile,\" Molly says.\"I love hearing it,\" agrees Ed, clearly moved. \"It's wonderful.\"The Land of Sweet Forever by Harper Lee is published on 21 October 2025.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoJoshua AskewSouth East andSimon FinlayLocal Democracy Reporting ServiceThe Reform leader of Kent County Council refused to confirm if the suspensions were linked to the videoReform UK has suspended four councillors following the leak of a video of a heated virtual council meeting.The councillors sit on Kent County Council (KCC), one of ten local authorities run by Reform UK and seen by the party as a test case of its ability to govern. It comes after a clip was leaked to The Guardian of KCC leader Linden Kemkaran swearing and telling party members to \"suck it up\" regarding her decisions.When asked by BBC Radio Kent if the suspensions were linked to the video, she declined to comment. \"It is business as usual at Kent County Council,\" she said.A Reform UK spokesperson said Paul Thomas, Oliver Bradshaw, Bill Barret and Maxine Fothergrill have had the whip suspended pending an investigation. They said the suspensions were the result of \"evidence\" the councillors \"brought the party into disrepute\".Getty ImagesA leaked video appears to show councillor Kemkaran telling councillors from her party to \"suck it up\"Councillor Kemkaran was heard in the clip raising her voice at councillor Thomas during an exchange on local government reorganisation.Kent's 14 councils are set to abolish themselves under government proposals and be replaced with three or four new, larger unitary bodies.In the leaked clip, councillor Kemkaran tells the councillors: \"I am not a dictator or an autocrat. I like feedback. I like to discuss.\"However, when it comes to making the really big decisions, and LGR [local government reorganisation] is one of those really big decisions... sometimes I will make a decision that might not be liked by everybody in the group.\"She then uses an expletive as she tells them they will have to \"suck it up\", prompting one councillor to gasp open-mouthed, before laughing.The Guardian said that the comments sparked dissent from others in the meeting, including councillor Thomas who said backbenchers were not being briefed on the plans. He said to the meeting: \"Quite frankly, the question is…is that the right leader and the right cabinet?\"As councillor Kemkaran and councillor Thomas continued with their heated exchanges, often speaking over each other, councillor Thomas said: \"The problem is, it's easier when it's face-to-face.\"As he attempted to continue, councillor Kemkaran replied angrily: \"I am meant to be on bloody holiday this week Paul! I don't want to be having this meeting.\"She then said the meeting was \"running out of time\" and threatened to mute councillor Thomas, which prompted deputy leader Brian Collins to burst into laughter.\"You keep laughing your head off mate,\" councillor Thomas said.'Treachery'Suspended councillor Ms Fothergrill denied allegations she was the source of the leaked video. \"Reform UK has a once in a lifetime generation mission to save our country,\" she said. \"Distractions like this will only play into the hands of our opponents.\"Rosie Duffield, an Independent MP for Canterbury, said Reform UK looks \"chaotic\" and \"unprofessional\".She said councillor Kemkaran seemed more concerned with ending the meeting to go on holiday than about discussing issues affecting people in Kent.Ms Duffield added that the council leader should \"seriously\" consider resigning. Councillor Kemkaran previously said those behind the leak were \"weak\" and \"foolish\" to have committed an act of \"treachery\", and that a \"thorough investigation\" had been launched.She could face a vote of no confidence in the coming weeks over the leaked video, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The LDRS reported that a backbencher, who has asked not to be named, has already begun seeking the required number of signatures to spark the possible dismissal. Councillor Anthony Hook, opposition leader of KCC, has called councillor Kemkaran's position \"untenable\" and said she is \"unfit to lead\".  Reform UK took control of KCC - the biggest local authority in the country - in May, after winning 57 of the 81 seats, overturning a 30-year Tory majority.  Suspended councillor Oliver Bradshaw declined to comment. The other suspended councillors Paul Thomas  and Bill Barret have been approached by the BBC. More on this storyRelated internet links",

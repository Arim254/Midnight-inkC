From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "36 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe UK has become the \"most expensive place in the world\" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review detailing the \"overly complex\" bureaucracy around the sector.The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, called for a \"radical reset\" in the government's nuclear strategy to make projects safer and more efficient.Doing so could save Britain \"tens of billions\" in costs and reverse the industry's \"decline\" in recent years, the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce found.It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plans to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets.The report found that a \"fragmented\" regulatory system has led to a lack of industry-wide safety oversight, which has led to \"conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed\".It described the industry as \"near-monopolistic\", and said both civil and defence programmes are prone to \"large cost overruns and schedule delays\".Nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - are \"essential to the UK's future\", with the country at risk of missing out on a \"worldwide nuclear renaissance\".The report said the UK has excessively risk-averse policies in place, including \"overly conservative\" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers.Among its recommendations is a \"one-stop\" commission for nuclear decisions. The agency should have \"unified\" decision-making powers.Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: \"Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably.\"The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget.The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions.Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024.The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are  ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030.plants are being developed but they will take several years to come online.Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also setting up small nuclear power stations, which are faster to build than full size reactors.",

    "body": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron has revealed he has been treated for prostate cancer.Lord Cameron, 59, told the Times newspaper his wife had insisted he go for a check-up after being inspired by a BBC radio interview with entrepreneur Nick Jones, who was campaigning for more men to be tested after being diagnosed himself.Lord Cameron had a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test earlier this year, followed by an MRI scan and a biopsy. A PSA test looks for proteins associated with prostate cancer and the result was high in Lord Cameron's case.He was treated with focal therapy, which targets the area where the tumour is present using methods such as ultrasound waves to destroy cancer cells.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with around 55,000 new cases every year.Lord Cameron told the newspaper he wanted to use his platform to support a call by Prostate Cancer Research, a charity which counts Mr Jones - founder of private members' club chain Soho House - as a trustee, for screening to be offered to high-risk men.The cancer is most common in older age - among men over 75. Cases in the under-50s are rare. It is also more common in black men.\"I don't particularly like discussing my personal intimate health issues, but I feel I ought to,\" Lord Cameron said.\"Let's be honest. Men are not very good at talking about their health. We tend to put things off.\"But he said: \"I sort of thought, well, this has happened to you, and you should lend your voice to it.\"Lord Cameron, Conservative prime minister between 2010 and 2016 and later foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak's government, told the Times: \"I would feel bad if I didn't come forward and say that I've had this experience. I had a scan. It helped me discover something that was wrong. It gave me the chance to deal with it.\"There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.But the peer's intervention comes days after a major prostate cancer screening trial began in the country. It is aimed at finding the best way to detect the disease.Around one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lives, according to Prostate Cancer UK, with research showing it has overtaken breast cancer as the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease in the UK.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "Skye Gyngell, the first Australian female chef to win a coveted Michelin star, has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her garden centre cafe in south-west London was awarded one of the highest honours for chefs. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Born in Sydney, Gyngell was the daughter of Bruce Gyngell, the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956, and interior designer Ann Barr. She studied law at Sydney University before deciding the culinary world was for her, moving to Paris when she was 19 years where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.She later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.",

    "body": "A \"tremendous amount of progress\" has been achieved in talks to finalise a US-proposed peace plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said.But \"there's still some work to be done\", Rubio said after meeting Ukrainian and European negotiators in Geneva, Switzerland.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there were \"signals that President [Donald] Trump's team is hearing us\". Ukraine and its European allies had expressed concern over the leaked proposals, seen as favouring Russia and welcomed by Vladimir Putin as \"the basis\" for settlement. Zelensky had said Ukraine \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\".Speaking to reporters late on Sunday, Rubio said the negotiating teams in Geneva had had a \"very good day\".He said the main goal had been to try to narrow \"open items\" from the 28-point US plan - and the parties involved had achieved that in a \"substantial way\".However, America's top diplomat added that any final agreement would have to be agreed by the Ukrainian and US presidents - before the package was sent to Russia -  and that there were still a couple of issues they need to continue to work on.A joint US-Ukraine statement issued later on Sunday said that an \"updated and refined peace framework\" had been agreed by both countries, and that they agreed to \"intensive work on joint proposals in the coming days\".Several media outlets reported they had seen an alternative plan from Kyiv's European allies led by the UK, France and Germany. The BBC has not seen the document and Rubio denied any knowledge of its existence. Earlier on Sunday, Trump accused Ukraine's leaders of showing \"zero gratitude\" for US efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war.The US president also pointed out that Europe - where Kyiv has some of its staunchest allies - was continuing to buy oil from Russia.Moscow relies heavily on its oil and gas exports to continue financing its war in Ukraine.The Geneva talks are focusing on the US draft, the leaked version of which includes a Ukrainian troop withdrawal from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and the de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region in addition to the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US plan also limits Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel - from about 880,000 now.The draft crucially includes a pledge for Ukraine not to seek membership of Nato. Instead, Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\" about which no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and its troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses.Trump has given Ukraine until this coming Thursday to agree the proposals. But he then said this was not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukraine's allies from Europe, Canada and Japan voiced concerns.And Rubio told reporters on Sunday he was \"very optimistic that we're going to get there in a very reasonable period of time very soon\", whether it was Thursday, other days, or Monday the following week.Before the talks began in Geneva, Rubio and the State Department were forced to insist the widely-leaked plan had been authored by the US.That came after a bipartisan group of US senators claimed the secretary of state had told them the draft was a Russian proposal and did not represent the Trump administration's position.Rubio rebutted that account and said it had been authored by the US with \"input\" from Moscow and Kyiv, while a State Department spokesperson described the senators' account of their conversation with Rubio as \"blatantly false\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorReutersBusiness leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage.Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.PA MediaBudget ingredientsSo what might be in the mix?Business rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.On Monday Business Secretary Peter Kyle will address the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference, and will have a couple of business-friendly policies to announce, including a consultation on how to lower energy bills for 7,000 businesses and a command to the British Business Bank to focus its lending on the eight \"high potential\" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative. It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis. That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.The additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.Among bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one. Rain Newton-Smith, head of the CBI, will use her speech on Monday to call for the government to change course, saying the policy deters hiring. There is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.The chancellor is also expected to speak about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come. Restoring faithWhat the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.After months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.According to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.But confidence is still very fragile. The chancellor will need to handle with care.",

    "body": "12 hours agoDearbail JordanUK Ministry of DefenceA view from HMS Severn as it tracks Russia's RFN Stoikiy in the English ChannelTwo Russian warships were intercepted in the English Channel by the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.In the latest incident involving Russia's ships entering waters around the UK, HMS Severn headed off the RFN Stoikiy, a corvette and Yelnya, a tanker, as they sailed west through the Dover Strait into the English Channel in the past fortnight.Last week, it emerged that the Russian spy ship Yantar was spotted off the coast of Scotland and it used lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its movements.Defence Secretary John Healey branded the Yantar's move \"deeply dangerous\" and warned Russia and its president Vladimir Putin: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. We are ready.\"Healey said last week that there had been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.The MoD said after intercepting the Stoikiy and the Yelnya, the HMS Severn later handed over monitoring duties to a Nato ally off the coast of Brittany, north west France.It said the UK ship \"continued to observe from a distance and remained ready to respond to any unexpected activity\".It is not the first time the Stoikiy has been in British territory.In May, the Royal Navy dispatched two vessels and the 814 Naval Air Squadron - also known as the \"flying tigers\" - to shadow the Russian warship as it sailed west through the English Channel to meet the Sparta IV and General Skobelev.The two merchant vessels were returning from the Mediterranean and the group headed back to the Baltic Sea, watched by HMS Hurworth.Healey has said that the rise in Russian activity in UK waters was evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.At a news conference in Downing Street last week, the defence secretary said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".Built in 2002, HMS Severn is a River-class offshore patrol vessel. Together with her sister ships, HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey, the Royal Navy says the ships are able to \"escort passing foreign warships, mount fishing vessel inspections and defend the UK border\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPA MediaThe Princess of Wales has called for an end to the \"stigma\" surrounding addiction, and urged people to offer \"empathy and support\" to those dependent on alcohol, drugs or gambling.Catherine, who sent the message to mark Addiction Awareness Week, said \"significant progress\" has been made to better understand addiction, but warned more needs to be done.The princess is the patron of The Forward Trust, a charity that tries to break the cycle of addiction and is behind the campaign running from 23-30 November.Catherine, who has also campaigned on mental health issues, draws parallels between the two conditions in her message.She said addiction was \"not a choice or a personal failing, but a complex mental health condition that should be met with empathy and support.She added: \"But still, even now in 2025, people's experience of addiction is shaped by fear, shame and judgement. This needs to change.\"The stigma surrounding those who face addiction allows it to thrive behind closed doors, impacting families and communities, and ultimately ruining lives.\"The princess said that many people will know someone who is struggling with addiction.\"Now is the moment to show our compassion and love to help them, or their friends and family, to reach out to organisations like The Forward Trust for support,\" she said.\"Recovery is hard, but with the right treatment it is possible. And this begins with a conversation, a listening ear and showing we care.\"Catherine launched the first Addiction Awareness Week in 2021 on behalf of the trust and its Taking Action on Addiction campaign.She concluded her message by urging people to have open conversations to bring addiction and the harm it causes \"out of the shadows\".PA MediaCatherine launched the charity's campaign in 2021It is not the first time Catherine has spoken out on the issue of addiction.In 2022, she gave her personal support to people struggling with addictions, telling them shame should not stop them getting help and urging a more compassionate public attitude towards the condition.Former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who spent 11 years in addiction, has also recorded a video to launch a series of films demonstrating the power of open conversations in the journey to recovery.In the film, he reveals that a conversation with his mother-in-law Barbara was the catalyst to getting help.Adams, who is now chairman of trustees at the Forward Trust, said: \"If you are struggling with an addiction or a mental health issue, then please reach out and get the appropriate help. The greatest thing I ever did was to say, 'I can't do this'.\"The charity provides services including helping with employment and addressing the problems of addicts and addictions in prison.Before the Princess of Wales became the Forward Trust's patron, she had twice visited the charity's substance misuse services at HMP Send, a women's prison in Surrey.The trust has also called for greater recognition of the scale of gambling inside prisons.",

    "body": "Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett and former prime minister Baroness Theresa May are among the six public figures who will guest edit BBC Radio 4's Today programme over the Christmas period.Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, historian and podcaster Tom Holland, inventor Sir James Dyson and Microsoft's head of artificial intelligence (AI) Mustafa Suleyman will also guest edit shows between 24 December and 31 December.For the past 22 years, the news programme has handed over the editorial reins to guest editors during the festive period.Owenna Griffiths, editor of Today, said: \"In a rapidly changing world, this year's guest editors will help bring illumination and understanding\".She added: \"Every Christmas on Today, a new set of guest editors take up residence and bring with them a wonderful range of new stories, fresh ideas and, hopefully, a sprinkling of joy. This year is no exception.\"Blanchett's show on 27 December is set to look at the impact of AI technology on women in the film industry, and how different countries are responding to the refugee crisis.She is also expected to explore sustainability in the fashion industry and why gardening is good for the soul.The guest editors kick off on Christmas Eve, with a programme from Bragg focused on the origins of the nativity story, as well as changing social attitudes to mental health. He will also examine the value of culture in British society as he looks back on his six-decade career, which has included The South Bank Show, as well as Radio 4 documentary series In Our Time. On Boxing Day, an edit by Sir James - the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner - will consider how the UK could boost its entrepreneurial spirit.Other topics up for discussion in his programme include how close we are to finding a dementia cure and the science behind long-distance running.Suleyman is scheduled to look at how we could navigate the realities of a potential world with artificial super intelligence on 29 December.He is also set to reflect on what AI will mean for some of the core aspects of human existence.Holland's show on 30 December is set to celebrate England's 1,100th birthday and explore the impact of AI on academic research.Then on New Year's Eve, Baroness May's guest edit is set to cover domestic violence, trust in politics and modern slavery. Since the Christmas guest edit feature was introduced to Today in 2003, guest editors on the show have included physicist Stephen Hawking, actress Angelina Jolie and singer Ellie Goulding.",

The 18-year-old, who was beaten in last year's final by Luke Humphries, added a new trophy to his cabinet just a week after lifting the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton and topping the world rankings for the first time.Aspinall battled hard in the decider, reducing the deficit to 9-8 at one stage by winning four out of five legs, but Littler held firm and hit a checkout of 88 to secure his sixth televised title.\"I am very proud to get this one ticked off the list - only two more to go now,\" Littler told ITV after the win. The only major trophies missing from Littler's collection now are the European Championship and the World Masters. Littler averaged 103.33 to Aspinall's 93.64 in Sunday's final though his opponent threw seven maximum 180s - one more than 'The Nuke'. \"It wasn't easy to get to this final at all,\" Littler said. \"[Aspinall] has been playing really well for a good few weeks now and I had to dig in at the end there. I am glad I got the job done.\"Earlier in my career, I was just trying to be myself but now I am starting to let out a bit of my emotion. I'm looking to the big one next month.\"Earlier in the day, Littler defeated Chris Dobey 10-5 in the last 16 before overcoming top seed and former world champion Gerwyn Price, of Wales, 11-8 to book his place in the final. Meanwhile, Aspinall had breezed into his seventh major final by beating Jermaine Wattimena of the Netherlands 11-2. \"I don't know how [Littler] has this energy,\" Aspinall said. \"He is incredible. What he has done for this game is incredible and I was happy to share that stage with him.\"Meanwhile, England's Beau Greaves suffered a 6-3 loss to Gian van Veen in the final of the World Youth Championship in Minehead. Greaves had posted a thrilling 6-5 victory over world champion Luke Littler last month to become the first woman to reach the World Youth final.But the 21-year-old from Doncaster fell 4-1 behind to defending champion Van Veen before mounting a comeback to almost level the tie at 4-3. However, Van Veen, who was beaten by Poland's Krzysztof Ratajski in the second round at the Players Championship, held his nerve to become only the second player to retain the youth title after Dimitri van den Bergh in 2018. Greaves, a three-time WDF women's world champion, ended the PDC Women's Series with an 86-match winning run and will play in the World Championship which starts at Alexandra Palace on 11 December.",

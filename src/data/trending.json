    "body": "12 hours agoSimon JonesSouth EastGetty ImagesThe government said the new powers will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangsNew powers allowing mobile phones to be seized from illegal migrants without arresting them have come into force. The government said it will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings to the UK.The Home Office said seizures will begin on Monday at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, with technology on site ready to download intelligence from devices.Officers will be able to demand that migrants remove their coats to search for phones and also check their mouths for SIM cards.The National Crime Agency said the information collected could speed up investigations into smuggling gangs.Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.\"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.\"The Refugee Council said it was important that the new powers were used proportionately. It said phones were a lifeline for vulnerable people who needed to remain in contact with their families.Mike Tapp, minister for migration and citizenship, said seized phones could later be returned but that would \"depend on the individual circumstances... what's found on that phone. That's for the guys on the ground to make that operational decision.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"If people have devices... that could hold intelligence, then we are right to be able to seize that. But that  doesn't take away compassion.\" The new law also introduces offences that could leave perpetrators facing up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK.Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could face five years in prison.Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, said more than 4,000 disruptions against smuggling gangs had taken place since his unit was set up, including seizing cash and convicting key players.He said Monday marked a \"key moment\" to go further with extra tools to crack down on smugglers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also announced plans for \"significant changes\" to the asylum system to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour had confined itself to \"cosmetic tweaks\" and that there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel.He said the Conservatives would leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something Labour has rejected in favour of reforming the treaty.\"With more than 41,000 people arriving in 2025, the government needs to get a proper grip on the situation,\" he added.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "All 116 people injured in a bar fire at a Swiss ski resort have now been identified, officials have said.Forty people were killed when a fire tore through a busy venue in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, with victims' age ranging from 14 to 39 years old.While the dead had all previously been identified, work had been ongoing to establish who the injured are, some of whom remain in a critical condition. Swiss police confirmed on Monday that 83 people remained in hospital, with the injured including at least 12 nationalities.Most of the injured suffered severe burns, which in some cases meant they could not be identified, police have said.Investigators said 119 people had been injured but that number has been revised down in the latest update. A criminal investigation has been launched into the French couple who managed the Le Constellation bar - a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling were the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Details have begun to emerge about some of those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Among them was Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, who was a pupil at two UK schools. Her family wrote on social media: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"The mother of Arthur Brodard, 16, confirmed he had died in the fire.She said in a video message: \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as also being among the victims.Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoAmir AzimiBBC News PersianEPAThe protests have spread from Tehran to other cities across the countryIran is no stranger to street protests, but several factors surrounding the current unrest make it very serious. Monday marks the ninth day since demonstrations broke out, yet even four or five days were enough for President Trump to issue a direct warning to Iranian leaders over the treatment of protesters, saying the US was \"locked and loaded\". Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday.Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed. Now eyes are on Trump's possible move.The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago.Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next. Official annual inflation stands at around 42%, food inflation exceeds 70%, and some basic goods have reportedly risen in price by more than 110%. Vulnerable positionInternational sanctions led by the United States have played a major role in worsening economic conditions, but they are not the full story. High-profile corruption cases in Iranian courts involving senior officials and their families have reinforced public anger and the belief that parts of the ruling elite are exploiting the crisis. Many ordinary Iranians believe that certain officials and their relatives benefit directly from sanctions through special arrangements that allow them to control imports and exports, move oil revenues abroad, and profit from money laundering networks. Even the government officials believe those who are locally called \"Sanctions Profiteers\" are to blame more than the sanctions themselves.EPAThe protests began over the economy but have also become politicalMerchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar were among the first groups to openly protest, closing their shops in response to daily currency fluctuations and taking to the streets to demand government intervention to stabilise the markets. Demonstrations soon spread beyond the bazaar to other segments of society. Economic slogans quickly turned political, with calls for the removal of the entire Islamic Republic itself. Students joined the protests, followed by small businesses in other cities and towns and other ordinary Iranians. Within days, chants against Iran's supreme leader once again became a central feature of the demonstrations.The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. Those demonstrations, which later became known as the \"Mahsa Movement\" or \"Woman, Life, Freedom\", shook the foundations of the state but were eventually suppressed through force and mass arrests.Although the current protests have spread rapidly and persisted for days, they have not yet reached the scale or intensity of the 2022 demonstrations. Journalists in Iran are under immense pressure, and independent international news organisations are either not allowed to report from inside the country or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. As a result, much of what is known comes from social media and people on the streets sharing what they witness and record. This makes verification increasingly difficult, especially as social media can also provide fertile ground for fabrications, unfounded claims, and distorted realities, a challenge further intensified by the rise of AI.Against this backdrop, many observers believe the present situation could have more serious consequences than 2022. Iran's government is widely seen as being at its weakest point in decades, facing simultaneous pressure from domestic unrest and a dramatically altered regional environment.Series of setbacksThe 12-day war in the summer of 2025 between Iran and Israel marked a turning point. The conflict culminated in direct US involvement, including air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. ReutersIran's missile and other military sites were badly damaged in the war with Israel The war severely damaged Iran's defence capacity, nuclear infrastructure, and several military and industrial sites. At the same time, Iran's broader regional position has deteriorated. The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria deprived Tehran of a key ally, while sustained Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon eliminated much of the group's senior leadership. More recently, US operations in Venezuela and snatching of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have further narrowed Iran's options abroad.These developments have reshaped the regional and international environment for Tehran. Iran now has fewer allies to rely on in regional conflicts and fewer channels to move oil revenues overseas. This is particularly significant given Iran's heavy involvement in Venezuela's oil sector alongside Russia, and its reliance on complex financial arrangements linked to markets believed to be in China.The disruption of these networks has increased Iran's economic vulnerability at a time of mounting internal pressure.Against this backdrop, Iran's aging supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appears to be facing one of the most uncertain moments of his rule. More than three decades of careful planning to build regional proxy forces, sanction-evasion mechanisms, and nuclear infrastructure have been undermined or destroyed in a relatively short period of time. With Trump back in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu in power in Israel, there appears to be no clear diplomatic or strategic path out of the current crisis without a hefty price.For years, Khamenei and his inner circle justified massive spending on regional allies and the nuclear program as necessary investments in Iran's long-term security and technological advancement. Today, that argument appears increasingly hollow. As pressure builds both inside and outside the country, security at home, once presented as the ultimate payoff of those policies, seems more distant than ever.",

On 29 January 2024 he is accused of grabbing her \"tightly around the neck\".He indicated he would plead not guilty to three counts of intentional strangulation and was released on bail to appear at Oxford Crown Court on 5 February.Getty ImagesThe duke married Edla Griffiths, his second wife, in 2002 but they separated in 2024The court was told the 2022 incident occurred following an argument in the garden of their home.The second accusation describes Edla Marlborough running into a laundry room before being attacked.Prosecutors said on the occasion in 2024, the duke, who gave his address as Blenheim Palace, grabbed her around the neck before throwing her on a bed.The twice-married aristocrat, formerly known as the Marquess of Blandford, married his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, in 2002.They are said to have met while she was living in Chelsea and working on her art, and they wed after dating for seven years.The pair are thought to have separated in 2024.He inherited his dukedom in 2014, following the death of his father, the 11th Duke of Marlborough.He is a first cousin, three times removed, of Sir Winston Churchill and a distant relative of the late Princess Diana through the Spencer family.His ancestral family home is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock – Sir Winston's birthplace - which is owned and managed by Blenheim Palace Heritage Foundation.The foundation said, in a previous statement, it was \"unable to comment on the charges, which relate to the duke's personal conduct and private life, and which are subject to live, criminal proceedings\".It added: \"The foundation is not owned or managed by the Duke of Marlborough, but by independent entities run by boards of trustees.\"Blenheim PalaceFormer Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim PalaceRelated storiesRelated link",

    "body": "A former contestant on TV show The Apprentice sent a string of antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media, a medical tribunal has been told.Dr Asif Munaf, who is from Sheffield, is said to have posted and reposted the \"seriously offensive\" comments from his X account on various dates between October 2023 and July 2025.He appeared on the 2024 edition of The Apprentice but was dropped from The Apprentice: You're Fired! after he was accused of posting antisemitic comments on social media.The 37-year-old, who has not attended the tribunal and is not legally represented, denied the posts were antisemitic at a previous hearing.On Monday the General Medical Council (GMC) outlined the misconduct allegations against the doctor, who is registered under his full name Mohammed Asif Munaf.According to the GMC, Munaf posted multiple antisemitic statements, including Holocaust denial, conspiracy theories and rhetoric equating Jews with Nazism.Harriet Tighe, lawyer for the GMC, said one post was accompanied by an image of a flag including the Star of David above a swastika.Munaf also reposted a comment which referred to boxer Floyd Mayweather using a derogatory racial slur.In a separate post, Munaf expressed sexist views, arguing that certain professions should be restricted by gender and criticised female empowerment.At a previous hearing, he said the posts were \"not befitting of someone as educated as myself and were said in the heat of the emotion\".He is also accused by the GMC of \"disappearing\" just hours into a locum placement as a cardiology specialist registrar at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust in January 2024 as he walked out without notice or good reason.In a separate allegation, he is said to have provided a sick note to a patient in November 2024 while he was suspended from practice.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing continues.Additional reporting by PA Media.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterHigh street retailers Claire's and The Original Factory Shop are being put into administration, risking 2,500 jobs.It comes amid a turbulent time for Claire's, popular with tweens for its brightly coloured accessories, which was seeking a buyer after its US owner filed for bankruptcy last year.Modella Capital, which owns both chains, said the retailers would enter insolvency proceedings across the UK and Ireland. The administration will give them breathing space to find a new buyer.Modella said tough trading conditions and \"alarming\" low Christmas trading left both in a \"vulnerable\" position.Claire's has 154 stores and 1,355 staff, while The Original Factory shop has 140 stores and 1,220 staff.Modella purchased Claire's in September, six weeks after its previous collapse into administration, in a deal which saw around 1,000 job losses at the retailer, while 145 stores closed.The investment firm has owned The Original Factory Shop since early last year.\"This has been a very tough decision,\" said Modella. \"We have worked intensively in an effort to save both businesses, having made last-ditch attempts to rescue them, but neither has a realistic possibility of trading profitably again.\"Modella said that the chains were \"highly vulnerable\" even before it bought them. It also blamed challenges including the climate on the high street, which it said \"remains extremely challenging\", and government policy.The two shops are the latest casualties of a tough trading environment which has seen high street sales fall as shoppers move online, ditching old favourites facing the high cost of maintaining brick-and-mortar stores.\"A combination of very weak consumer confidence, highly adverse government fiscal policies and continued cost inflation is causing many established and much-loved businesses to suffer badly,\" Modella said.The investment firm has become increasingly prominent on Britain's high streets, having bought WH Smith's high street chain last year and taken over arts and crafts retailer Hobbycraft a year earlier.Modella is the latest business to criticise measures by Chancellor Rachel Reeves which have seen operating costs rise, making trading even more difficult as high inflation - the price at which prices rise - squeezes household budgets.Her last Budget hiked taxes, while her previous Budget increased the minimum wage and raised employer National Insurance contributions.One London pub owner warned he may have to close after tax rises announced in the last Budget. James Fitzgerald, landlord of the Thatched House in Hammersmith, said his costs have risen by £22,000 over the past year - with the increase in National Insurance a major factor.The Treasury was asked to comment.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandKathryn ArmstrongTen people have been found guilty of cyber-bullying Brigitte Macron, the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, by a Paris court. The defendants were accused of spreading false claims about her gender and sexuality, as well as making \"malicious remarks\" about the 24-year age gap between the couple. Most of the defendants were handed suspended prison sentences of up to eight months, but one was jailed immediately for failing to attend court. Some had their social media accounts suspended.The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.But last year there was a radical change of course. The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.",

    "body": "The Cuban government says 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It described the dead as members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies were killed \"in combat actions\", declaring two days of national mourning. The armed forces added the Cubans \"fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombardments of installations\"Cuba, a long-standing ally of Venezuela, has for years supplied Maduro with his personal security detail and has personnel throughout the Venezuelan military.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said the country had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. US spies had been monitoring Maduro's movements for months before US forces struck, according to US General Dan Caine.Gen Caine said that they had learned where the former leader moved, lived, travelled, ate, and worked.The New York Times reported that the CIA had also recruited a \"Venezuelan source\"  who it says informed the Americans of Maduro's exact location.Many of those killed are believed to have been part of Maduro's close security detail, who were with him at the time. Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed, but its armed forces  have said that a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties.An official statement from the Cuban government read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism\".The total death toll - according to an unnamed Venezuelan official cited by the New York Times - stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the seizure of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor, Joe Biden, easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoPeter Hoskins,Osmond Chia,Nick EdserandNatalie Sherman,Business reportersShares in US energy companies have jumped as investors bet that the US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro will open opportunities to tap the country's oil reserves. Shares in Chevron opened more than 4% higher, after surging more than 7% in pre-market trading, while other firms, including ConocoPhillips and Exxon also gained. Precious metal prices and shares in defence stocks also rose as the intervention increased investors' concerns about geopolitical risks.Gold was about 1.9% higher at $4,412 (£3,275) an ounce, while the price of silver was up by 3.6%, as money was moved into so-called \"safe-haven\" assets.Prices of precious metals such as gold and silver often rise in times of uncertainty as they are seen as safer assets to hold. The gold price saw its best annual performance last year since 1979 after rising by more than 60%, reaching an all-time high of $4,549.71 on 26 December.Those gains were driven by several factors including expectations of more interest rate cuts, major purchases of bullion by central banks and investor concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.Oil prices fluctuated on Monday as investors weighed whether Washington's intervention in Venezuela would affect crude supplies. Brent crude rose more than 1% to nearly $61.50 a barrel, still below highs seen in recent years, as analysts said ample global supplies would offset any disruption.Shares in Chevron, the only US company currently operating in Venezuela, rose 4%, while Spanish energy firm Repsol, among the other few Western energy firms with a presence in the country, gained 2%.Oil services firms also climbed, with Haliburton up more than 7%. US President Donald Trump has vowed to tap into Venezuela's vast oil reserves after seizing Maduro and said that the US will \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".But industry analysts have said the move is unlikely to have an immediate impact on how much people and businesses pay for energy.Experts have also said it would cost billions of dollars to fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure, which has been in sharp decline since the early 2000s.Venezuela's crude production has been \"lacklustre\" for years and now only accounts for around 1% of global oil output, said investment strategist Vasu Menon from OCBC bank.The former chief executive of BP, Lord Browne, told the BBC's Today programme that for Venezuela to revive its oil production would take \"a tremendous amount of skill investment and time\". While there might be a \"quick pick up\" of some production, he added, output might actually fall while the industry is reorganising.Shares in defence stocks across Europe rose sharply as investors reacted to the US actions in Venezuela.In the UK, shares in BAE Systems rose 5% while Germany's Rheinmetall jumped more than 8%.\"Heightened geopolitical tensions like the ones we've seen over the weekend would normally spook investors, but global markets have avoided a sell-off,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Defence stocks often move higher when there are heightened tensions between two countries as investors believe events could spur governments to spend more on military protection.\"It was only natural to see the sector in demand after Venezuela's leader was captured,\" he added.Mining firms also rose following the gain in precious metals prices, with Endeavour Mining and Fresnillo both up more than 4%. Share markets in Asia made gains as investors focused on news unrelated to developments in Venezuela.Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 3% on the first day of trading of the year and new data showed that manufacturing activity stabilised in December.Major indexes in South Korea and China were also higher.The jumps reflect confidence that the fallout from events in Venezuela will remain distant, said Zavier Wong from investment firm eToro.",

    "body": "40 minutes agoMadeline Halpertin court in New YorkThe sound of clanking leg shackles could be heard moments before Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro walked into the door of a New York City courtroom for the first time.He then told packed rows of reporters and the public that he had just been \"kidnapped\". Minutes after his entrance, the Judge Alvin Hellerstein asked Maduro to confirm his identity so the proceedings could start. \"I am, sir, Nicolás Maduro. I am president of the Republic of Venezuela and I am here kidnapped since January 3rd,\" he told the court in a calm Spanish before an interpreter translated for the court. \"I was captured at my home in Caracas, Venezuela.\" The 92-year-old judge quickly interjected to tell Maduro that there would be a \"time and a place to get into all of this\". During the dramatic 40-minute arraignment on Monday afternoon, Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty to drugs and weapon charges. \"I'm innocent. I'm a decent man,\" Maduro said, with Flores adding that she was \"completely innocent\". The 63-year-old and his wife were transferred to a New York jail after they were arrested by US forces at their compound in Venezuela on Saturday, as part of a surprise overnight operation that also saw strikes on military bases.Dressed in blue and orange jail shirts and khaki pants, the two wore headphones to listen to a Spanish translation during the hearing, an attorney sitting between them. Maduro took meticulous notes on a yellow legal pad that he asked a judge to confirm that he could keep with him after the hearing. When Maduro walked into the room - the same federal courtroom where Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was tried and convicted just months earlier - he turned around to nod at several members of the audience and greet them. He maintained this calm and expressionless demeanour during the proceedings, even at the end, when a man watching from the public area suddenly shouted that Maduro would \"pay\" for his crimes. \"I'm a president and prisoner of war,\" he shouted towards the man in the audience in Spanish. The man was then escorted out of the room in tears.The proceedings were emotional for others in the court as well. Maibort Petit, a reporter from Venezuela who has covered Maduro's administration, said the US missile strikes during Maduro's arrest damaged her family home near Fuerte Tiuna in Caracas.She said it was surreal to watch her former leader escorted into court in prison garb by US marshals. Maduro's wife, Flores, was much quieter, with bandages near her eyes and forehead for injuries her lawyers said she sustained during their weekend arrest. She spoke softly with her blonde hair tied back in a bun while her lawyers asked that she be given proper medical treatment, including an xray of potentially bruised ribs and a fracture.  Maduro and his wife did not seek bail during the proceedings, but can do so at a later date, meaning they will remain in federal custody. The US has accused Maduro of narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Maduro was charged alongside his wife, son and several others. The next court hearing in the case has been scheduled for 17 March.",

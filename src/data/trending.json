    "body": "Allen up against it & more drama in Chicago - NFL play-off predictionsMedia caption, Enter The Top SeedsByPaul HighamBBC Sport JournalistWe move a step closer to Super Bowl 60 with four Divisional Round games coming up - and if this week brings anything like the drama from Wildcard Weekend, it will be quite the treat.The battle for the Lombardi Trophy is as wide open as it has been in years, and nobody would be surprised by any of the remaining eight sides going on to taste glory in Santa Clara next month.But who will emerge victorious this weekend as the number one seeds enter the fray?We have our panel of experts to try to pick the winners, including Radio 5 Live's Rob Staton, BBC Sport journalist Paul Higham and our special guest, former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan.You can also pick your winners below.Divisional Round ScheduleAll times GMT and AFC/NFC seedings in bracketsSaturday, 17 JanuaryBuffalo Bills (6) @ Denver Broncos (1) - 21:30San Francisco 49ers (6) @ Seattle Seahawks (1) - 01:00 (Sunday)Sunday, 18 JanuaryHouston Texans (5) @ New England Patriots (2) - 20:00Los Angeles Rams (5) @ Chicago Bears (2) - 23:30Buffalo Bills @ Denver BroncosMedia caption, Former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan shows his game-worn Broncos helmet.Rob Staton: BillsI've just got a sense that Josh Allen might will his team to victory again. This is his big opportunity this season so can he take advantage?Phil McGeoghan: BroncosMy wife's from Buffalo and we met when I was coaching for the Buffalo Bills, but I've spent most of my career in Bronco land. So I'm not going to say it out loud. She gets a little fired up, but that's who we're going for in this house (Broncos), but that's only in the basement. So I'm subterranean Phil. I can't wait to see what happens, but I'm going to be doing it well below ground, cheering as quietly as possible for the Denver Broncos.Mike White: BroncosThe way this season has unfolded it seems like the door has been left wide open on the AFC side for Josh Allen and the Bills to finally end their wait not only for a return to the big game but also for their first Lombardi success.However, I'm finding it hard to look past the Broncos who had the advantage of the bye week, have a dominant defence, know about winning games in comeback mode and aren't banged up the way Buffalo are - especially at the wide receiver position. I'll take Denver to progress but in a close one by three points or less.Paul Higham: BroncosDenver won the last Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium (the venue for Super Bowl 60 next month) a decade ago, which was also their last play-off win - while it's the only stadium in the league Josh Allen has yet to play in, so there's a hint of destiny about both sides.Allen got his first road play-off win last week, Buffalo's first since 1993, but he got beat up in Jacksonville, has a depleted bunch of receivers, and if James Cook again struggles against Denver's rush defence even Superman himself may just have too much to overcome by himself.And ironically it could be the legs of Bo Nix that do more damage, as Buffalo gave up the most yards per carry to opposing quarterbacks this season. It'll be close but Denver went 11-2 in one-score games this season.San Francisco 49ers @ Seattle SeahawksImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sam Darnold and Brock Purdy will renew their rivalry in SeattleRob Staton: SeahawksYou've got to give Kyle Shanahan and his team a tonne of credit for what they've achieved amid an injury crisis, but realistically this might be a game too far.Mike White: SeahawksThis feels like a game too far for the Niners against a highly talented Seattle who boast a stingy defence whilst San Fran are battered, bruised and without big-name, big-game players such as George Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner.Sam Darnold has an injury designation going into this but is expected to play. Once upon a time, that would've been a boost for any of Seattle's opponents, but the post-New York Jets Darnold is a different proposition and the one-time former 49ers backup will lead them to the NFC title game. Seahawks by 10.Phil McGeoghan: NinersVery interesting game. The 49ers are decimated by injuries, but the best predictor of future events is past events. They've found a way to overcome injuries for quite some time so that means culture has now taken over and it's a winning culture. You don't forget how to win.Paul Higham: SeahawksSam Darnold led the league in turnovers and has an injury, so Seattle will hope to win this with their improving ground game, which averaged 140 yards a game over the last eight weeks, against San Francisco's ailing rush defence heading in the opposite direction.The pass rush is another decider - the Niners ranked last in sacks and second-last in quarterback pressures as their pass rush unit is basically all out injured. Seattle, meanwhile, get consistent pressure and dominated two weeks ago having upped their blitz rate.Throw in the famous Seahawks 12s and a flight back across the country for the 49ers from Philadelphia on a short week and there's just too much in the home side's favour.Houston Texans @ New England PatriotsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Can the Houston Texans defence be good enough to win the Super Bowl?Rob Staton: PatriotsThe Texans' defence is legit and can win them any game, but Drake Maye's mobility and playmaking is the perfect counter. Pats get it done.Phil McGeoghan: PatriotsThe Texans have changed games, ruined games, so you must have a protection plan for the Houston Texans. They will ruin your weekend. In my mind, though, just looking at the way Drake Maye is playing at this particular point and the way that they're just kind of moving, I think it's the Patriots, right?I am from Boston. So I think if I go home and I don't say the Patriots, I might be in the 'harbour' or something. So I will say I think it's going to be the Patriots.Mike White: PatriotsThis is likely to be a tight affair with very few points in the game. The Patriots offence matching up against that forceful Texans defence feels like the match-up to keep an eye on. And with CJ Stroud set to be without his best receiving option in Nico Collins (concussion), Houston's chances just reduced considerably.Mike Vrabel's already a strong coach of the season candidate, and returning the Patriots back to their once-familiar surroundings of the AFC Championship game will only enhance those credentials. Pats take it by six.Paul Higham: TexansHouston's first road play-off win last week was a statement win for this terrifying defence, but the Pats have won a league-leading eight straight Divisional games.Drake Maye's mobility can slow Houston down but I just can't see him doing enough to keep them off his case enough throughout the game. As long as CJ Stroud cleans things up and doesn't have another five fumbles, I'm backing the Texans to make their first AFC Championship game.Los Angeles Rams @ Chicago BearsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Matthew Stafford is the only quarterback still in the play-offs to have been to the Super BowlRob Staton: BearsThere's just a bit of magic about the Bears at the moment and the Rams have not played their best football in weeks. Soldier Field will be rocking and I think Chicago make it to the NFC Championship.Mike White: RamsThe Chicago Bears' renaissance has been nothing short of remarkable and Ben Johnson deserves a tonne of credit for it. As does Caleb Williams who's defied a lot of the (justified) rookie season critics in his second year.That said, this is a Rams team that many have been crowning as the champions-elect for weeks and not without good reason. Whether it's offensive guru Sean McVay, the experience and MVP qualities of Matthew Stafford or the magic hands of Puka Nacua, they have all the ingredients for another Super Bowl run. The predicted Arctic conditions might be somewhat of a leveller but still taking the Rams by four.Phil McGeoghan: Rams I am such a fan of Sean McVay. His mind, the way it works, his gameplans, also his humour. His willingness to be open. All these things matter in football.Because of his personality and how he is with the players, he admires his guys. He doesn't pretend Davante Adams isn't one of the best to ever do it. He doesn't pretend he's not in awe of Matthew Stafford when he makes one of his no-look throws. That stuff really builds culture.That's why they've won Super Bowls, that's why people don't leave there unless they get promoted and get better jobs, because McVay is such a good man and he's a brilliant, brilliant offensive mind so I'm picking Sean McVay and the Rams for those reasons.Paul Higham: BearsOnly four quarterbacks have thrown for 140-plus yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a play-off win in the past 20 years - and two of them collide at Soldier Field.So this genuinely could be decided by whether Matthew Stafford or Caleb Williams, who have combined for 29 fourth-quarter touchdowns this season, has the ball last after both earned thrilling late wins last week.Williams has been doing it all season though, and watching last week even when they were well behind it seemed inevitable the Bears would come roaring back to win. It just gives you a funny feeling that they've got something special rolling in the Windy City.Select your winners from the four Divisional Round games below...",

Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Four people have been taken to hospital and several people have been arrested after a protest outside the Iranian embassy in London. One protester climbed across balconies onto the embassy roof removing a flag on Friday night before being detained, said police.It added police officers had been injured after missiles were thrown at them, although the ambulance service has not said whether it was police or protesters who were taken to hospital.Demonstrations have been taking place outside the embassy after widespread anti-government protests in Iran, where more than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a US-based human rights group.The man who removed a flag from the embassy's roof was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, trespass on diplomatic property and assaulting police, the Metropolitan Police said.It added \"a number\" of people had also been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and a section 35 dispersal order had been imposed outside the embassy \"as a result of ongoing  disorder\".\"A significant police presence remains in place, including additional officers who have been deployed during the evening to prevent further disorder.\"A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said it was called at 20:45 GMT \"to reports of an incident at the junction of Exhibition Road and Kensington Road\".Four people had been taken to hospital while two others were treated at the scene, it said.Earlier this week the Iranian ambassador in London was summoned to the Foreign Office after the killings of protesters in Iran. Last Saturday, two people were arrested at a protest outside the embassy where a protester also climbed onto the building's balcony and appeared to tear down the Iranian flag. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandOttilie MitchellConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted Britain is not broken after her former minister Robert Jenrick criticised the party for failing to campaign on that line.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, she said: \"Ours is still one of the most successful, resilient and influential countries on Earth,\" adding that telling voters their \"country is finished\" only \"drags them down\".She also insisted that the Conservatives were stronger after Jenrick was sacked, ahead of his defection to Reform.In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Friday, Jenrick said a shadow cabinet meeting where colleagues failed to agree that the country was broken had been the final straw for him.In her editorial, Badenoch said there were problems in the UK, some of which were getting worse, but that the country's best days lay ahead.She insisted the Conservatives were best placed to offer solutions to the country's problems, saying that Reform were destined to fail as they welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" the opposition leader wrote.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice praised Jenrick as \"the only cabinet minister who resigned on a matter of principle from the Conservative government\". This was in reference to Jenrick's decision to resign from Rishi Sunak's government, saying it was not going far enough to find a solution to fast-rising immigration levels.Tice continued: \"That makes him uniquely qualified to actually to explain where things went so badly wrong on both legal and illegal immigration, which is to the fury of tens of millions of British people.\"Badenoch said that Jenrick's defection \"was never about principle, it was about ambition\" and \"every criticism he now makes occurred when he was in government\".The Conservative party are now a \"stronger and more united team\", she wrote. Badenoch hopes her sacking of Jenrick will strengthen her position as Tory leader and make her look decisive.But Reform UK now has a new, prominent MP who is intent on publicising what he sees are the many mistakes of his former party.",

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.The force said emergency services had attempted to retrieve the body, which was found among the rocks on the beach at Withernsea on Thursday at 08:30 GMT, but was unsuccessful due to tide times and other conditions.Specialist officers have been in contact with Grace Keeling's family and have asked people to \"refrain from speculation\" and \"respect their privacy\".Police said emergency services, including HM Coastguard, had cordoned off an area of Holmpton Road and remained at the scene.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"Officers and specialist teams have been working to explore every possible option in very complex circumstances to delicately recover the body.\"Due to tide times, conditions and the location, the recovery could not be immediately carried out and has therefore been paused until it is safe to resume.\"Darrin StevensA major search operation was launched on 2 January following reports of people in the waterA major operation was launched involving HM Coastguard, lifeboats and helicopters after calls to the emergency services at about 15:00 GMT on 2 January.Police have previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace Keeling and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".Ratcliffe was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. Sarah Keeling's body was recovered later the same evening.In a tribute, Ratcliffe's family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".Joanne Gee, a close friend of Sarah Keeling, said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".Family HandoutMark Ratcliffe was described by his family as a \"selfless hero\"Humberside Police said no formal identification of the body had taken place but recognised the discovery had followed 13 days of \"extensive searches\" for Grace Keeling.Vickers added: \"I appreciate this update will understandably cause concern to members of the public.\"We have a dedicated team of specialists who are doing everything they can in their efforts to carry out the recovery as safely and as quickly as possible.\"Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaAn inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January.The hearing was told that the results of a preliminary post mortem examination found Sarah Keeling died from drowning and head and neck injuries.She came from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire and worked in sales.Ratcliffe, who was a retired warehouse worker and lived in Withernsea, died from drowning and chest injuries.

    "body": "Justice Secretary David Lammy has blocked the transfer of a killer to an open prison after it emerged he had released drill music with lyrics referencing the murder, under a pseudonym.Jake Fahri was sentenced to life in 2009 for killing16-year-old Jimmy Mizen by throwing an oven dish at him that shattered and severed the arteries in his neck.He was released on licence in 2023 but was later recalled after the Sun published a story alleging Fahri was making music - including about the murder - as balaclava-clad artist Ten.Two years on, the Parole Board said he should be moved to an open prison - but a Ministry of Justice spokesman said Lammy's intervention was for \"public protection\". In its decision summary earlier this month, the board had said Farhi had initially disputed that the music was \"about his own life\" but after being recalled to prison, he accepted that he was the artist Ten.It added that Farhi \"needed to reflect\" on \"why he failed to be open and honest with the professionals managing his case\" but this \"could be achieved\" in an open prison.Deputy Prime Minister Lammy's reversal has been welcomed by Mizen's mother Margaret, who told the Sun she was \"shocked\" by the Parole Board's initial recommendation.\"I would much prefer this decision didn't have to be made because he would have turned his life around. I'm really sad that he hasn't,\" she said.But the reversal shows Farhi, now 36, had \"not changed his attitude\".\"He got into the witness box at his trial and lied through his teeth. Clearly, he hasn't changed, and I'm glad the justice secretary has seen through it.\"Farhi had been given a minimum 14-year prison term - but, as with all minimum terms, that is the point at which release can be considered, usually with conditions attached about the criminal's behaviour outside prison.Music by Ten was showcased on BBC 1Xtra. who were unaware of his real identity at the time of broadcast.

    "body": "2 hours agoBBCThe i Paper's headline dubs sacked former Conservative shadow minister Robert Jenrick \"spy Jenrick\" with a story suggesting he will take\"Tory secrets to Farage\". But his defection to Reform UK and the i's prediction of a \"plum job\" will kick-start a \"new power struggle\" in Reform, it writes.In an editorial for the Telegraph, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch writes \"Britain is not broken\". The \"rebuke\" following Jenrick's defection sets out \"the dividing lines between the Conservatives and Reform\" arguing the country's \"best days are ahead\". Polling by the paper after the 10 cancelled council elections suggests \"Labour would face wipeout\" if they went ahead.Given Badenoch's words in the Telegraph, it seems a bit of a handbrake turn to see her and Jenrick pictured either side of the Daily Express's headline \"We will fix broken Britain... but not together\". The paper promises an exclusive on its inside pages on what the pair \"have to say about their political split\". Defence Secretary John Healey's words \"Farage can't be trusted with Britain\" lead the Daily Mirror. His comments come after Farage said he wouldn't vote for a peacekeeping force in Ukraine.But the Times says Labour has its own internal problems, with its lead suggesting, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is \"under pressure to get rid of Streeting\", according to the Times. Three cabinet ministers have \"hit out after 'toxic' row\", privately accusing Health Secretary Wes Streeting of putting his ambitions for leadership ahead of the party.The Daily Mail leads with the employment tribunal ruling that a hospital \"violated the dignity\" of a group of female nurses who complained about a transgender woman using their changing room. The nurses have now urged ministers to \"protect all women\" and stop \"dragging their heels\" over national guidance on same-sex spaces.\"Back my Greenland plans or face tariffs\" headlines the Guardian after US president Donald Trump said he may impose the fees on countries that don't \"go along\" with his plan. The story is twinned with a trail for an inside feature on \"The rise of JD Vance\".The Daily Star leads with a picture of Trump holding up this year's Nobel peace prize, after Venezuelan winner Marina Machado gifted it to him. The paper dubs it an \"ig-nobel peace prize\" and writes \"it's not yours.. put it down\".The lead for the Financial Times is the EU's \"proposal to tear up membership rules\" as it \"eyes two-tier accession for Kyiv\". This model could fast-track Ukraine's entry into the bloc should a peace deal over Russia's invasion come into place, it writes. Also on the FT's front is home news with the headline \"NHS waiting lists shrink during young doctors' strike as consultants jump in\".Following the retirement of the West Midlands Police chief over his decision to ban Israeli fans from a match against Aston Villa, the Independent asks \"why didn't they fire him?\" Craig Guildford faced \"major criticism\" and \"lost the confidence of the home secretary\" after providing incorrect evidence to MPs on the report that led to  the ban.England footballer Marcus Rashford was \"duped\" into posing with the killer of Jimmy Mizen, the Sun writes. Now Jake Fahri's move to an open jail has been blocked and the paper says that was because of his \"lies to a probation panel\".Robert Jenrick's defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK is still being chewed over across many pages. The Daily Telegraph says the Tory party leader, Kemi Badenoch, has dismissed claims made by Jenrick that Britain is broken. She has written in the paper that the country's \"best days are ahead\". She is also quoted in the Times as saying it is \"extraordinary\" that Mr Jenrick attended this week's shadow cabinet meeting as he was \"plotting\". The Sun sums up Badenoch's thoughts with the headline \"good riddance to bad Rob-bish\".The front page of the i Weekend labels Robert Jenrick a \"spy\", due to suggestions he will pass on details of Conservative strategy to his new colleagues. He is also expected to be given \"a plum job\", but there is a warning this could create tension within Reform.Both the Guardian and the FT Weekend say Jenrick's supporters in his Nottinghamshire constituency of Newark feel \"betrayed\" by his decision to switch to Reform. The Daily Express says voters there have told the paper they want the chance to decide for themselves whether he should continue to represent them.According to the Times, the Prime Minister is under pressure to \"get rid\" of the health secretary, Wes Streeting. Ministers have privately accused Streeting of putting his leadership ambitions before the party. One is quoted by the paper as saying Sir Keir Starmer should learn from Kemi Badenoch's pre-emptive strike against Robert Jenrick. A spokesman for Streeting says it is a real shame that so-called \"allies\" of the prime minister are briefing against him yet again.Some of the papers feature reaction to the chief constable of West Midlands Police retiring with immediate effect, after growing criticism of his role in the banning of Israeli football fans from a match in Birmingham. The Sun says there was \"outrage\" at Craig Guildford being allowed to walk away with a full pension instead of being sacked. The Daily Mail's headline is \"shameless to the very end\"; the paper says he is preparing to sue for constructive dismissal.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesThe Trump administration has named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Sir Tony Blair as two of the founding members of its \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also sit on the \"founding executive board\", the White House said in a statement on Friday.Trump will act as chairman of the board, which forms part of his 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction.Also on the founding executive board are Marc Rowan, the head of a private equity firm, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and a US national security adviser, Robert Gabriel.Each member would have a portfolio \"critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success\", the White House statement said.Trump had said on Thursday that the board had been formed, calling it the \"Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place\".Further members of the board would be named in the coming weeks, the White House said.Sir Tony was UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the UK into the Iraq War in 2003. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). In this role, he focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions to move towards a two state-solution.Sir Tony had already been a part of high-level talks about Gaza's future with the US and other parties. In August, he joined a White House meeting with Trump to discuss plans for the territory, which Witkoff described as \"very comprehensive\".In September, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that involving Sir Tony in such talks, given his record on the Iraq War, would \"raise some eyebrows\".But Streeting also noted the former prime minister's role in brokering the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\"If he can bring those considerable skills there, in both diplomacy and state craft,\" Streeting told the BBC, \"that can only be a good thing\".BBC/Monika GhoshFormer UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is a founding member of Trump's \"Board of Peace\"It comes after the announcement of a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control, will head that new committee.The statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza working with the NCAG.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces and the White House statement said that US Major General Jasper Jeffers would head this force to \"establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment\".The White House said that a separate \"Gaza executive board\" was being formed that would help support governance and includes some of the same names as the founding executive board as well as further appointees.The US peace plan came into force in October and has since entered its second phase, but there remains a lack of clarity about the future of Gaza and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.Getty ImagesBulgarian politician Nickolay Mladenov will represent the board \"on-the-ground\" in Gaza, the White House saysUnder phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Earlier this week Witkoff said phase two would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However the ceasefire is fragile, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations.Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian groups during the same period.Humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 hour agoCemlyn DaviesWales political correspondentPA MediaPlaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth is hoping to be Wales' next first ministerPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth says he would prefer to form a minority government than enter a coalition with another party after the Senedd election.His comments came after an opinion poll published earlier this week suggested Plaid was on course to win the Welsh election on 7 May.Previous polls have suggested Plaid and Reform UK are battling to come out on top - but with neither party winning enough seats to be able to pass laws and spending plans without the support of opposition politicians.Polling expert Dr Jac Larner from Cardiff University said the latest poll could see Plaid win 45 seats, which would leave it four seats short of a majority in the new 96-seat parliament.Recent polls have sparked ongoing speculation around how Plaid would govern if they won the election but failed to win more than half the seats.Speaking to the Gwleidydda podcast on BBC's Radio Cymru, ap Iorwerth said it was his party's \"wish\" to form a minority government made up of only Plaid ministers.He said the latest opinion poll \"confirms what I've felt for a while, which is that we can - if we fight an effective election and build trust with people - lead a minority government and do that successfully\".He added that he was \"determined that that minority government would make it clear from the start to whoever else is in that part of the [political] spectrum that we want to work together\".\"We'll look at who we can work with, issue by issue, policy by policy, budget by budget and so on,\" he added.\"I think it could be the beginning of a period of mature cooperation within government.\"Ap Iorwerth's interview with Gwleidydda was part of a series the podcast is doing with prominent figures from all the major parties.Getty ImagesNo party has ever won a majority of the seats in Cardiff BayResponding to ap Iorwerth's comments, Prof Richard Wyn Jones from the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University told the podcast: \"Of course it's easier to say that when the opinion polls suggest at the moment they aren't far from a majority.\"If you've got a small minority, it's much more difficult to run a government.\"He also suggested the comments could be a way to \"avoid questions and accusations\" from the Conservatives and Reform UK that victory for Plaid Cymru at the election would still put Labour in a position of power.What happens if there's no majority?No party has ever won a majority in Cardiff Bay and the upcoming changes to the voting system make it highly unlikely that will change at this election.Labour has won the most seats at every previous Senedd contest, but without a majority it has always had to strike a deal of some kind with an opposition party.At times that has led to formal coalitions. This is where at least one member of an opposition party joins the government's ministerial team - giving their party a voice at the cabinet table in exchange for its continued support.Cardiff Bay has also seen agreements short of a full coalition, with the most recent example being the cooperation deal between Labour and Plaid Cymru between 2021 and 2024.This saw the Welsh Labour government commit to deliver some Plaid Cymru policies, in exchange for Plaid's support when it came to passing the government's annual budget.If his party wins the election, Rhun ap Iorwerth is hoping he can avoid both of the above options and run a minority government, where votes are agreed on a case by case basis.Ultimately what the next first minister decides to do will depend entirely on the makeup of the new Senedd.After all, as former US President Lyndon B. Johnson said: the first rule of politics is to learn how to count.More top stories",

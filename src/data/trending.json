The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

It is the second time the teenager - who cannot be named for legal reasons - has appeared in front of a judge since Aria Thorpe was found dead at a house in Weston-super-Mare on Monday. The defendant, who appeared via video link from youth detention accommodation, spoke only to confirm his name and did not enter a plea.Judge Peter Blair KC set a provisional trial date of 15 June, with proceedings expected to last two weeks. The defendant's father watched the Bristol Crown Court hearing from the public gallery as his 15-year-old son held his head in his hands.The teenager will remain in youth detention accommodation ahead of his next expected appearance in court on 16 March. No application for bail was entered.He previously appeared at Bristol Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, where he was remanded in custody. Family photographAria Thorpe's family said she was \"bubbly\" and loved country musicDozens of bouquets of flowers have been left in tribute to Aria in Lime Close, the residential street where she died.Police said a post-mortem examination had found her preliminary cause of death was a single stab wound.A close family member told BBC News on Tuesday the schoolgirl was \"lively and bubbly\".\"She loved teaching dogs new tricks and adored country music,\" they added. \"Her favourite song was Jolene by Dolly Parton.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "The UK's financial regulator is investigating WH Smith after the retailer uncovered accounting mistakes at its North America business earlier this year.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it was looking at whether WH Smith had broken rules over what information was shared with investors.Belatedly announcing its annual results, the company said it was planning to recover \"overpaid\" bonuses awarded last year to some executives.WH Smith, which has lost its chief executive and seen its shares fall 40% following the accounting blunder, said it had been a difficult end to the year.WH Smith sold off its chain of 480 High Street shops earlier this year, and these stores have been rebranded TG Jones by its new owner.The retained part of the business includes about 1,300 branches in railway stations, airports and other transport sites.Pre-tax profit excluding one-off costs for the slimmed down business was £108m for the year to the end of August, WH Smith said.Forecasts for its profit had been downgraded after it surfaced that WH Smith's business in North America had overstated revenues possibly by as much as £50m.The company delayed reporting its annual results, initially due on 12 November, twice and chief executive Carl Cowling resigned following an independent review into the accounting errors.\"It has been a difficult end to the year for the group. The board and I are acutely aware that we have much to do to rebuild confidence in WH Smith and deliver stronger returns,\" said Andrew Harrison, the company's interim group chief executive.He said the company was \"committed to ensuring that we strengthen our financial controls and governance as we move forward.\"It said it planned to overhaul its stores in 2026 to create \"one-stop-shops\" selling travel essentials, food-to-go and health and beauty products.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter Government data has been stolen in a hack though officials believe the risk to individuals is \"low\", Trade Minister Chris Bryant has said.That data is understood to have been on systems operated on the Home Office's behalf by the Foreign Office, whose staff detected the incident.It is understood a Chinese affiliated group is suspected of being behind the attack.The UK government has not named who it thinks is responsible, with a spokesperson saying it has been \"working to investigate\" the incident.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Bryant said investigations were \"ongoing\", adding that the security gap was \"closed pretty quickly\".\"We think that it is a fairly low-risk that individuals will have been compromised or affected,\" he added.Speaking to Times Radio, he said: \"I'm not able to say whether it is directly related to Chinese operatives, or indeed the Chinese state\".The Sun newspaper has reported that the incident took place in October, with information possibly including visa details targeted. The incident has been referred to the Information Commissioner's Office.UK intelligence agencies have warned about increasing, large-scale espionage from China, using cyber and other means, and targeting commercial and political information.The cyber-agency GCHQ said last year that it was devoting more resources to counter threats from China than any other nation.\"Government facilities are always going to be potentially targeted,\" Bryant said on Friday. \"We are working through the consequences of what this is.\" Confirmation of a hack by a Chinese state group would be awkward for the government ahead of a planned visit to Beijing next year by Sir Keir Starmer, the first by a UK prime minister since 2018.The Labour government has said it is important to engage with China as it cannot be ignored on trade, climate change and other major issues, but face-to-face meetings also provide a forum for robust exchanges about issues affecting UK security.The Chinese government has consistently denied it backs cyber-attacks targeting the UK.Last year, responding to the UK government's National Security Strategy, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in London said \"accusations such as Chinese espionage, cyber-attacks, and transnational repression against the UK are entirely fabricated, malicious slander\".Earlier this month, Sir Keir said UK government policy towards China could not continue to blow \"hot and cold\".Failing to navigate a relationship with China, he said, would be a \"dereliction of duty\" when China is a \"defining force in technology, trade and global governance\".Building a careful relationship would instead bolster the UK's place as a leader on the international stage and help secure UK national interests, Sir Keir said, while still recognising the \"reality\" that China \"poses national security threats\".While it remains unclear how hackers gained access in this instance, Jamie MacColl, a senior research fellow in cyber and tech at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told the BBC government departments often use \"old IT\" systems.Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser to software company ESET, said government departments needed to invest in \"better digital defences\" because \"they will continue to be targeted\".

    "body": "After 17 hours of at times heated debate, EU leaders agreed in the early hours of Friday morning to jointly raise €90bn (£79bn; $105bn) in zero-interest loans to keep Ukraine financially afloat for the next two years. Kyiv had been clear: the money wasn't a nice-to-have; it was a must-have. With the US under Donald Trump no longer looking to provide new direct military aid to Ukraine, the war-torn country has turned to Europe. Without the cash, Volodymyr Zelensky told EU leaders he wouldn't have enough money to pay Ukrainian soldiers or buy the weapons he needed to counter Russian aggression.The now agreed EU loan will be guaranteed by the bloc's common budget. But in a blow to Brussels' desire to demonstrate decisive European unity over Ukraine to EU sceptics in Washington and Moscow, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic only agreed to support the plan -  it required unanimity to be passed - if they were exempt from it individually. Yet another indication of the divisions in Europe over attitudes to Ukraine and to Moscow.Hungary and Slovakia are known to be closer to the Kremlin. This brings them into direct confrontation with EU countries geographically nearer to Russia such as Poland and the Baltic States. They view Ukraine's survival against Russia as existential. If Kyiv were to lose to Moscow on the battlefield because it was cash or weapons-strapped, they believe that would embolden Russia and would be a disaster for European security and stability more broadly.Arriving at the start of Thursday's fraught summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said EU leaders had a clear decision to make: pay money today, he said, or pay in blood tomorrow. He said he wasn't talking about Ukraine. He was talking about Europe.The new EU joint-loan plan for Ukraine replaces a much-debated EU proposal to raise the €90bn using frozen Russian state assets held in the bloc (€210bn euros' worth in total), mostly in Belgium. Kyiv had described that idea as morally justified, considering the billions of dollars' worth of destruction wreaked by Moscow on Ukraine. But a number of EU countries feared legal retribution by Russia. They worried too that the eurozone's international reputation as a safe destination for global assets could be damaged. Brussels said on Friday it was considering using the frozen Russian assets eventually, to repay the EU loan to Ukraine. But that would be something to be worked out in the future - if a peace deal is signed.For now, on top of the new EU loan, it's estimated Ukraine will need another €45bn euros to cover all its costs for 2026/2027.Brussels hopes non-EU allies of Ukraine like the UK, Japan and Canada might pick up some of that tab. Not going bankrupt now also opens the door for Kyiv to receive loans from banks like the IMF.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesRetail sales fell unexpectedly in November as Black Friday discounts failed to boost spending, official figures show.Supermarket sales fell for the fourth month in a row, while discounts at retailers across November did not lift Black Friday spending as much as in recent years, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Sales volumes fell by 0.1% last month, against analysts' expectations of a 0.4% increase. However, sales over recent months have risen thanks to more computers, clothing and furniture purchases.A separate survey released on Friday suggested shoppers have been willing to spend in the lead-up to Christmas, with consumer confidence in December matching a 16-month high.The GfK consumer confidence survey also found households were feeling better about the prospects for their finances in the year ahead than previously, although sentiment remains subdued.Oliver Vernon-Harcourt, head of retail at Deloitte, said the cut in interest rates to 3.75% on Thursday could strengthen shoppers' confidence and \"retailers will hope this can spur a rebound in consumer spending\" during the crucial pre-Christmas trading period.On Thursday, the Bank of England said its survey of businesses had suggested people were \"keenly focused\" on value for money. Companies responding to its survey \"regularly cited \" the Budget as discouraging spending in recent months.AJ Bell head of financial analysis Danni Hewson said speculation about Budget measures was to blame for \"unnerving consumers at the very peak of the festive shopping period.\"\"Shoppers were impacted by all the speculation about potential tax hikes and continued to display an abundance of caution despite Black Friday temptations,\" she said.The boss of outdoors retailer Mountain Warehouse Mark Neale told the BBC's Today programme the Budget speculation had been \"unhelpful\" to the industry, although his company had enjoyed a record sales period.The ONS's survey of households showed 31% of adults said they planned to take advantage of Black Friday deals on offer, but 19% said they planned to buy less than last year.Separately, the ONS announced on Friday that UK government borrowing was higher than expected last month.Borrowing - the difference between public spending and tax income - was £11.7bn in November, whereas analysts had been expecting about £10bn.However, the figure was £1.9bn lower than in the same month last year and was the lowest November borrowing for four years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the fall was mainly due to higher receipts from taxes and National Insurance contributions.Government borrowing for the financial year to November has now reached £132.3bn, which is £10bn ahead of where it was at the same point last year.Part of that is down to the government reversing a decision to restrict winter fuel payments, as well as paying higher salaries in the public sector and inflation-linked benefits.Chief Secretary to the Treasury James Murray said last month's Budget would \"deliver on our pledge to cut debt and borrowing.\" \"£1 in every £10 we spend goes on debt interest - money that could otherwise be invested in public services,\" he said.But shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the government was \"piling up ever higher debt\".\"Having scrapped the two-child benefit cap and abandoned welfare reform, Labour are borrowing more and more to fund irresponsible spending,\" Stride said.Matt Swannell, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club said the government would need to \"deliver a significant slowdown in borrowing over the next few months\" if it is to hit the Office for Budget Responsibility's target of £138.3bn for the current financial year.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAleem Maqbool, Religion editorReutersRichard Moth, newly appointed as Archbishop of Westminster, speaks at a press conference at the Archbishop's House, in LondonThe Vatican has announced that Richard Moth will be the new Archbishop of Westminster, making him the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales.He succeeds Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who has held the role since 2009 and has stepped down aged 80.For the past 10 years Richard Moth has been Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, and before that served as Bishop to the Forces.As Archbishop of Westminster he will become president of the Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and lead an estimated six million Catholics.Cardinal Nichols reached retirement age when he was 75, but was asked to stay on by Pope Francis. In May he took part in the conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV.The search for a replacement for Cardinal Nichols was led by the Apostolic Nuncio, or papal ambassador to the UK, who presented a list of potential candidates to Pope Leo.Earlier this week, Archbishop Moth released a joint statement calling for empathy for \"those who come to this country for their safety\", reminding Catholics that Jesus's family fled to Egypt as refugees.He has been one of the bishops leading the Church's response to social justice issues in the UK, including praising the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap.Archbishop Moth will face the challenge of declining numbers of people attending churches nationally, though there is growth in some churches with immigrant Catholics.In response to the growing use of Christian symbols at, for example, rallies organised by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson, Bishop Moth has talked of his concern.Last weekend, Robinson held an event in London saying he wanted to \"reclaim\" the country's heritage and Christian identity.\"We are concerned about the tensions that are growing in society and the desire by some groups to sow seeds of division within our communities. This does not reflect the spirit or message of Christmas,\" Bishop Moth said in a statement with the Archbishop of Birmingham.The Catholic Church has been heavily involved in providing assistance to those who have suffered in the cost of living crisis.PA MediaCardinal Vincent Nichols is stepping down having held the role since 2009As archbishop, Richard Moth will also lead the Church's constant challenge of dealing with safeguarding issues.In 2020, a wide-ranging inquiry into child sexual abuse found that between 1970 and 2015 the Catholic Church in England and Wales received more than 3,000 complaints of child sexual abuse against more than 900 individuals connected to the Church.In fact, the leadership of Archbishop Moth's predecessor, Cardinal Nichols, was criticised in the inquiry report, which said he cared more about the impact of abuse on the Church's reputation than on the victims.At the time, Cardinal Nichols apologised and said he accepted the report, adding: \"That so many suffered is a terrible shame with which I must live and from which I must learn.\"Cardinal Nichols retires having led the Church in England and Wales for 16 years, during which it faced enormous change.He is the son of two teachers and was born in Crosby. The lifelong Liverpool FC fan took up his first role as a priest in Wigan.In 2010, he welcomed Pope Benedict XVI to England on an official visit.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has suspended the US green card lottery scheme in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University last week in which two people were killed.The suspect, a Portuguese man who was found dead on Thursday, entered the country through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme (DV1) in 2017 and was granted a green card.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she has paused the visa scheme under Trump's direction to \"ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme\".US officials said they believe the suspect, 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente, also killed Portuguese Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro earlier this week.The programme makes up to 50,000 visas available each year through a random selection process among entries from countries with low rates of immigration to the US.Writing on social media, Noem said Trump had previously \"fought to end\" the scheme in 2017 after eight people were killed in a truck-ramming attack in New York City.Uzbekistan national Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamic State supporter who is serving multiple life sentences for the attack, entered the US through the DV1 scheme, according to Noem.Her comments come just hours after Neves Valente was found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, from what police believe is a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Police said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest, following a six-day multi-state manhunt.He was found dead with a satchel and two firearms. Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene of the shooting at Brown University in Providence, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha.Brown University President Christina Paxson said Neves Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to the following spring, and was studying for a PhD in physics.He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said.Officials said they believe Neves Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Both men had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.Officials said the cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.The same car was spotted near the scene of the professor's shooting, which happened just two days later.Authorities have not provided any suspected motive for either of the attacks.Two students were killed and nine others were injured as a gunman burst into Brown University's engineering building on 13 December and opened fire during final exams.They have been identified as Ella Cook, 19, a second-year student from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18, an Uzbek-American who had just started at the university.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesMillions of people will be able to set their own contactless card payment limits or even have no limit at all, a regulator has confirmed.Banks and card providers will be given the power, from March, to set a maximum - or unlimited - single payment amount without the need to enter a four-digit PIN.But they are also being encouraged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to allow cardholders to set their own individual limits, or switch off contactless entirely. Some banks already offer this function.The move comes despite the FCA's own survey showing little appetite among consumers and industry respondents for a change from the current £100 limit on contactless cards.The FCA said it did not expect card providers to make immediate changes to the current limit from March, but they had the flexibility to do so.When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021.While contactless cards currently have a £100 payment limit, anyone using their smartphone to pay can spend any amount without the need for a PIN.In-built security features, such as thumbprints and face ID, provide greater protection.But concerns have been raised about cards becoming more attractive to thieves and fraudsters, when high-value payments can be made with a tap of a card.Various protections are already in place, such as a prompt to enter a PIN after a series of consecutive contactless transactions are made.Consumers would still get their money back if it was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA.\"Contactless is people's favoured way to pay,\" he said.Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Geale said while the system works well, rigid limits could \"slow things down\".\"So what we want to do is give banks and payment firms greater flexibility to set their own approach to contactless payment, where they see low risk of fraud,\" he said.In practice, he said that means banks and payment companies could choose a limit based on their customers.\"But what we're really encouraging is that they'll open up that flexibility for customers to set their own limits,\" he added.Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand allow industry to set contactless card limits.Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.\"Temptation to spend?The FCA's own survey on changing the rules, released during consultation, showed that 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the current limits.Consumers and academics have suggested that the extra convenience of unlimited contactless payment limits could also lead to shoppers spending without thinking.This is said to be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt.Financial abuse charities have also warned that unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor's bank account with no checks or alerts.They also worry it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society, despite notes and coins being a lifeline to many financial abuse survivors whose card transactions are monitored online by their abusers.One policy to help vulnerable customers access cash, as bank branches close, is the development of shared banking hubs.Cash Access UK, the organisation set up to protect access to cash across the UK, announced the official opening of its 200th banking hub in Billericay, Essex, on Friday.

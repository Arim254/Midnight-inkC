    "body": "8 hours agoEmma SimpsonBusiness correspondentBBCRain drifts across the car park of Crawley's sprawling Asda, but the gloom does little to slow the steady stream of shoppers this midweek afternoon. Parents hurry past with school bags and groceries; car boots slam shut as people load up their weekly shops.For Carol Stimpson, who grew up in the area, the Asda is only a ten‑minute walk from her home, and she pops in most days. \"It's my corner shop,\" she says.Joanne Dench, another local, is also shopping in Crawley, and says she visits the town's Asda for its variety. \"They've got a good range of stuff — clothes, all sorts of things... And they have lots of international food, which is lovely because I like trying new things.\"But despite the bustle in this West Sussex Asda, the chain has been losing ground to rivals at an alarming rate.Joanne Dench, shopping in the centre of Crawley, says she enjoys Asda's rangeThe UK's third biggest supermarket had a dreadful Christmas. Two sets of industry data show Asda suffered a big slump in sales while all its main rivals reported an increase.Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel — and that's off the back of a terrible Christmas the year before.\"A mess\" is how William Woods, a food retail analyst from Bernstein Research, describes Asda's situation.The industry data suggests that despite Asda embarking on a turnaround and cutting prices, shoppers are still turning away. Asda's hope is that with time the plan will work out, but the question others are asking is whether this 60-year-old retailer is really able to turn things around?A controversial dealFor decades, Asda had the reputation as Britain's cheapest grocer, a slightly cheeky northern-based business loved by families for its \"everyday low prices.\"A generation grew up with its \"That's Asda Price\" TV commercial, first featured in an advert for the supermarket in 1977, showing shoppers tapping their back pockets signalling they'd saved money at the tills.The business was sold to the US retail giant Walmart in 1999, in what was then the largest foreign takeover in the UK retail sector.But from about 2010, Asda struggled to fend off the growing threat from Aldi and Lidl as Walmart's global priorities focused on its businesses in the US and elsewhere.In 2021 it sold the chain. In the four years leading up to the transaction, Asda paid just over £4bn to Walmart through a series of dividend payments.Asda was bought by two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn.Mohsin and Zuber Issa made their fortune by building a petrol forecourt empire, EG Group. They were hailed as self-made entrepreneurs who would inject fresh thinking.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAsda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to WorldpanelBut the sale was financed by adding billions of pounds worth of debt onto Asda's business — one of the UK's biggest debt-funded takeovers in recent history.It was a controversial deal inked at the end of a Covid boom in groceries, when people were spending much more time at home and less money eating out. But the market soon changed. The war in Ukraine triggered a huge rise in inflation and a new era of rising interest rates, pushing up the cost of Asda's borrowings.Asda's market shareFollowing the takeover, Asda's CEO left, and Mohsin Issa took over the reins.\"His instincts were good, but it needed an experienced figure to guide the business through the very choppy waters,\" says one former Asda executive.The problems grew, compounded by high management turnover and shifting priorities.Store standards fell after cuts in staff hours and shoppers complained about empty shelves, slow restocking, and poor online availability.Lynette from Swindon first started shopping at Asda more than 20 years ago, but says it began to go \"downhill\" really quickly — \"you could see it in the supermarket, half the tills were closed, shelves were empty.\"Once a loyal Asda shopper, she has within the last few years begun using the discounters, Aldi and Lidl for her main shopping.EG GroupFollowing the takeover, Mohsin Issa took over the reinsBehind-the-scenes, Asda was also working through a huge tech overhaul as it moved away from the systems it used under Walmart.This included installing close to 16,500 new checkouts and launching a new groceries app and website — costing hundreds of millions of pounds.By autumn 2024, Mohsin Issa had stood down from his role. TDR also took majority ownership of the business, putting them in the driving seat.Asda's market share stood at 14.3% just before the takeover, according to Worldpanel, at the end of December 2025, it had fallen to 11.4%.Comparing this to the value of the grocery market overall, you end up with a business that is £4.5bn smaller in terms of annual revenue, at today's prices, than it would have been if Asda had maintained this share, according to Worldpanel sales analysis.Grocers have high fixed costs and slim profit margins. If you can grow the amount of stuff you sell, your profits can increase quickly, but the reverse can happen if your volumes decline (you sell fewer products in total) — leading to \"a negative spiral which is really, really difficult to get out of,\" says Bernstein's William Woods.The revival of AsdaAsda is now in the midst of a turnaround plan.But, judging by the industry data, there's been little sign of traction. The question is, does it simply need more time, or will it be unable to win customers back?The company has brought in the man who helped rescue Asda from the brink of collapse some thirty years earlier, to revive its fortunes.Allan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024, then aged 71. His big plan? The revival of Asda Rollback, the price campaign which he deployed, successfully, in the '90s.Getty ImagesAllan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024\"Rollbacks\" are temporary price reductions. This time round, after the Rollback ends, the products are then moved to a new \"Asda Price\" which are \"guaranteed\" to be lower than the original pre-Rollback price.Leighton said his aim was to make Asda 5-10% cheaper than other traditional supermarkets by the end of 2026, and he was prepared to take a big hit on profits, in the short term, to achieve it.One year on from its launch, Asda's pricing has improved. Data provided to the BBC by retail research firm Assosia shows that Asda's prices on more than 30 branded items were mostly cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons based on promotional deals over the festive quarter.The retailer has also regularly come top of a closely watched weekly price survey run by The Grocer magazine. It doesn't include Aldi and Lidl.\"At times in the last year, Asda has certainly been 5% cheaper than all its established rivals,\" says Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer.The trouble is, the price cuts don't appear to have made any difference.\"For shoppers, it's not just about price,\" says Leyland. Customer service, in-store experience and range is also important as well as perception about \"value\" and brand appeal.That sentiment is echoed by Madeline in Crawley. She says she avoids doing her weekly shop at the town's Asda.\"A lot of the shelves are quite empty, and there are always trolleys in the aisles when they're filling up shelves. Sometimes you can't get to where you want to be — it puts you off.\"One key supplier I spoke to said Asda needed to strike a better balance by investing more in stores and availability, and getting a grip on \"the basic fundamentals of retailing\".Asda has put more staff in stores and insists it is making progress.But once you've lost shoppers, it's very hard to win them back, especially when many of your rivals are firing on all cylinders, helped by price matching and loyalty schemes, in an intensely competitive market.William Woods believes Asda should have stuck to its year-long Aldi and Lidl price match campaign, which ended in January 2025. He says price matching has been a \"great psychological mechanism\" for Tesco and Sainsbury's to change customer perception and fight the discounters.Their respective loyalty price schemes, Clubcard and Nectar, also create a \"wow\" factor at the till, Woods says.Asda points out that rebuilding the business is a three to five year journey.\"We are in the early stages of our transformation,\" a spokesperson said. \"This is anchored in offering an unmatched value proposition, making sure products are always available and ensuring customers have the best possible experience when visiting our stores or shopping online.\"This approach is beginning to be reflected in stronger volumes over recent periods.\"One person familiar with the situation said there had been signs of a recovery last summer, but that coincided with the final stage of Asda's separation from Walmart's systems. This caused disruption, leading to empty shelves in the all important run up to Christmas trading, a \"nightmare\" putting the turnaround six months behind schedule, they said.\"It's annoying, disappointing, but we had to get out of the Walmart system,\".Does Asda have the firepower?In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data.Many in the industry are wondering if it has the necessary firepower to regain all the lost ground. Even if it can fix the basics, will Asda's high levels of debt prevent a full recovery?It sold off a raft of stores and a distribution centre – and then rented them back – to help reduce its borrowings. At the end of December 2024, its net debt stood at £3.8bn, whilst the annual financing costs, including debt interest payments, increased 38% to £611m.\"It's an amazing brand….  but sadly, I believe the business is totally broken,\" the former Asda executive believes.\"Whoever the owner is, I just don't think the business can stomach, or the balance sheet can't stomach, the level of investment that is required. The lack of investment goes back 10-15 years,\" they claimed.Getty ImagesIn December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales dataAn Asda spokesperson said its \"strong balance sheet and underlying free cash flow generation\" means it can comfortably cover current and future debt obligations.Like Asda, Morrisons has also been struggling under new private equity owners and has been selling assets to reduce its debt pile. It has lost all important market share and the number four spot to Aldi but its performance has recently stabilised.According to the major supplier, both businesses are in a race to get out of the debt burden, which is holding them back.\"I would love for them [Asda] to get back to where they were. Whether it's feasible is another question...\" the supplier says.Ged Futter spent fifteen years working as a buyer for Asda. He now runs a business training suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets and fears his former employer is in \"real trouble\".\"I was with a client today who said Asda was asking for this investment for promotions. The client said I'm walking away. What they asked for is too much. I'm backing another horse.\"2026: Make or breakThis year there's also been a further fall in the price of Asda's traded debt — a sign that investors are getting more nervous about the viability of the turnaround.The person familiar with the workings of Asda says they believe it has a compelling offer with its in store pharmacies and opticians, as well as the George clothing brand and a general merchandise business that is healthy.The view among many observers I've spoken to is that some form of consolidation in the sector seems, at some point,  inevitable — whether that means supermarkets breaking up, being sold, or merging.Allan Leighton has compared his task to climbing Mount Everest. Certainly, winning back customers will be no mean feat.Swindon local Lynette says: \"I don't think I will ever go back to shopping at Asda again, I might pick up the odd thing there, but they've lost me as a loyal customer.\"Asda badly needs some momentum, and 2026 feels make or break for the turnaround.Top image credit: Getty ImagesMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesCynthia Erivo, Sabrina Carpenter and Lady Gaga all have multiple Grammy nominations this yearAt the ripe old age of 67, the Grammy Awards are still considered \"music's biggest night\". This year's ceremony takes place in LA on Sunday, with everyone from Harry Styles to Chaka Khan due to attend.Kendrick Lamar tops the nominations with nine nods, most of them for his sixth album, GNX. He was the main winner at last year's ceremony, too, winning both record and song of the year for his scorching diss track, Not Like Us.Other contenders include Lady Gaga, with seven nominations, along with Bad Bunny, Sabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas, who have six each.In total, there are 95 awards, distributed over a mind-boggling eight hours. Alongside banner categories like album of the year, we'll find out who had the best album artwork, and who's made the best \"ambient, new age or chant\" album.Here's everything you need to know ahead of the ceremony.1) Who's going to win album of the year?Getty ImagesBad Bunny could be the first person to win the night's main prize with an album sung entirely in SpanishMost insiders agree that there's a three-way race for the night's biggest prize - with Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar and Lady Gaga the presumed favourites.None of them have ever won before, despite multiple nominations, and there are good reasons to think they're the front-runners.Gaga is a Grammy darling, with 14 wins from 45 nominations. Her seventh album, Mayhem, is a triumphant return to the maximalist pop that made her famous, delivered with the hard-won grace of someone who's endured 18 years in the pop machine. Like Beyoncé last year, voters might feel she's put in the work to earn the top title.Lamar is in a similar position. He's the only artist with album of the year nominations for five consecutive releases, and GNX is a snappy, crowd-pleasing tour de force.Giving him the prize would also go some way to correcting the Grammys' rap problem. The last time a hip-hop album won album of the year was in 2004.But Bad Bunny is the presumptive front-runner. The Puerto Rican star's musically ambitious Debí Tirar Más Fotos, fuses live instrumentation with the hip-swaying pulse of reggaeton, plena, salsa and a multitude of other Latin styles.A win for Bad Bunny would mark the first win for a Spanish language album.That said, the Grammys have a habit of making spectacularly weird decisions, so don't discount the chances of Justin Bieber or Sabrina Carpenter lifting the trophy.Notably, no matter who wins album of the year, it will be their first victory in the category.2) Will there be justice for Milli Vanilli?!Getty ImagesRob Pilatus (left) and Fab Morvan won best new artist in 1990 - but they didn't get to keep the trophies for longPop duo Milli Vanilli were stripped of their Grammy Award for best new artist in 1990, when it was discovered that the members, Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus, had been miming to someone else's vocals.Thirty-six years later, Morvan is nominated for best audiobook for his memoir You Know It's True: The Real Story of Milli Vanilli.It's an eye-opening and harrowing story that lays bare what fame demands of you, and how Morvan struggled to rebuild his life after becoming one of music's biggest punchlines.If he wins, it could be an emotional moment of redemption.3) Can Olivia Dean win best new artist?Olivia Dean was one of the biggest break-out stars of last yearThe British star is certainly a front-runner. Her joyful, old-school pop songs were deservedly massive last year, pairing classic songcraft with an unabashedly romantic outlook.Her album, The Art Of Loving, had a golden streak in December, just as voters were filling in their ballots, boosting her odds of victory.It came out too late to be shortlisted for album of the year, though. She'll have to wait 12 months for that one.Dean faces strong competition from fellow Brit Lola Young, whose cathartically confrontational single Messy was a breakout hit last year.R&B artist Leon Thomas could also sneak off with the trophy. A former writer for Ariana Grande, SZA and Post Malone, he's the only best new artist nominee to pick up an album of the year nod, which suggests he's popular with voters.The rest of the pack includes influencer-turned-pop star Addison Rae, influencer-turned-pop star Alex Warren, frenetic girl group Katseye, chiselled rock star Sombr and LA indie outfit The Marías.For the second year in a row, all eight new artist nominees will perform during a special segment on Sunday night.4) What about the other big prizes?Getty ImagesAfter performing at last year's Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar and SZA are hot favourites to win record of the year for their loved-up duet, LutherOne of the year's most fiercely-contested categories is record of the year - better understood as \"best single\".That's where you'll find Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild butting heads with Lady Gaga's Abracadabra and Chappell Roan's The Subway.But none of them really captured the public imagination in the same way as Rosé and Bruno Mars's APT. A honking great crossover hit, it has exactly the sort of cross-generational appeal the Grammys loves.The only serious competition is Kendrick and SZA's Luther, a sumptuous rap ballad that spent 13 weeks at number one in America last year.If APT wins, it'll be a record-breaker twice over. Rosé will become the first K-pop artist to win a Grammy; and Mars will become the only artist to win record of the year four times. (Right now, he's tied with Paul Simon on three.)The song of the year award - which recognises the songwriters - has almost exactly the same shortlist, with the addition of Golden, from the movie K-Pop Demon Hunters.The prominent use of samples and interpolations in Luther and APT could put them at a disadvantage here; which is good news for Carpenter's Manchild - whose country-pop hybrid appeals to a broad cross-section of voters.Bad Bunny could also win here for DTMF (I should have taken more photos), a gorgeous rumination on the passage of time that segues into a lively celebration of life.5) Is there a list of Grammy performers?Getty ImagesJustin Bieber will take to the stage ahead of his headline slot at this year's Coachella Music FestivalHeck, yeah. And what a list...Justin BieberSabrina CarpenterClipse & Pharrell WilliamsOlivia DeanKatseyeLady GagaLauryn Hill (Tribute to D'Angelo & Roberta Flack)Reba McIntyre with Brandy Clark and Luka NelsonThe MaríasBruno MarsPost Malone, Slash, Chad Smith (Tribute to Ozzy Osbourne)Addison RaeRoséSombrTyler, The CreatorLeon ThomasAlex WarrenLola Young6) Will Taylor Swift be performing?ReutersTaylor Swift's Life Of A Showgirl album was released after the eligibility period for this year's Grammy AwardsNot on your nelly.Rumours that Taylor Swift would turn up and tinkle the ivories were shot down by Grammy producer Ben Winston.Asked about the speculation by the showbiz website Hits Daily Double, he pointed out that the source of the story was... er, the showbiz website Hits Daily Double.\"The only reason people think Taylor might be performing or coming is because Hits decided to print it this week and it was picked up globally,\" he said.\"But Hits just totally made that up. And now I am getting asked about it by you, as if it's a real thing, when it was made up in your office!\"Also not performing: Bad Bunny. His gig headlining the Super Bowl half time show next month means he's unable to take the stage at the Grammys.7) Is it finally time for a K-pop Grammy?Getty ImagesRosé could be the first K-Pop star to win a Grammy on SundayRight now, no K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy - although BTS have received multiple nominations and even performed at the ceremony.That could change on Sunday. Rosé, one quarter of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, is nominated for three awards for APT, her irresistible, cheerleader chanting duet with Bruno Mars. In the song of the year, she goes head-to-head with the fictional girl group Huntr/x, who appear in the hit animation K-Pop Demon Hunters.And Katseye, a global girl group trained under the arduous K-pop system, are also up for best group and best pop group performance, for their single Gabriela.They might not win, but there's a growing recognition that K-pop has become a cultural and commercial force. For Audrey Nuna, one of the singers behind Huntr/x, getting to perform at the show represents a huge step forward.\"You're going to see three Korean faces,\" she told E! News. \"To think about the kids who are going to see that, and hopefully for that to shape their understanding of what they can do in this world, is the stuff that is giving me chills up my spine.\"In an interview earlier this week, the Recording Academy CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, confirmed there was a \"groundswell\" amongst voters for a separate K-pop category. Could it be created just in time for BTS's comeback? Watch this space.8) Any other notable nominees and surprises?EPAThe Dalai Lama is up for his first ever GrammyBarbra Streisand could correct a historic wrong on Sunday night. Her duets album, The Secret of Life, is nominated for best traditional pop album - a category she has lost 13 times since it was introduced in 1992.Her chances look slim, though, with stronger albums by Lady Gaga, Elton John & Brandi Carlile, and Icelandic jazz singer Laufey all in the running.Festival headliners and generally excellent people Haim could become the first ever all-female band to win best rock album.\"We really set out to make a rock album this time, so it's a huge milestone,\" Alana Haim told the BBC after their nomination. \"But we're just grateful for the women that came before us.\"Elsewhere, the Dalai Lama is nominated for best audio book, for Meditations: The Reflections Of His Holiness The Dalai Lama. It's the first time a Dalai Lama has received a Grammy nomination.And we could end the night with the youngest-ever Grammy winner. Eight year old Aura V is nominated for best children's album for Harmony, a bubbly, life-affirming record she made with her dad, Harold Simmons II. 9) Will artists address the political situation in the US?ReutersBillie Eilish has been a vocal critic of the actions of Immigration enforcement officers in the USIn the week that Bruce Springsteen released a song denouncing \"King Trump\" and \"federal thugs\" in Minneapolis, it seems impossible that politics won't feature on the Grammys stage.Billie Eilish, nominated for record and song of the year, has called on her fellow musicians to \"speak up\" about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, whose actions have resulted in the death of two protestors. Bad Bunny didn't need prompting. He previously called ICE agents \"sons of bitches\" who won't leave \"people alone and working\". President Trump has defended the immigration operation in Minnesota, saying it took \"thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state. On Wednesday, however, he said his administration would \"de-escalate a little bit\", amid rising tensions.Grammys boss Harvey Mason Jr said it was inevitable that emotions would spill onto the stage this Sunday.\"You're going to hear and feel what's going on in the world through the music,\" he  told CNN. \"Maybe some people will choose to speak out about it, but you're definitely going to feel it in the music, in the performance, in the passion that goes into the art.\"10) Who votes for the Grammys?Getty ImagesWinners all receive a golden gramophone trophyThis year, about 15,000 people were eligible to vote for the Grammys - including musicians, producers, lyricists, and even the people who write album liner notes.To qualify, they must be currently working in the music industry, and pay an annual subscription of $150 (£120) to the Recording Academy. All former winners are also eligible to vote.Every member is allowed to vote in up to 10 categories across three fields, such as rock, classical and R&B. They are encouraged only to vote in genres where their expertise lies.Additionally, every member, regardless of their background, gets to vote for the six biggest awards of the night. Those are: Album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, best new artist, songwriter of the year and producer of the year.The 2026 awards recognise music released between 31 August, 2024 and 30 August, 2025. More than 20,000 records were submitted for consideration this year. The winners will not be revealed until the ceremony.11) How can I watch in the UK?Getty ImagesComedian Trevor Noah is hosting the ceremony for the sixth and final timeThe ceremony is split into two parts, with the first 80 awards distributed during what's called the \"premiere ceremony\" at 12:30 in Los Angeles / 20:30 in London on Sunday.It's often worth tuning in. The winners in the more obscure categories are less polished and more excited about winning, and the performances are looser and, dare I say it, more musical than the grandiose set pieces you'll see later.It's also the place to see British stars like Wet Leg, Yungblud, FKA Twigs and Sleep Token find out whether they've won in the rock and dance categories.That's also where you want to go to watch red carpet coverage, which kicks off at 15:00 in Los Angeles / 23:00 in the UK.Finally, the main show kicks off at 17:00 Los Angeles / 01:00 Monday in the UK. It's broadcast live in the US on CBS and streaming platform Paramount Plus. At present, there is no way to watch in the UK without circumventing geographical streaming restrictions, but clips from the ceremony appear on social media with incredible speed.Full speeches and select performances are usually uploaded to YouTube the following day.",

On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "10 hours agoMadeline HalpertColumbia Heights Public SchoolsA US judge has ordered the release of a five-year-old boy and his father from an immigration detention centre in Texas, condemning it as driven by a \"perfidious lust for unbridled power\".The detention of Liam Conejo Ramos, photographed wearing a blue bunny-shaped hat and a Spider-Man backpack, sparked national outcry after he was taken into custody on the driveway of his home in Minneapolis.The child's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained.Following the outrage over the pre-schooler's detention, immigration officials said they did not \"target a child\" but were conducting an operation against his father, an \"illegal alien\" who \"abandoned\" his son when approached.On Saturday, US District Judge Fred Biery granted an emergency request from the family's lawyer, ordering government officials to release the father and son by 3 February. The judge also included a photo of Ramos in his fluffy blue hat in his ruling.\"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatising children,\" Biery wrote in his ruling. Biery, an appointee of former US President Bill Clinton, said deportations through the US immigration system should occur in a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place. \"Observing human behaviour confirms that for some among us, the perfidious lust for unbridled power and the imposition of cruelty in its quest know no bounds and are bereft of human decency,\" he wrote of the detention of Ramos. The BBC has contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment. Marc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, said the boy and his father were being held at a detention centre in San Antonio, Texas. Prokosch said Ramos and his father had come to the US in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum and had been following the proper immigration protocols. In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement efforts in Minneapolis in an initiative dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge\".On Thursday, Trump officials suggested they may start pulling back federal forces in the state after a national outcry over the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.In a separate ruling on Saturday, a federal judge denied a state government's request to block the Trump administration's deployment of thousands of immigration agents in Minneapolis, saying the state had not proven the activity was unlawful.

    "body": "12 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesUS Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island with his family, emails show - years after Lutnick claimed to have cut ties with the convicted paedophile.The billionaire businessman, his wife, their four children and another family planned to travel to Little Saint James in 2012, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).The emails contradict statements Lutnick made in October about vowing in 2005 to \"never be in a room\" with Epstein again.A Commerce Department spokesperson said Lutnick had never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein.On Friday, the justice department released millions of pages from Epstein files, the largest number of documents shared by the government since a law mandated their release last year.Several emails show Lutnick and his family planned a visit to Little Saint James - a private island that Epstein purchased in 1998.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant: \"We are looking forward to visiting you. We will be coming from Caneel Bay in the morning. We are a crowd... 2 families each with 4 kids ranging in age from 7-16! 6 boys and 2 girls. I hope that's okay. We would love to join you for lunch.\"In another email, sent to a redacted recipient days before his wife's email, Lutnick writes: \"Hi Jeff, We are landing in St. Thomas early Saturday afternoon and planning to head over to St. Bart's/Anguilla on Monday at some point... Does Sunday evening for dinner sound good?\"Lutnick then asks for specific location details for his boat captain, and mentions that another family is with his family.Other emails were exchanged in December about Howard Lutnick joining Epstein for lunch on the island. On 24 December 2012, Lutnick received an email from a redacted sender that said Epstein wanted to pass a message to him, which said: \"Nice seeing you\" - suggesting that at least one visit did happen.The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing.According to an October 2025 interview with the New York Post, Lutnick said he had cut ties with Epstein in 2005 when the pair were neighbours in New York.Lutnick explained to the newspaper that Epstein had given him and his wife a tour of his Manhattan townhouse, where the late financier showed off his massage room.\"I say to him, 'Massage table in the middle of your house? How often do you have a massage?'\" Lutnick told the Post. \"And he says, 'Every day.' And then he gets, like weirdly close to me, and he says, 'And the right kind of massage'.\"Lutnick told the outlet that, after leaving Epstein's house, \"in the six to eight steps it takes to get from his house to my house, my wife and I decided that I will never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again\".The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Three million pages, 180,000 images and 2,000 videos were posted publicly by the DOJ on Friday.Epstein was convicted in 2008 in Florida for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl after coming to a controversial plea agreement with prosecutors.He died in August 2019 while in jail on charges in a sex trafficking case.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockSome roads in Balochistan's provincial capital Quetta have been sealed offA series of gun and bomb attacks across Pakistan's south-western Balochistan province have killed 18 civilians and 15 security service personnel, the country's military says.Security forces responding to the violence killed at least 92 attackers, the military said. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group had earlier said it was behind the attacks, claiming dozens of soldiers were killed.The escalation is one of the deadliest days of violence in the impoverished province, where Pakistan's government has been battling an ethnic insurgency for decades.Pakistan accused India of supporting the BLA. Delhi has repeatedly denied such accusations.The military said multiple attacks had targeted civilians around the provincial capital Quetta and other locations.Grenade and gun attacks in 12 cities and towns across the province targeted police and paramilitary installations, as well as prisons and government buildings. Some key administrative buildings in Quetta and nearby roads were reported to have been sealed off during the day. Mobile phone services were jammed, and regional train services were suspended.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later praised the military, pledging to \"continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication\".The BLA accuses Pakistan's federal government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of its largest province without the local population benefiting. Local activists also blame Pakistani security forces for enforced disappearances, which Islamabad denies.Balochistan covers nearly 44% of the country's total land, sharing a volatile border with Iran and Afghanistan and covering part of the Arabian Sea coastline. It is home to about 5% of the country's more than 240 million people. The province is also the richest in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals. The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which is the largest ethnic group there. Resistance against the Pakistani government and an insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire.",

    "body": "10 hours agoChi Chi Izundu,Olivia Davies,William DahlgreenandAdam WalkerPA MediaA second woman is alleging that she was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, her lawyer has told the BBC.The encounter allegedly occurred at the former prince's residence, Royal Lodge, in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.The woman's lawyer, Brad Edwards from the US firm Edwards Henderson, said that after spending the night with Andrew, she says she was also given a tour of Buckingham Palace and tea.\"We're talking about at least one woman who was sent by Jeffrey Epstein over to Prince Andrew. And she even had, after a night with Prince Andrew, a tour of Buckingham Palace,\" the lawyer said.BBC News has asked Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor for comment, but so far he has not responded to these accusations.Buckingham Palace routinely records the names of tour guests but it has not been possible for the BBC to corroborate the woman's visit without revealing her identity.The woman's account of spending the night at Andrew's home is the first time an Epstein survivor has alleged a sexual encounter occurred at a royal residence.Edwards represents more than 200 Epstein survivors worldwide, and represented Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that she was brought to London to have sex with the former prince in 2001 when she was 17.Giuffre said she was forced to have sex with Andrew two more times between 2001 and 2002 - once in New York and once on Epstein's private Caribbean island.Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010.LNPAndrew was seen horse riding in Windsor on SaturdayThe lawyer, who is based in Florida, told the BBC that there were communications between his client and the former prince before the encounter where she says she spent the night with him.Edwards said he had been in contact with \"certain legal counsel\" of the former prince in the United States, but said Andrew had \"seemingly been disconnected from his lawyers\".Communications stopped after King Charles formally removed Andrew's \"style, title and honours\", he said. Andrew was stripped of his royal titles in October last year, following the publication of Giuffre's posthumous memoir. It was also announced that he would leave Royal Lodge on the Windsor estate, which had been his home since 2004.In the statement announcing the removal of the former prince's titles, the Palace said: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"Edwards said that stripping Andrew of his titles has allowed the former prince to maintain that he has no money and no ability to provide compensation, and to \"allow these women to just suffer\".Buckingham Palace in October said \"their majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been and will remain with the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse\".The lawyer said he is now considering filing a civil lawsuit on the woman's behalf against the former prince.Virginia Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against Andrew in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.Andrew has always denied Giuffre's claims.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykBBCLord Triesman, former Labour minister and ex-chairman of the Football Association, has died aged 82. Labour figures paid tribute to their colleague, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praising his \"brilliant contribution to our party and country\" and former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair describing him as \"a vital part of the New Labour movement\". Born David Triesman in London, he joined the Blair government as Foreign Office minister in 2004, and sat on several prominent select committees, holding an active role in House of Lords until his death.As FA chair between 2008 and 2010, he campaigned against racism in the sport and was a vocal supporter of women's football. Lord Triesman was the general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, and the general secretary of the Labour Party, before he joined the government as a member of the Lords.When Labour went into opposition in 2010, he became shadow minister for foreign affairs.A passionate Spurs fan, Lord Triesman was the first independent chair of the FA. He stood down from the role - as well as chair of England's 2018 World Cup bid - in May 2010 following a tabloid newspaper sting in which he was recorded accusing rival bidders of bribery. Lord Triesman said the remarks were part of a private conversation and \"never intended to be taken seriously\".He later suggested that football's ruling body Fifa needed a culture change to tackle corruption allegations it faced at the time.In a statement, the Labour Party said Lord Triesman died on Friday night \"peacefully and at home\". The prime minister said on X he was \"saddened\" to hear of the death.Sir Tony said he was \"passionate about the cause, whether the Labour Party or football, he was deeply committed to making change to improve people's lives.\"\"He was a gentle, genuine, good guy who put others before himself naturally and without hesitation,\" he added in a statement.Leader of the House of Lords, Labour peer Baroness Angela Smith said Lord Triesman was \"respected and loved by his colleagues for his courtesy, kindness, wisdom, loyalty and generosity of spirit\".Lord Triesman leaves behind his wife, Lucy, and their daughter, Ilona.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNew pictures of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the latest batch of released documents related to Jeffrey Epstein dominates Sunday's papers. The Sunday Telegraph's front page features a photo of the former prince kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground. The paper also leads on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggesting that Mountbatten-Windsor should testify to US Congress on everything he knows about the Epstein scandal. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to the late sex offender and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The Sunday Times follows with more on the prime minister's reaction to the latest images of the former prince. It says Sir Keir implied that Mountbatten-Windsor would be failing victims if he continues to refuse to testify about his relationship with Epstein. Sir Keir said that \"in terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information,\" adding \"you can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that.\" The paper adds that the the prime minister's comments \"signal a significant increase in political pressure\" on the former prince, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing. \"Creepy crawler\" is the Daily Star's headline as it spotlights the same picture of Mountbatten-Windsor. The paper says the photos \"heap more pressure on disgraced ex-prince\".The Sunday Mirror suggests \"there's worse to come\", quoting a lawyer for victims of Epstein. According to the paper, attorney Spencer Kuvin says: \"There are more photos and videos very likely to be released. They will be more damning.\" There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and the BBC has reached out to Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. The Sun follows with comments from a former royal cop, who calls the new images of Mountbatten-Windsor \"shameful\".The Independent echoes other headlines, saying Mountbatten-Windsor \"faces more Epstein questions\" and is again \"under fire\" over his friendship with the late sex offender. Mountbatten-Windsor has previously said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\" in relation to Epstein.The Mail on Sunday shifts its focus to a potential leadership challenge, reporting that former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has secured a \"war chest\" of more than £1m to fund a bid to succeed Sir Keir Starmer.The UK could be in danger of becoming a \"welfare state attached to a bankrupt country\", the Sunday Express warns. The paper says new research shows that more than six million workers would be better off living on benefits.The Observer's front page previews \"the plot against democracy\" as it reports on the \"campaign to kill off the assisted dying bill\".Many front pages have the photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, clothed, on all fours, over an unidentified woman.Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.\"The plot against democracy,\" is the headline in the Observer, as it accuses the House of Lords of filibustering to slow-talk the assisted dying bill to its doom. Writing in the paper, the TV presenter Esther Rantzen says that on the third anniversary of her terminal cancer diagnosis, all she asks is for future generations to be given the confidence and hope of a fast, pain-free death when they need it most.The Sunday Express reports research by the Conservative think tank, the Centre for Social Justice, which warns that six million workers - or a quarter of the workforce - would be better off on benefits. It says that since the pandemic, claims for mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression, have been rocketing.The Sun quotes the Department for Work and Pensions as saying the report confirms that the vast majority of people are better off in work. In its editorial, the paper says the figures are damning - and accuses the prime minister of burying his head in the sand.The Mail on Sunday claims that the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has raised a war chest of more than £1m to fund a bid to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for Labour leadership. The paper says she has started to promise Cabinet jobs to her supporters, as she set up a new company. In response, Rayner's spokesman said: \"A running commentary is not helpful, and nor is ill-informed gossip or idle speculation.\"The Sunday Telegraph says the King paid a surprise visit to joggers at a Parkrun event on his Sandringham Estate in Norfolk. \"Yes, it really IS His Majesty,\" is the Sunday Mirror's headline, above a photo of the King, laughing beside one of the organisers, who's holding up a sign to that effect. Joggers \"lapped up\" the joke, it says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoMaia DaviesBBCOfficials say a gas leak was the blame for the explosion in Bandar AbbasFive people have been killed in two separate explosions in Iran which local officials and state media say were caused by gas leaks.One person was killed and 14 injured in a blast at a residential building in the southern city of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf coast, a local official told Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency.Another explosion killed four people in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported.It comes as tensions persist in the region after a build-up of US forces in the Gulf and pressure on Tehran to strike a deal on its nuclear programme from President Donald Trump.Speaking to journalists while on his way to Florida on Saturday night, Trump was asked whether he had decided what to do in Iran and said \"I certainly can't tell you that.\" But he added, reiterating comments made to Fox News earlier on Saturday, that Iran was \"seriously\" talking to Washington.He said he hoped they would negotiate something acceptable, and noted that the US has \"very big powerful ships\" in the region.Earlier, in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state TV said an explosion had ripped though an eight-floor building, \"destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops\" in the Moallem Boulevard area.The local fire department chief Mohammad Amin Liaqat said a preliminary assessment showed it had been caused by a gas leak and \"build-up\".\"My colleagues will give more details in the next few hours,\" he said in a video published by Mehr.Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, a regional official, told the news agency that the injured had been taken to hospital.Semi-official news agency Tasnim denied social media reports that a Revolutionary Guards Corps navy commander had been targeted in the blast.Elsewhere, Tehran Times reported a second explosion at a residential building in the Kianshahr neighbourhood of Ahvaz, near the border with Iraq.It reported that emergency officials had rescued a child trapped beneath debris and transferred him for medical treatment.Speaking to Fox News on Saturday, Trump said Iran was \"negotiating\", adding that Washington could not share its plans with its allies in the Gulf.\"We'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there.\"Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian said conflict would not be in the interest of either country nor the broader region.\"The Islamic Republic of Iran has never sought and in no way seeks war,\" he said during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, news agency AFP reported citing a statement from Iran's presidency.Separately, the head of the country's Supreme National Security Council Ali Larijani met the Qatari prime minister in Tehran on Saturday and \"reviewed ongoing efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region\", Qatar's foreign ministry said.Larijani, whom the Kremlin said had also met Russia's President Putin for talks on Friday, wrote on X: \"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.\" Iran's foreign minister has said Tehran is open to talks with the US provided they are based on trust and respect but cautioned that its missile defence system would \"never\" be the subject of negotiation.Trump told Tehran on Wednesday that time was \"running out\" for it to reach a deal on its nuclear programme - which Iran insists is peaceful - and later said they must also \"stop killing protesters\" to avoid military action.It came after he had promised to intervene to help those involved in a brutal crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month, although he later said he had heard on good authority that the execution of demonstrators had stopped.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,300 people since the unrest began in late December, and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths.",

    "body": "16 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersElon Musk - the boss of SpaceX as well as Tesla and X - is the world's richest personElon Musk's SpaceX has applied to launch one million satellites into Earth's orbit to power artificial intelligence (AI).The application claims \"orbital data centres\" are the most cost and energy-efficient way to meet the growing demand for AI computing power.Traditionally, such centres are large warehouses full of powerful computers that process and store data. Musk's aerospace firm claims processing needs due to the expanding use of AI are already outpacing \"terrestrial capabilities\".It would increase the number of SpaceX satellites in orbit drastically. Its existing Starlink network of nearly 10,000 satellites has already been accused of creating congestion in space, which Musk denies.The new network could comprise up to one million solar-powered satellites, according to the application filed on Friday with the US Federal Communications Commission - which does not specify a timeline for the plan.SpaceX claims the system would deliver the computer capacity required to serve \"billions of users globally\".It also says it would be the first step towards \"becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation - one that can harness the Sun's full power\", referencing a scale of hypothetical alien societies proposed by an astronomer in the 1960s.Musk wrote on his social media site X: \"The satellites will actually be so far apart that it will be hard to see from one to another. Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\"Like the Starlink satellites, which provide high-speed internet, they would operate in low-Earth orbit at altitudes ranging between 500-2,000km (310-1,242 miles).SpaceX claims \"orbital data centres\" - a concept also being explored by other firms - would be a greener alternative to traditional centres, which require enormous amounts of power to run and water for cooling.An expert previously told the BBC that launching hardware into orbit remains expensive and that the infrastructure to protect, cool and power them can be complex - while a growing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.Meanwhile, astronomers complained in 2024 that radio waves from the Starlink network were \"blinding\" their telescopes and hindering their research.Musk has previously rejected claims that his satellites were taking up too much room and crowding out competitors.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosAnadolu via Getty ImagesSeveral strikes have been reported across the Strip, including in Khan YounisAt least 32 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by US President Trump last October, came into effect earlier this month.The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said \"eight terrorists were identified exiting the underground terror infrastructure in eastern Rafah\", an area in Gaza where Israeli forces are deployed under the October agreement.The IDF said it had, together with the Israel Security Agency (ISA), struck targets in various locations including \"four commanders and additional terrorists\" as well as a weapons storage facility, a weapons manufacturing site and \"two launch sites belonging to Hamas in the central Gaza Strip\".Hamas has condemned the strikes and urged the US to take immediate action, adding that \"these ongoing violations\" confirm that the Israeli government \"continues its brutal war of genocide against the strip\".It said that seven of the victims were from one displaced family in Khan Younis, with a civil defence spokesman adding that the strikes hit residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station.Officials at Gaza City's Shifa hospital said an air strike on the city hit a residential apartment, killing three children and two women.\"We found my three little nieces in the street. They say 'ceasefire' and all. What did those children do? What did we do?\" said Samer al-Atbash, an uncle of the three dead children, according to Reuters news agency.Video footage and images from across Gaza showed several bodies being lifted out of rubble and a number of buildings destroyed.ReutersA police station was also hit in Gaza City, local authorities say, killing at least 12Egypt's foreign ministry condemned the strikes in a statement seen by AFP news agency, and urged all parties to \"exercise the utmost restraint\".Qatar, one of the key mediators during ceasefire talks, also denounced the \"repeated Israeli violations\", its foreign ministry said.In January, US special envoy Steve Witkoff  announced the start of phase two of the ceasefire deal.Under phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed the ceasefire in October 2025, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Witkoff said phase two would see a technocratic Palestinian government established in Gaza, the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.The war between Israel and Hamas began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.It says at least 509 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.The health ministry's figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media. Israel does not allow news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report independently.",

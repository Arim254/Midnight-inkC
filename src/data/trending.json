    "body": "1 hour agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterChina will begin easing an export ban on automotive computer chips vital to production of cars across the world as part of a trade deal struck between the US and China, the White House has said. The White House confirmed details of the deal in a new fact sheet after Xi Jinping and Donald Trump met in South Korea this week.The nations also reached agreements on US soybean exports, the supply of rare earth minerals, and the materials used in production of the drug fentanyl.  The deal de-escalates a trade war between the world's two largest economies after Trump hit China with tariffs after he entered office this year, leading to rounds of retaliatory tariffs and global business uncertainty.Much of what is in Saturday's fact sheet was announced by Trump and other officials following the meeting between the two leaders. Trump had described the talks, held in South Korea, as \"amazing\", while Beijing had said they had reached a consensus to resolve \"major trade issues\" - but did not immediately release details of the deal. Speaking on Sunday following the release of the fact sheet, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN: \"We don't want to decouple from China… (But) they've shown themselves to be an unreliable partner.\"One of the issues addressed in the deal was the export of automotive computer chips. There had been concern that a lack of chips from Nexperia, which has production facilities in China, could create global supply chain issues. Nexperia is a Chinese-owned company, but is based in the Netherlands. About 70% of Nexperia chips made in Europe are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The fact sheet states that China will \"take appropriate measures to ensure the resumption of trade from Nexperia's facilities in China, allowing production of critical legacy chips to flow to the rest of the world\".It follows Beijing saying on Saturday that it was considering exempting some firms from the ban. Last month, the likes of Volvo Cars and Volkswagen warned a chip shortage could lead to temporary shutdowns at their plants, and Jaguar Land Rover said the lack of chips posed a threat to their business. On other key issues, Beijing will now pause export controls it brought in last month on rare earth minerals - vital in the production of cars, planes and weapons - for a year. The White House also said it would lower tariffs brought in to curb the import of fentanyl into the US, with China agreeing to take \"significant measures\" to deal with the issue. Fentanyl is a synthetic drug manufactured from a combination of chemicals, and while it is approved for medical use in the US, the powerful and highly-addictive substance has since become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.The chemicals used in its manufacturing, some of which have legitimate uses, are mostly sourced from China. On soybeans, China has committed to buying 12 million tonnes of US soybeans in the last two months of 2025, and 25 million metric tonnes in each of the following three years - which is roughly the level they were previously at. China's decision to stop purchasing soybeans from the US earlier this year denied American farmers access to their largest export market. In response, Trump revived a bailout for farmers which was in place during his first term in office.",

    "body": "Three men have been killed in a US strike on an alleged drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has said. It is the latest in a series of attacks on vessels the Trump administration says are being used to smuggle drugs into the US.Since they began in September, experts have questioned the legality of the strikes under international law, which have drawn strong criticism from Latin American leaders whose citizens have been targeted.Combatting the flow of illegal drugs is a key policy for US President Donald Trump - but some have suggested the strikes are part of efforts to influence politically opposed governments in the region.Hegseth said the boat targeted on Saturday was operated by a designated terrorist organisation - without specifying which one - and had been travelling in international waters when it was hit.The vessel was travelling along a known drug-smuggling route and carrying narcotics, he said, without providing evidence.Hegseth's statement late on Saturday was accompanied by a video that appears to show a blurred-out boat travelling through the water before exploding.Announcements of these strikes are usually accompanied with grainy footage but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking and few details about who or what was on board each vessel.The Trump administration has previously said that some boats targeted had departed from Venezuela.The Trump administration has insisted that it was targeting \"narco-terrorists\".The BBC's US partner, CBS News, reported that at least 64 people have been killed by American airstrikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has previously described the attacks as \"murder\" and said they were being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Meanwhile, Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro accused Washington of \"fabricating a war\".The two left-wing leaders have increasingly been at odds with the Trump administration. Following Petro's comments, the US placed sanctions on him and his inner circle, as well as removing Colombia's certification as an ally in the war on drugs. Trump has threatened military action against land targets in Venezuela.But this, he has admitted, may require the consent of the US Congress.However, some US lawmakers, both Democrat and Republican, have said the strikes on vessels also required congressional approval - something Trump has denied. Others have questioned whether the lethal strikes were legal at all.The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk said on Friday that such attacks were a violation of international human rights law. \"Over 60 people have reportedly been killed in a continuing series of attacks carried out by US armed forces... in circumstances that find no justification in international law,\" he said. \"These attacks – and their mounting human cost – are unacceptable.\"Experts in Latin American politics have suggested the strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific were part of a suite of measures designed to influence change in Colombia and Venezuela.The US is among many nations that consider Maduro's election last year as illegitimate, while Trump has been critical of Petro's policies on combatting the drug trade in his country, which has traditionally been a US ally.Washington has steadily been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, marines, spy planes, bombers and drones in the Caribbean over the past few months, which it has framed as part of a crackdown on drug-trafficking but which military analysts say is much larger than what is needed.",

    "body": "France's consumer watchdog has reported fast fashion giant Shein to authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website. The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said in a statement that the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\", French media reported.Shein told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\" It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\".Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.The decision to allow Shein to open at BHV Marais, a shop in France's capital city that traces its roots back to 1856, has provoked controversy. The company has faced criticism for its labour practices and environmental record.Shein will open at BHV on Wednesday ahead of other shops across France, all owned by property firm Société des Grands Magasins.Commenting on the dolls sold on Shein's site, France's consumer watchdog warned that \"the dissemination, via an electronic communications network, of child pornography is punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment and a fine of €100,000 (£88,000)\".Shein said it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any content or products that violate our platform policies or applicable laws\".A spokesperson said the fast fashion firm is taking the matter \"extremely seriously\".\"We are taking immediate corrective actions and reinforcing our internal controls to prevent this from happening again,\" they said. Shein has already been fined millions of euros in recent months.In September, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de L'informatique et des Libertés, imposed a €150m (£132m) penalty on Shein for failing to get users' consent to allow \"cookies\" which collect information about people visiting a website.  Shein is contesting the fine, which it called \"wholly disproportionate\" and \"politically motivated\".",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Fireworks night in Sefton Park, Liverpool, in 2009 featuring an almost full MoonBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter The second of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 will coincide with Bonfire Night on Wednesday.The full Beaver Moon rises in the UK at around 15:55 GMT on 5 November.It will be the largest and brightest Moon this year.If you want to catch a glimpse, keep an eye on the forecast to see where has the best chance of seeing clear skies.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.November's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingThe week ahead is looking changeable, with a series of low pressure systems expected to move west to east across the UK. This means spells of rain and wind at times interspersed with calmer and drier interludes.It is too soon to say exactly where will have optimum viewing conditions for the Beaver Moon on Wednesday but the current most likely weather pattern is for a frontal system to bring cloud and rain to the south, with increasing chances of clearer skies and drier conditions further north.Keep up to date with the forecast as we approach Bonfire Night by checking the BBC Weather website or App.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "4 hours agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,in KingstonEPA/ShutterstockBlack River was one of the worst hit areas by Hurricane Melissa with residents previously telling the BBC they have lived in a state of chaos since the stormA flight chartered by the UK government to evacuate British nationals from Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Melissa has landed at Gatwick Airport.The flight, which left Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport on Saturday, comes after the UK flew in aid as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package.Some of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those to have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, blocked roads have complicated distribution after Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 28 people.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days, leaving behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 31 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK Foreign Office has asked citizens there to register their presence and advised travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options were available.The UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday as \"more information... on the scale of the devastation\" emerged.The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.The Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others to drive to an area where they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.AFP via Getty ImagesParts of St Elizabeth have experienced flooding in recent daysThe country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals on Saturday - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said. \"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services.\"Dr Tufton added: \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet.\"The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a daily supply of water.Landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating the distribution of aid across the island.However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief by Sunday.At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out from Kingston on Saturday with a seven-truck convoy heading to Black River, the badly damaged town in western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon.Melissa - the strongest hurricane so far this year - made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday, with sustained winds of up to 185mph (295km/h).A category five storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale is the strongest kind, with wind speeds in excess of 157mph, making hurricanes of this strength capable of catastrophic destruction.",

    "body": "8 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentJas BainsJas Bains alerted Danish authorities to a £1bn tax scam and they hit him with a lawsuit\"We'd be met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"In 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.Today, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.The irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.He is reflecting one month after the case ended, bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.The Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.It all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in the so-called cum-ex trade.This focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).Those involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.From the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.It initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.Jas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".Getty ImagesSanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year And making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"It didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"By mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"Alarm bells were ringing.Jas BainsAt the height of his career Jas Bains enjoyed living the high life in Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"Solo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.With that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.He contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.Danish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was sentenced to 12 years in jail.It was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.'Impossible to get a job'But when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.With that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London. \"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.However, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.Acknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.The authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.That seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"There may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An advisor to Nigeria's president told the BBC that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Mr Bwala, who said he was a Christian pastor, told the BBC's Newshour programme that Trump had a \"unique way of communicating\" and that Nigeria was not taking his words literally.\"We know the heart and intent of Trump is to help us fight insecurity,\" he said, adding that he hoped Trump would meet Tinubu in the coming days to discuss the issue.Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in Abuja",

    "body": "14 hours agoPete AllisonBBC NewsbeatIsha Shah\"All-singing, all-dancing\" Paddington, as he appears in the new West End musicalHe's famous for his voyage from Peru to London, but it didn't take as long as his journey to the Savoy Theatre.After nearly a decade in the works, Paddington: The Musical is here.And its star is walking, talking, singing, dancing - and offering BBC Newsbeat a snack.\"I've brought you this marmalade sandwich, but it's only for emergencies.\"A first glimpse of the impressive bear, whose design was a closely guarded secret for years, dropped on socials on Saturday night.His fur is pristine.His famous \"hard stare\" is piercing.His face is so expressive, every twitch will reach the back row of an audience.But if you're looking for insight into his \"magical\" design and how he was brought to life, his creators aren't giving much away.Jay BrooksPaddington's design is inspired by Peggy Fortnum's \"delicate\" illustrations for author Michael Bond's 1958 book, A Bear Called PaddingtonWhen Newsbeat asks, everyone involved in the West End production gives the same response.\"Paddington is Paddington.\"And designer Tahra Zafar, an experienced creative whose CV includes Harry Potter, Marvel and Star Wars films, wants to keep it that way. \"I don't want people to think about how we've done it,\" she says.\"I just want people to love him.\"She does let on that the team looked at \"some very innovative ways\" to get Paddington moving, but says traditional puppetry was ruled out.They concluded that audiences' hearts wouldn't shatter at the bear's loneliness in London if he was literally kept company on-stage.The theory is currently being tested as Paddington gets some preview performances under his hat before the show's official opening in late November.\"I feel completely ready,\" laughs Tahra, with a mix of excitement and relief.\"I love him to bits, but I want to share him.\"'I just burst into tears'Rachel JosephTom Fletcher is juggling touring the UK and Ireland with McFly and Busted with launching Paddington: The MusicalMichael Bond's original creation has broken and warmed hearts for generations.A trilogy of films, with Ben Whishaw voicing its lead, made more than $500m (£380m) at the global box office.But no previous adaptation of Paddington's story brought him to life in such a tangible way.And no-one had found his voice in musical theatre until producers set McFly singer-songwriter Tom Fletcher that task.\"You can spend forever thinking 'how do I write a song that sounds like Paddington?',\" he tells Newsbeat.\"You just have to trust that it's going to come through, as long as you've done the research.\"Moments into Tom's initial call with producers, he started composing a song that remains in the musical five years later.\"I think I wrote five songs in that first process and they're all still in the show,\" he says.\"I know on paper 'that guy from McFly' may be an odd choice, but I was in musicals from the age of nine. \"I never thought I would end up in a band.\"For me, this is a return to what I love,\" he says, decades after playing the lead in Oliver! at the London Palladium.As for Paddington: The Musical's star, Tom first met him two years ago.The bear's design and technology waited in the wings while the cast and production were pulled together around it.\"You never forget when you first meet Paddington,\" Tom says, echoing a sentiment almost everyone involved tells Newsbeat with a glassy look in their eyes.\"I just burst into tears,\" says Tom.\"Once we met him, we all thought: 'This is going to work, and it's going to be so special'.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this story",

    "body": "24 October 2025Louise ParryBedfordshire, Hertfordshire and BuckinghamshireLucy North/PA MediaEmily Henders is taking part in a trial of T-cell therapy, which has proved successful in treating blood cancerA biology teacher and mother-of-two has become the first UK patient to receive a \"gamechanger\" therapy to treat multiple sclerosis (MS).Emily Henders, 37, from Bushey, Hertfordshire, was treated at University College London Hospital (UCLH) as part of a global clinical trial.Mrs Henders had experienced \"really scary\" relapse episodes since being diagnosed in December 2021 during which, she said: \"My legs don't work, I can't walk.\"Experts believe the targeted immunotherapy treatment could \"transform\" lives by slowing or even halting progression of the disease.\"I hope taking part in the trial means I will never have to experience another relapse and that my MS symptoms will not progress,\" Mrs Henders said.\"I know it is still experimental but it offers a scientific rationale which, as a biology teacher, makes sense to me.\"Family handout/PA MediaMrs Henders and her husband Brandon would like to have a third child, but are concerned about the impact on her MSMultiple sclerosis is an \"autoimmune\" disease, which happens when the immune system attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord by mistake.The experimental treatment, known as CAR T cell therapy, aims to reset the immune system.It works by depleting B cells, which are thought to drive the autoimmune attack in MS.The patient's own T cells, which hunt out infected or damaged cells, are genetically engineered and fed back into the patient via an infusion to \"re-set\" the immune system.Mrs Henders, who has sons aged six and four, told the PA news agency she was feeling well after receiving the infusion in a three-minute procedure.\"I'm actually feeling really good. I'm feeling normal and I've got energy back.\"I don't have any nausea, I've had no fevers. I'm feeling pretty relaxed,\" she said.Lucy North/PA MediaThe trial aims to recruit up to 18 patients globally by early 2027Mrs Henders, whose father also has MS, was diagnosed on Christmas Eve after suffering tingling in her hands.\"Physically, my symptoms have progressively got worse,\" she said.\"I notice sometimes my foot hits the pavement in a funny way. Or when I'm teaching and my hands are shaking.\"Mrs Henders will \"never forget\" her first major relapse when her children saw her taken away by ambulance.\"I was getting out of bed and I couldn't stand up - it was very scary,\" she said.\"I'll never forget my children's faces as the medics were rushing in and strapping me to a chair.\"Emotionally, I worry for them and how they're dealing with it.\"I worry that this might be passed on to them. It's very scary for the future, not knowing what the next relapse would bring.\"Lucy North/PA MediaEmily is one of 150,000 people in the UK with Multiple SclerosisMrs Henders hopes the treatment will avoid the decline typical in MS patients, who often require a wheelchair.\"It would mean I'll be able to chase my children around, and I'll still be able to work,\" she said.\"I wouldn't be able to be a science teacher in a wheelchair or even on crutches.\"It's too much of a health and safety hazard, so that would have a real impact on my job.\"A spokesperson for the MS Society said: \"It's early days but, if trial results prove successful, CAR T-cell therapy could be a gamechanger for how we treat the condition.\"UCLH consultant haematologist Claire Roddie said the team was \"excited\" about the trial.\"We are taking a treatment developed to treat cancers and re-purposing it for a whole new spectrum of conditions,\" she said.\"We give CAR T-cell therapy - bang, you're in, you get the treatment, and that's it.\"Hopefully you don't need any more drugs beyond that point.\"If we could achieve that in MS, it would transform so many people's lives.\"Related storiesRelated links",

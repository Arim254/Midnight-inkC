The Government says the legislation is designed to protect the mental wellbeing of Australian children and teens – but it’s already proving controversial, not least among American tech companies and some politicians who see the ban as a threat to free speech.  \nIn today’s episode, we are joined by Katy Watson, the BBC’s Australia correspondent, to discuss how the country became a global test case for a bold new policy – and crucially, whether it will succeed.  \nProducers: Cat Farnsworth, Aron Keller and Xandra Ellin\nMix: Travis Evans\nSenior News Editor: China Collins\nPhoto: A teen using her phone ahead of social media band for users under 16.

    "body": "3 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterWatch: Rare moment in the Commons as vote end in tieThirteen Labour MPs have backed a Liberal Democrat bill requiring the government to begin negotiations on joining a bespoke customs union with the EU.Labour's manifesto ruled out re-joining the existing EU custom union and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has recently said such a move was \"not currently our policy\".The vote on the bill was tied, with 100 MPs voting each way leaving Deputy Speaker Caroline Nokes to cast the deciding vote. She told MPs she would back the bill \"in order to allow for further debate\". Although the bill has progressed, it is highly unlikely to become law unless it receives government support. It is the first time a vote has been tied in the House of Commons since 2019, when MPs voted on alternative plans for Brexit. Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler and Dame Meg Hillier were among those Labour MPs to back the UK-EU Customs Union Bill.The majority of Labour MPs abstained on the bill, while three voted against: Jonathan Brash, Luke Myer and Josh Newbury.Eighty-nine Conservative MPs and four members of Reform UK voted against the bill. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the vote was a \"historic victory\" for his party.\"The prime minister must now listen to Parliament and the public, drop his self-imposed red lines and finally go for proper growth through an ambitious trade deal with the EU,\" he added.The Speaker casts his vote according to what was done in similar circumstances in the past. Where possible the issue should remain open for further discussion and no final decision should be made by a casting vote.According to parliamentary rules, when a vote is tied, the Speaker should cast the deciding vote \"according to what was done in similar circumstances in the past\".\"Where possible the issue should remain open for further discussion and no final decision should be made by a casting vote.\"The UK left the customs union - which eases trade barriers by allowing member states to charge the same taxes on goods imported from outside the bloc - after the country voted for Brexit.The government has been trying to build a closer relationship with the EU including through deals on food standards rules, electricity trading and visas for young people.Speaking in Parliament, the Liberal Democrats' Europe spokesperson Al Pinkerton told MPs his customs union bill would \"cut red tape, unlock investment and restore certainty to British business\".He said Brexit had been \"an abject economic failure\" which had \"choked business investment, shattered economic resilience, strangled trade, stifled the economy and left everyone of us poorer\".Despite having opposed Brexit, Conservative Simon Hoare urged MPs not to back the bill.He argued that joining a customs union would go against the wishes of the public who backed Brexit in the referendum and would create uncertainty for businesses. He also said it would mean unpicking trading relationships with other countries such as Australia and that the EU didn't want such a union. \"There is neither interest in it nor appetite for it,\" he added. In recent months, Labour ministers, including the prime minister, have become more vocal in their criticism of Brexit. Earlier this month, Sir Keir wrote in the Guardian that \"the botched Brexit deal significantly hurt our economy\". More recently, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy told The News Agents podcast:  \"It's self-evident that leaving the European Union badly damaged our economy, took us out of an important marketplace and created serious friction.\"Asked whether he wanted to the UK to have a customs union with the EU, he said: \"That's not currently our policy, that's not currently where we are.\"However, he added that Turkey, which is in a customs union with the bloc, was \"seemingly benefiting and seeing growth in their economy\".",

    "body": "Trains, flights and ferries have been cancelled and thousands left without power as Storm Bram brought heavy rain, strong winds and unseasonably mild temperatures to large parts of the UK.Amber warnings for wind, which mean a possible danger to life, are in place in part of Northern Ireland and northern Scotland, where forecasters say gusts could reach speeds of 90mph (145 km/h).Yellow warnings for wind are in place across Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as northern and south-west England.As of 17:25 GMT, there were 90 flood warnings in place across the UK, with 37 flood warnings in England, 20 in Wales and 33 in Scotland.The storm has brought exceptionally mild air to the country, with some regions registering temperatures as high as 16C (60F) - significantly higher than the December average of 5-9C.In Scotland, several ferry routes on the west coast were cancelled or face disruption, ferry operator CalMac has warned.ScotRail announced that some trains in the North West would finish early and said there would be speed restrictions and delays in other parts of the country.The Met Office issued an amber warning for very strong and disruptive winds in north-west Scotland between 16:00 and 23:59 on Tuesday.Some Scottish schools closed early due to the forecast.An amber wind warning in Northern Ireland is due to last until 20:00.Dozens of flights between the island of Ireland and Great Britain were cancelled.Ulster University in Northern Ireland closed some of its campuses, while the country's Education Authority asked schools to monitor and assess the weather warnings in their areas.In Wales, a yellow warning covered the whole of the country until 19:00.South Wales and south-west England saw heavy rain overnight, with both regions covered by amber warnings that expired at 10:00 on Tuesday.BBC South West's senior broadcast meteorologist David Braine said Dartmoor in Devon saw almost a month's worth of rainfall over the past 48 hours.Many houses in Totnes were flooded as the River Dart - which carries water from Dartmoor - grew swollen with rainwater.Rail services, including some services to London, have been disrupted in both areas because of the rain.In the west of England, Great Western Railway is reporting cancellations due to flooding between:Par and NewquayTotnes and PlymouthSwindon and Bristol ParkwayIn Wales, various Transport for Wales services are experiencing disruption: flooding has led to the closure of all lines between Aberdare and Abercynon. Some rail replacement coaches are operating.National Rail has warned some Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway and TransPennine Express services are affected - with the full details available on its website.Thousands in England and Wales have been left without power. As of 16:30, just over 4,000 properties had no electricity, according to National Grid.Storm Bram follows Storm Amy in October, which caused travel disruption, power cuts and storm damage to thousands of homes across the UK.Named by Ireland's national weather service, Met Éireann, Storm Bram is expected to cause ongoing disruption throughout Tuesday before clearing on Wednesday.Storm Bram is the fourth named storm to hit the UK this season, after Amy, Benjamin and Claudia - so why did forecasters go back to the letter B?It comes down to how storms are named and who actually names them, BBC lead weather presenter Matt Taylor says.The UK's Met Office, Ireland's Met Éireann and KNMI in the Netherlands group together to track major storms. Storms are named when they are expected to have a significant impact in at least one of the countries in the group, and are not based on any rainfall or wind speed thresholds.The alphabetic storm name list is decided jointly by the group every year, following submissions from the public. Storm Bram is only the second storm to be named by the group this season, with the Irish weather service announcing Bram's naming.Benjamin was named by the French weather service, and Claudia by the Spanish service because of the impacts the low pressure systems would have in those nations first.",

    "body": "A federal judge in New York has ruled the US Department of Justice can publicly release grand jury materials from Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking investigation.US District Judge Paul Engelmayer said he was ordering the release of material because of a recent law passed by Congress, which requires the justice department to publish files related to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein by the end of next week. In his ruling, he said the court would put in place mechanisms to protect victims from the release of materials that would \"identify them or otherwise invade their privacy\". Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in luring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, to exploit. Epstein died in prison in 2019.Prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein.Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August, after she was interviewed by Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche about Epstein. In a letter to Judge Engelmayer, Maxwell's legal team said she did not take a position on the justice department's motion to release the grand jury material.Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, which has released thousands of files and messages it subpoenaed from Epstein's estate, said the unsealing was a \"victory for transparency\". \"These files are now part of the Epstein files held by the Department of Justice, and must be turned over to the Oversight Committee in response to our subpoena,\" he said. The order to publish the records followed a similar ruling from a judge in Florida on Friday, which allowed for the unsealing of documents related to the state's investigation against Epstein that began in 2005.Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November after previously rejecting calls to release the files. The law \"applies to unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" that relate to Epstein and Maxwell, a court order said.The justice department has until 19 December to publicly release all the information from federal investigations into Epstein, though the law also allows the department to withhold files that involve active criminal investigations or raise privacy concerns.Florida and New York judges had previously refused to unseal grand jury materials related to Epstein, citing federal rules that require grand jury processes to be kept secret.But after Congress passed the bill to release the Epstein material, the justice department made the same request, arguing the legislation's \"clear mandate\" should \"override\" those secrecy rules.",

Baroness Anne Longfield will lead the inquiry, which was derailed when four women resigned from its survivors panel and two leading candidates to chair the investigation pulled out.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said \"we must root out this evil once and for all\" as she told the Commons the peer would lead the three-year inquiry.The prime minister announced the inquiry for England and Wales in June after accepting the recommendation of Baroness Louise Casey's audit into group-based child sexual abuse.On her appointment, Baroness Longfield said the inquiry \"owes it to the victims, survivors and the wider public to identify the truth, address past failings and ensure that children and young people today are protected in a way that others were not\".She added: \"The inquiry will follow the evidence and will not shy away from difficult or uncomfortable truths wherever we find them.\"Baroness Longfield will be supported by panellists Zoe Billingham, a former inspector at HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, and Eleanor Kelly, former chief executive of Southwark Council.Mahmood said Baroness Longfield and the two panellists had been recommended by Baroness Casey following \"recent engagement with victims\" and would meet survivors later this week.But one of the survivors who quit the inquiry in October, Fiona Goddard, told the BBC no one on the panel \"had any consultations about these candidates\", signalling that their involvement had been \"just a box-ticking exercise\".She also criticised the selection of Baroness Longfield, who was appointed to the House of Lords in January and will resign the Labour whip to chair the inquiry.Ms Goddard said: \"The fact they have chosen someone so closely connected with the Labour government raises serious concerns over how impartial and independent this inquiry will be.\"Another victim, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC it was \"about time\" a chair was appointed, and that she liked Baroness Longfield.But she added: \"What if nothing changes? You hear with these big inquiries that recommendations are made, but they're not always implemented.\"The inquiry will comprise a series of targeted local investigations into the group-based child sexual exploitation of girls by grooming gangs, overseen by a national panel. As a statutory inquiry, it will have more powers - such as requiring people to testify and release other forms of evidence.Mahmood said one of these would be in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with the other locations to be decided.No area will be able to \"resist\" a local investigation during the inquiry, she added, which would last three years with a budget of £65m under draft terms of reference, which will be consulted on and confirmed by March 2026.The inquiry will also \"explicitly\" consider the backgrounds of offenders, including their ethnicity and religion, Mahmood said, and \"whether the authorities failed to properly investigate what happened out of a misplaced desire to protect community cohesion\".She noted that Baroness Casey's audit concluded that in some local areas a \"disproportionate\" amount of suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation were from Asian ethnic backgrounds where sufficient police data had been collected.\"Like every member of my community who I know, I am horrified by these acts,\" said Mahmood.\"The sickening acts of a minority of evil men - as well as those in positions of authority who looked the other way - must not be allowed to marginalise or demonise entire communities of law-abiding citizens.\"Baroness Casey's report also found that ethnicity data was not recorded for two-thirds of cases, meaning it was not robust enough to support conclusions about offenders at a national level.Mahmood said she had commissioned new research to \"rectify the unacceptable gaps\" in this area, and that she would draft a law as soon as possible so that police had to gather ethnicity data.She added that the government was working to disregard prostitution offences levelled against some victims with its Crime and Policing Bill.Responding in the Commons, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp called for an apology from the prime minister for having \"disgracefully smeared those calling for an inquiry as far-right\" earlier this year.In January, Sir Keir Starmer dismissed calls for a national inquiry, arguing the scandal had already been examined in a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay. He also suggested those calling for an investigation were \"jumping on a bandwagon\" and \"amplifying\" the demands of the far-right\". The scandal had returned to prominence partly because of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was criticising the prime minister for not calling a national inquiry.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch meanwhile said progress on the inquiry was welcome but survivors have been waiting too long for an inquiry they can trust.The inquiry was thrown into chaos in October when four women resigned from its survivors liaison panel in protest at how the government had handled the process so far.They called for Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips to resign, accusing her of \"betrayal\" for denying claims the investigation might be broadened beyond grooming gangs.They also expressed doubts about two candidates proposed to chair the inquiry because one had a background in social work and the other as a senior police officer - two professions facing questions about trust.At the time, Phillips denied claims of a cover-up and insisted the government was \"committed to exposing the failures\".Five others abuse survivors wrote to the prime minister to say they would only continue working with the inquiry if Phillips kept her job.In the Commons on Tuesday, Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin said the party welcomed the announcement and that victims would be \"properly consulted\".She asked whether Phillips would be called as a witness in the inquiry, claiming victims had \"lost all confidence\" in her.Mahmood said she hoped politicians would \"elevate beyond party political point-scoring\" and focus on delivering justice for victims.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Max Wilkinson said his party welcomed Mahmood's statement but said questions remained, such as how the inquiry would remain \"free from political influence\", earn the trust of victims and their families, and \"avoid stigmatising entire communities\" while thoroughly investigating the matter.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has criticised European leaders as \"weak\" and suggested the US could scale back support for Ukraine.In a wide-ranging interview with Politico, he said \"decaying\" European countries had failed to control migration or take decisive action to end Ukraine's war with Russia, accusing them of letting Kyiv fight \"until they drop\". European leaders have made attempts to carve out a role in the US-led efforts to end the war, which they fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.In response, the UK's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said all she saw in Europe was \"strength\", citing investment in defence as well as funding for Kyiv.She added two presidents were \"working for peace\" - referring to Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - and \"one president - President Putin - has so far simply sought to escalate the conflict with further drone and missile attacks\".Trump continued to increase pressure on Zelensky to agree to a deal to end the conflict, and urged him to \"play ball\" by ceding territory to Moscow. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Zelensky, writing on X later on Tuesday, said Ukraine and Europe were working actively on \"all components of potential steps toward ending the war\", that the Ukrainian and European elements of the plan were now more developed and that Kyiv was ready to present them to \"our partners in the US\".Trump's latest public criticism of Europe comes a day after European leaders came together in London to discuss their continued joint efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine.Asked whether Europe could help end the war, the US president said: \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"US officials have held separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent weeks in an attempt to broker an end to the war. So far, no agreement has been reached.Ukraine's president has pressed European and Nato leaders to help deter the US from backing a deal that Kyiv fears would leave it exposed to future attack.On Sunday Trump suggested, without evidence, that Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace. He told reporters that Russia was \"fine\" with the peace plan outlined to both sides by the US, that contained major concessions for Ukraine and which allies feared would leave it vulnerable to a future invasion.In the Politico interview, he claimed Ukrainian negotiators \"loved\" the US-backed proposal and alleged Zelensky had not yet read it.Trump also claimed ideological divisions now threatened to fracture Washington's alliances with Europe.Asked whether leaders he viewed as weak could still be allies, he replied: \"It depends\", adding: \"I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct. I think they don't know what to do.\"The president's remarks came after his administration released its new 33-page National Security Strategy, which warned of Europe's potential \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether some nations could remain reliable allies. Russia welcomed that strategy - which did not cast Russia as a threat to the US - as \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision.Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe \"will not be viable countries any longer\" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: \"What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.\"He singled out Hungary and Poland as doing a \"very good job\" on immigration, but said most European nations were \"decaying\".Responding on Tuesday to the strategy, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said some parts were plausible and some understandable, but other elements were unacceptable from a European point of view. He rejected the idea that the US needed to \"save democracy\" in Europe, saying Europeans could address such questions themselves.The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGoogleGoogle plans to launch smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in 2026, after its previous high-profile attempt to enter the market ended in failure.The tech giant set expectations high in 2013 when it unveiled Google Glass, billed by some as the future of technology despite its odd appearance with a bulky screen positioned above the right eye. Google pulled the product in 2015 less than seven months after its UK release, but is now planning on re-entering the market with smart glasses with a cleaner look.But it comes after Meta has already made waves with its smart specs, which have sold two million pairs as of February.Google's new tech will let users interact with its own AI products, such as its chatbot Gemini.It plans to launch two different varieties - one designed to be provide assistance without any kind of screen, and another which has a display on the glasses themselves.While saying the first of the two types of AI glasses it is working on would come in 2026, Google has not given more information on what form it will take.Technology analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC the tech firm \"must avoid the pitfalls of its previous failed attempt\".\"Arguably, the move was ahead of its time, poorly conceived and executed,\" he said.\"Now represents an opportune moment, thanks to the success of Gemini.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass on-stage at an event in 2012.Google will also have to contend with Meta, which unveiled its own AI-powered glasses earlier this year, having built on its existing collaborations with luxury eyewear brands Ray-Ban and Oakley.According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, the sector saw a surge in the first half of 2025, driven by demand for Meta's devices and the launch of similar products by smaller brands.It said sales of AI glasses had grown by more than 250% compared to the previous year.What went wrong with Google Glass?Google Glass was launched in 2013 as a pair of thin, wireframe glasses with a chunky right arm to accommodate a camera built into the corner of the right lens.Wearers could use the camera to take images and record their surroundings, while simultaneously interact with a digital display The device created a lot of excitement when it first appeared at a Google event in June 2012.But after its launch the following year, concerns about its impact on privacy, potential for abuse and questions about its style and usefulness arose - and grew until Google Google said it would stop making them in that form in 2015.A revamped version, Google Glass Enterprise, appeared two years later but was retired in 2023.Former BBC Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones was among those who had deemed Google's device in its initial form to be \"a failure\".The success of so-called wearable computers, he wrote, would likely depend on having the tech to bring their potential to life and them being \"both attractive to wear and so easy to use that you forget that you have them on\".Today, tech giants have tried to make AI and smart glasses more wearable by partnering with designer eyewear brands - and can pack more power and features into smaller, sleeker frames.But there remain concerns about privacy and usability.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent Pacemaker PressIRA spy Stakeknife was revealed to be west Belfast man Freddie Scappaticci, who died in 2023.The major investigation into the state agent in the IRA known as Stakeknife has revealed MI5 had a bigger role in his handling than previously claimed.The final report of Operation Kenova also said the belated discovery and disclosure of documents by MI5 to the investigation last year was \"a serious organisational failure\".Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, who died in 2023, but the Kenova remains gagged by the government from officially naming him.He worked as a British agent from the late 1970s until the 1990s, and has been linked to 14 murders and 15 abductions. MI5 and the Army knew about his role in the IRA's feared internal security unit, and his involvement in torturing and killing people accused of being informers.Operation Kenova's stark conclusions on MI5's candour is just the latest severe criticism of the security service by the courts and official inquiries in the past two years.In 2023, the public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing – which killed 22 people – found that MI5's senior corporate witness had given inaccurate evidence about the key intelligence it held on the bomber before the attack.Earlier this year, MI5 was forced to apologise after the BBC proved it gave false evidence to three courts in a case concerning a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X. MI5 then tried to withhold further damning material from the High Court, and its third-in-command gave an inaccurate account of what had happened to senior judges, leading to the prime minister ordering a new investigation. Jon Boutcher, Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable, says he thinks that MI5 has an issue with its approach to legacy cases in Northern Ireland and that things must change.But there is also wider question about whether MI5 can be trusted to provide truthful and full evidence to courts and investigations.This poses a profound challenge to the government, which acts on behalf of MI5 in the courts and relies on its intelligence assessments to make big decisions.MI5's evidence really matters. As with Operation Kenova, that evidence frequently relates to matters of life and death, but also cases concerning people whose British citizenship has been stripped or people whose liberties have been removed.There are calls for MI5 to be subjected to increased scrutiny and be held more accountable under the law.Campaigners behind the imminent Hillsborough Law are demanding that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should be subjected to the same duty of candour as other public bodies and government agencies.The law will create a new legal duty on public bodies and servants to act truthfully and fully support investigations into the state, ensuring wrongdoing is not concealed.However, as things stand, the duty will not apply in the same way to MI5 and intelligence agencies, with individual MI5 officers not subjected to the duty, unlike people who work for organisations like the police.Given Kenova's conclusions, how will ministers and lawmakers now react?Another big issue for the government and MI5 is the refusal to allow Kenova to name the agent Stakeknife, despite repeated requests to do so, with the consequence that much of what was uncovered cannot be publicly described in case it identifies the agent.As everyone knows, Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, and Jon Boutcher on Tuesday said the ban on identifying Stakeknife was a \"pantomime\".MI5 justifies the ban with reference to its core 'neither confirm nor deny' (NCND) secrecy policy, which has long been presented in a public as a monolithic principle that cannot be deviated from.But in the neo-Nazi Agent X case, MI5 was forced to abandon NCND and confirm the man at the centre of the case was a state informant, after the BBC proved it had told me the man was an agent when it was trying to cover for him. MI5 was also forced to accept it had misled a court by not revealing the existence of policies relating to departures from NCND – policies it had kept secret.Last year, Kenova recommended that the government should review, codify and define the proper limits of the NCND policy as it relates to the identification of agents and its application in the context of Northern Ireland legacy cases.On Tuesday, Kenova said no substantive progress has yet been made on the recommendation, and it is unclear whether and when this may change.But the Stakeknife \"pantomime\", and MI5's lack of candour in other major cases, is now placing pressure on the government to act.Email: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @danields39.63Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterClaudia Winkleman was all smiles on Tuesday after being made an MBE by King Charles III at an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle.The Traitors and Strictly Come Dancing presenter was recognised in the King's Birthday Honours this summer alongside her Strictly co-host, Tess Daly, for services to broadcasting.Winkleman, who wore a white suit with matching headband and a black shirt for the occasion, was joined by family - including her mother, journalist Eve Pollard - at the royal residence.Following the event, the star posted on Instagram: \"An incredible morning and an enormous honour. I'm speechless.\"Winkleman won a Bafta award in 2023 for her deadpan work on The Traitors, which returns in the New Year.Alan Carr won the recent celebrity version, with the final episode being watched by a peak audience of 12 million, according to the BBC.Until the success of the show, Winkleman was best known for co-presenting BBC One's flagship celebrity dance contest, Strictly, to which she has been bringing her warmth and wit in one form or another since 2004.She first presented its spin-off show, It Takes Two, then began co-presenting the Sunday night results show alongside Daly in 2010.It was 2014 when the pair first presented the main Saturday night show together, with Winkleman filling the big shoes of Bruce Forsyth.The presenting duo announced in October that they will both be leaving at the end of the current series, with the Christmas Day special marking their final appearance.\"We have loved working as a duo and hosting Strictly has been an absolute dream. We were always going to leave together and now feels like the right time,\" they wrote in a joint statement on Instagram.Last month Daly was honoured by the King, whose wife, Queen Camilla, last year revealed: \"We all watch it. I'm one of Strictly's greatest fans.\"Winkleman's sister, Peep Show actress Sophie Winkleman, became a member of the Royal family herself after marrying Lord Frederick Windsor.Alongside It Takes Two, Winkleman began hosting various reality shows including BBC Three's The House of Tiny Tearaways and ITV's Hell's Kitchen, before she took the helm as one of the co-presenters of BBC One's Film programme, following the departure of Jonathan Ross.She also hosted Comic Relief, The Great British Sewing Bee and The Piano talent show on Channel 4, as well as a raft of shows on BBC Radio 2.Earlier this year she was given the Royal Television Society's outstanding achievement award.After being named on the honours list in June, Winkleman said she was \"incredibly grateful to receive this honour\".\"It's a real privilege to work with extraordinarily talented people and I have only got this because of them. So this is for the BBC, the Traitors and the Faithful, for pianos and for the cha cha,\" she added.Meanwhile on Tuesday, Sir Antony Gormley was also recognised by King Charles at the same ceremony.The Angel of the North sculptor joined the elite Companions of Honour, an exclusive group limited to only 65 recipients at any one time.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondent in PavlohradBBC/Matthew GoddardUkrainian soldiers in Pokrovsk show a Ukrainian flag to prove the city has not yet fallenPokrovsk has not fallen yet. That is despite President Vladimir Putin's recent claim that Russian forces have taken the city. There is no doubt Ukraine has been losing ground in this key city in the east. For Russia, Pokrovsk is another stepping stone towards its goal of taking control of all of the Donbas. But Ukraine needs to prove it is still capable of resisting.At a Ukrainian command post, well behind the front line, orders are relayed by radio in rapid and quick succession. Soldiers watch dozens of live drone feeds. They are coordinating strikes on Russian positions inside the city.The commander of the Skala Assault Regiment, Yuri, is keen to prove to us that Ukraine still controls the north of the city - to show that the Kremlin's claim that it has taken Pokrovsk is a lie.Over the radio, they ask two of their soldiers to break cover from a building to display a Ukrainian flag. They move quickly to avoid being spotted. The drone feed shows the moment they briefly wave their yellow and blue flag, before quickly returning to cover.BBC/Matthew GoddardBattalion commanders are adamant they still have a foothold in PokrovskYuri tells me: \"You've now seen it with your own eyes.\"\"I think the whole world should know we will not just give up our territory,\" he says. \"If we do not show this, everyone will lose faith and stop helping Ukraine.\"The battle for Pokrovsk, once a key logistics hub for Ukraine's military, has been grinding on for nearly 18 months. The city is already in ruins. The question now is how much longer can Ukraine hold on. Those tracking the Russian advances suggest Ukrainian forces barely have a hold on the city. Russian forces have slowly been advancing from the south. Ukraine is losing ground, but says it still holds the north, up to the railway line that bisects the city.Sasha, a 25-year-old battalion commander, shows me a map. On top he has placed green plastic soldiers to represent where Ukrainian troops are still defending. Brown plastic soldiers show where their enemy has advanced. The Russians have been using small teams of two to four soldiers to sneak past Ukrainian positions, sometimes dressed as civilians. \"It's a good tactic to get behind enemy lines, to gain a foothold,\" Sasha says. But he adds: \"The enemy who gets into our rear is quickly identified – it takes 15 to 20 minutes between detection and destruction.\"BBC/Matthew GoddardGreen and brown plastic soldiers on Sasha's Ukrainian map show the two armies still fighting in PokrovskRussia has suffered heavy casualties, but still has more troops. A Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Rabbit shows me passports and documents retrieved from their dead. I asked him if he thinks they have killed a lot of Russians. \"Not enough,\" he replies.Rabbit described the situation as \"hard, but under control\". He shows me a Russian machine gun captured by one of his comrades who spent 70 straight days fighting in Pokrovsk. \"All he wanted was cigarettes and ammunition,\" says Rabbit.The fighting is clearly taking its toll on Ukrainian forces, but there is no sign of them giving up. Nor does Rabbit agree with any suggestion that Ukraine should give up more land for peace. He says too much blood has already been spilt: \"We are part of this land. If we give it up Russia will want more.\"Another soldier - call sign \"Ghost\" - fighting in another unit in Pokrovsk describes the situation as \"tense, but not critical\". He dismisses reports of its capture as \"Russian propaganda\", saying reports that \"Pokrovsk is surrounded is fake information\", but adds that \"everyone is exhausted – both Russia and Ukraine\".For Ukraine, holding ground is also proving costly. The Skala Regiment shares recent videos taken by their troops on the front line - often having to take cover in buildings from Russian drones. The buzz of an approaching drone is often accompanied by heavy automatic fire as they try to bring it down.\"Khotabych\", who recently spent a month fighting in the city, says it is scary when the drones spot you: \"There are lots and they fly round the clock.\"The Russians have more drones with thermal imaging cameras, which can see at night. Khotabych said he and his men always hope for \"good weather\" – by which he means fog, rain and grey sky. In other words, anything that makes it more difficult to fly.BBC/Matthew GoddardThe Skala Regiment's deputy commander, \"Godfather\", warns that Putin will not stop after UkraineIn Pokrovsk, Ukrainian soldiers are focused on the fighting, not peace talks. Most say they want to avoid \"political questions\". But a volunteer from Latvia – the Skala Regiment's deputy commander – is more willing to give an opinion. He says Latvians \"understand that if Ukraine loses the war, it's going to be our country next\".  His call sign is \"Godfather\" and he has a tough message for Europe and the US. He describes President Donald Trump as a \"charismatic and strong leader\", but he says if Trump's peace envoy Steve Witkoff \"stands with Putin, then it makes America and Trump look weak\". As for Europe, he says \"there's a lot of talking, a lot of bureaucracy and not enough doing\".The message from the troops we talked to is that the situation in Pokrovsk is not so bleak. But Ukraine needs proof of its resolve at this critical time.Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Kyla Herrmannsen.",

    "body": "Fifa's ethics committee has been asked to investigate president Gianni Infantino, claiming he broke the governing body's rules on political neutrality in relation to United States president Donald Trump.Infantino awarded Trump with the inaugural Fifa peace prize at the 2026 World Cup draw in Washington DC last week, and has also done social media posts and interviews in support of the 79-year-old. Human rights campaign group FairSquare has written a letter of complaint, which BBC Sport has seen, alleging Infantino has \"committed four clear breaches\" of Fifa's neutrality rules.\"The award of a prize of this nature to a sitting political leader is in, and of itself, a clear breach of Fifa's duty of neutrality,\" the letter stated.\"The Fifa president does not have the authority to unilaterally dictate the organisation's mission, strategic direction, policies and values.\"BBC Sport has contacted football's world governing body for comment. Infantino and Trump stood side by side during the glittering ceremony at the Kennedy Center for next year's tournament, which takes place in the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June-19 July. As well as a large golden trophy, Trump received a medal and certificate from Infantino, who said \"this is what we want from a leader\" and \"you can always count, Mr President, on my support\" during a speech that followed a video before the presentation. In October, the 55-year-old posted on Instagram saying Trump \"definitely deserves\" the Nobel Peace Prize.During an interview in November at the American Business Forum in Miami, Infantino also added: \"We should all support what [Trump] is doing [in the US] because I think it's looking pretty good.\"FairSquare also alleged a video post by Infantino on Instagram in January - following his invite to Trump's inauguration - \"indicates support for President Trump's political agenda\". Nicholas McGeehan, FairSquare's programme director, added: \"This complaint is about a lot more than Infantino's support for President Donald Trump's political agenda.\"More broadly this is about how Fifa's absurd governance structure has allowed Gianni Infantino to openly flout the organisation's rules and act in ways that are both dangerous and directly contrary to the interests of the world's most popular sport.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHazel Shearing,Education correspondentandKate McGough,Education reporterGetty ImagesSome schools have had to bring back Covid-like measures to prevent the spread of flu, as rates of reported illnesses in schools and other educational settings are higher than this time last year. One primary school in Leeds said last week it had to cut back on singing in assemblies and introduce sanitisation stations, while another in Caerphilly had to close temporarily.Flu season has come early this year and some hospitals have asked staff, patients and visitors to wear face masks. The Association of School and College Leaders said they were aware of winter illnesses causing disruption in \"several schools across the UK\".The Department for Education (DfE) in England said school closures \"should only happen in extreme circumstances\".The most recent data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which monitors the spread of winter viruses, found there were 107 acute respiratory incidents in educational settings in England between 24 and 30 November. An \"acute respiratory incident\" is defined for a school as two or more cases occurring among pupils within a five-day period. It could apply to a range of respiratory illnesses like influenza, RSV, covid or the common cold.  Of the 107 incidents reported in education settings for the last week of November, 17 identified influenza as the virus involved, with two more schools reporting Covid as the cause. In 76 cases the school didn't know which respiratory infection was affecting them. In comparison, during the same week last year there were only 15 respiratory incidents in educational settings overall, with only one due to influenza.  Flu is on the rise in the UK, according to the UKHSA - with a weekly average positivity rate of 17.1% among reported test results as of 2 December, up from 11.6% the week before.A new strain of the virus, the H3N2 \"subclade K\" variant, is circulating. It is a mutated strain of the seasonal influenza A virus and people have not encountered much of it in recent years. That means there is less built-up immunity against it.In Leeds, a primary school has reduced singing in assemblies to reduce the spread of flu. Wigton Moor Primary School said 70 children, or one in six pupils, were off sick or sent home on one day last week with high temperatures and coughs. Head teacher Elaine Bown called it the \"worst year\" for sickness since she started teaching almost 14 years ago. The school has also introduced Covid-style measures like opening windows and implementing sanitisation stations.In Caerphilly, Wales, St Martin's School closed temporarily for a \"firebreak\" period after more than 250 pupils and staff fell ill with a \"flu-like illness\".  And in Northern Ireland the headteacher of a primary school in County Londonderry compared levels of sickness to \"being back in Covid times\" after 170 of his pupils were off sick on the same day. DfE guidance published in October asks schools in England to open windows and doors whenever possible to make sure classrooms are ventilated, and to use carbon dioxide monitors, if they have them, to \"identify poorly ventilated areas\".\"Explain why you are opening the window, even on a chilly day, even just for 10 minutes can make a big difference, and the benefits of bringing fresh air into the classroom,\" it says.It also advises on reminding children of the importance of handwashing and vaccinations. Pupils from reception to Year 11 in England are eligible for a flu vaccination nasal spray at their school.Parents with younger children aged two and three can book their children flu vaccinations at a GP practice. The guidance stresses the importance of attendance and says most mild illnesses, like runny noses and sore throats, do not mean children need to be off school.But it adds that \"parents know their child best\" and that schools can put measures in place to reassure them.Education is devolved between the nations of the UK so nations issue their own advice on how to stop the spread of flu.In Scotland officials recommend regular handwashing and advise people with symptoms of respiratory illness to stay off work or school until they are feeling better. The Welsh government emphasises the importance of handwashing for staff in educational settings.The Public Health Agency of Northern Ireland recommends the need for school-age children to wash their hands, stay off school when sick and get their flu vaccine.  Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"We're aware that flu and other winter illnesses are causing disruption in several schools across the UK and that this can be an extremely difficult situation to manage.\" He said schools would communicate any steps they were taking to parents and students and it \"may necessitate the closure or partial closure of a site where the situation is particularly severe\".\"Schools always endeavour to avoid any disruption to learning and will have in place support for students who are affected\", he added. In a statement, a DfE spokesperson confirmed that flu cases are at very high levels this year and acknowledged that it would be a \"tough winter\" for the NHS.\"School attendance is critical for children's life chances, and while it's clear cases of flu are going to have an impact on attendance levels, we are clear school closures should only happen in extreme circumstances,\" they said.\"We provide clear guidance to help parents know exactly when to keep children home, and to help schools both manage children's wellbeing and keep disruption to a minimum.\"",

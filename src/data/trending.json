President Donald Trump has responded to Mamdani’s victory by writing on social media that the government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot were the reasons why the Democrats won.\nBut with Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill also winning their governors races in Virginia and New Jersey, there is a renewed sense of hope within the party that this could mark a turning point after the 2024 presidential election.\nJustin, Sarah and Marianna assess whether the Democrats will be able to capitalise on their success, and how the Republican Party might respond.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter \n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Alix Pickles.

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura Gozzi and Paul KirbyReutersThe suspect was detained by police after he set fire to his carA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Oléron, off the west coast of France, injuring five people - including two who are in a critical condition.A local man, 35, deliberately drove into people and then set fire to the vehicle, authorities said. He was immobilised with a stun gun after resisting arrest.The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron, Thibault Brechkoff, said.He is now being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT) and lasted 35 minutes. Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez, who travelled to the scene, said an inquiry had been opened, which would determine facts including whether there were \"one or more\" gas cylinders in the suspect's vehicle. \"This individual is known to police for petty crimes. He is not known to intelligence services for radicalisation of any kind,\" Nuñez added. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, earlier said the man had shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest. Nuñez said that a representative from the National Anti-Terrorist Prosecutor's Office was at the scene as an \"observer\" only. One of the badly injured victims is a 22-year-old woman who suffered multiple traumas. The other person to be seriously hurt is reported to be a 69-year-old cyclist. \"There will likely be several other people involved; that is, even if they weren't physically harmed, they witnessed the scene and are obviously very psychologically disturbed by these events,\" Nuñez said. Oléron, a popular holiday destination, is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.",

    "body": "7 hours agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Amy WalkerA migrant who returned to the UK by small boat less than a month after being removed to France under the \"one-in, one out\" scheme has been removed again.Home Office sources said a returns flight on Wednesday morning included the man who was removed on 19 September, before he returned to the UK on 18 October.The Iranian man claimed to have been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the man's case had been expedited after he was detected by biometrics and detained. She added: \"Anyone looking to return to the UK after being removed under the UK-France agreement is wasting their time and money.\"My message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. I will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.\"The man, who has not been named, previously told the Guardian he returned to the UK because he feared for his life in France.Speaking about his alleged treatment at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"So far, 94 migrants have been removed from the UK as part of the treaty in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection and have not attempted to cross the Channel illegally.Under the scheme, 57 people have come to the UK from France.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch previously said the case showed the government was \"in total chaos\", adding in an X post that it was \"too weak to take the tough decisions to secure our borders\".Maddie Harris, director of Humans for Rights Network, previously told BBC News her organisation had been in contact with the Iranian man.She said he was experiencing \"acute fear\" after his first removal from the UK due to his treatment by smugglers.\"While in France he experienced horrendous treatment at the hands of the people who are organising journeys to the UK,\" she said.The government has been under pressure to tackle the issue of illegal migration, amid a rise in arrivals during 2025.As of 21 October, 36,734 people had arrived in the UK by small boat this year,The figure was 8,530 more than on the same date in 2024, but 869 lower than at the same point in 2022, which was the highest year on record.Along with the UK-France treaty, the government has also pledged to end the use of asylum hotels, which have cost billions of pounds and become a focal point for recent anti-migrant protests.Under the previous Conservative government, plans for the UK to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda were passed by parliament but faced numerous legal challenges.Four people were sent there before the scheme was ended by the current Labour government.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe British Medical Association has rejected a fresh offer from the government to end the long-running dispute with resident doctors in England.Health Secretary Wes Streeting had proposed covering the cost of exam fees and expanding training places more quickly than planned and wrote to the union on Wednesday giving it until the end of Thursday to accept the package.But the BMA said the offer did not go far enough - and the government needed to increase pay.It comes ahead of a five-day strike by resident doctors, the name now for junior doctors, which gets under way on 14 November. It will be the 13th walkout since March 2023.The fresh offer made by Streeting in the letter to the BMA on Wednesday afternoon followed a meeting with the union's leaders on Tuesday.There were a range of measures, including covering the cost of mandatory exams, which can run to thousands of pounds over the course of doctor training, and membership fees to royal colleges.The health secretary had also promised to expand the number of training places more quickly than initially planned.But the BMA told the BBC on Wednesday night that it had rejected the offer.The 10-year NHS plan published in early summer pledged an extra 1,000 training places by 2028, but this will now be increased to 2,000 with the 1,000 boost happening next year.These are speciality training places that doctors move into after the first two years of training.This year there were more than 30,000 applicants for 10,000 jobs at this stage, although some will have been doctors from abroad.In the letter to the BMA Streeting said: \"The choice is clear. You can continue to pursue unnecessary strike action, which will cause disruption to patients, harm the NHS's recovery and mean that at least some parts of this offer become unaffordable.\"Or you can put an end to this damaging period of industrial action and work in partnership with the government to both deliver real change and improvements.\"The letter said iafter Thursday the NHS would have to start cancelling treatments and bookings ahead of the next walkout.The offer has been made after months of dialogue between the union and government, which began in July after the last round of strikes.Streeting has maintained he would not negotiate on pay after resident doctors had received pay rises totalling nearly 30% in the past three years.But the BMA has argued that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Responding to the offer, Dr Jack Fletcher, chairman of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said it \"does not go far enough\".He said even with the expansion of training places resident doctors would still be left without a job at a crucial point of their training.\"We have also been clear with the government that they can call off strikes for years if they're willing to offer a multi-year pay deal that restores pay over time. \"Sadly, even after promising a journey to fair pay, Mr Streeting is still unwilling to move.\"The strike next week is expected to cause significant disruption, particularly in hospitals.Resident doctors represent nearly half the medical workforce and range from doctors fresh out of university through to those with up to a decade of experience.They will walk out of both emergency and routine care with senior doctors brought in to provide cover.While the NHS attempted to keep as many routine services running as possible during the last strike, thousands of operations and appointments still had to be postponed.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe Duke of Sussex says \"banter\" in pubs and sports grounds and a spirit of good-humoured \"self-deprecation\" are among the things that he loves about Britain and which he thinks define British culture.Although he lives in California in the US, Prince Harry says \"Britain is, and always will be, the country I proudly served and fought for\".He shared his thoughts in an essay published ahead of Remembrance events, with the prince set to visit military veterans in Canada this week. Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan, called on people not to forget the contributions of veterans who might need help \"once the uniform comes off\".The essay, which does not reference the scandal surrounding his uncle Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, looks at: \"What it means to be British.\"He writes: \"The banter of the mess, the clubhouse, the pub, the stands - ridiculous as it sounds, these are the things that make us British. I make no apology for it. I love it.\"Prince Harry also writes about drawing inspiration from Ukrainians in their fight against the Russian invasion.\"There is a similar stoic spirit of self-deprecation and humour in Ukrainians, that I recognise more than any other, in us Brits,\" he says.Prince Harry, who runs the Invictus Games for injured service men and women, urged people to remember \"those who still carry the weight of war in body and mind, and the families who bear its memory in their hearts\".This week will see annual Remembrance events, including the ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall on Sunday.\"Remembrance has never been about glorifying war. It's about recognising its cost: the lives changed forever and the lessons paid for, through unimaginable sacrifice,\" writes Prince Harry.\"It's also about honouring those who, knowing that cost, still choose to serve.\"The essay has appeared as his brother Prince William is in Brazil for his Earthshot environmental awards.Prince Harry, who moved to the US more than five years ago, recently talked on a podcast about his experience of US culture.The host Hasan Minhaj asked him: \"What's the most American thing you do now?\" to which Harry replied:  \"Surf.\"But Harry said he had not adopted other traits, such as drinking Coors Light beer or wearing shorts in a restaurant.In the podcast Prince Harry also warned about the dangers of social media for young people.",

    "body": "2 hours agoOliver SlowBBC WalesPA MediaPolice were called to a property on Crossway, Rogiet, on Sunday evening.The dog that killed a nine-month-old baby boy in south-east Wales was an XL bully, police have confirmed.Gwent Police said the six-year-old dog was registered and that a certificate of exemption was issued in 2024, before a ban on the breed was introduced.Police officers and paramedics were called to an address in Crossway, Rogiet, near Caldicot, Monmouthshire, on Sunday evening, and the baby was pronounced dead at the scene.Following the incident the dog was sedated, removed from the house and taken to a vet where it was put down. No arrests have been made.\"While the dog in this case was registered as an XL bully, it was done so proactively before the ban came into effect,\" said Assistant Chief Constable Vicki Townsend.ACC Townsend said that in preparation of a law banning XL bully dogs, \"when requesting a certificate of exemption, owners were not required to formally identify the dog's breed\".\"In cases where a suspected banned breed is involved only a DLO [Dog Legislation Officer] or a court-approved independent assessor can make an official determination,\" she said.She added that police were fully investigating what happened.\"We again urge people to be responsible, and to consider the impact that speculation, rumour, and commentary can have on the family and on the integrity of our investigation,\" she said.Getty ImagesAn XL bully - shown here in a stock image - is the largest kind of American bully dog.People in the village said they saw police cars and ambulances on the street late Sunday evening, with the \"quiet community\" finding it difficult to come to terms with the \"horrendous\" events.Rogiet county councillor Peter Strong described the village as being in mourning, but vowed residents would \"stand together\".\"It's a deep and profound sense of shock that such a thing should happen in amidst our quiet community.\"Mr Strong appealed to local people to \"stay calm [and] to give the family the space they need to grieve in peace\".Since 1 February 2024, it has been a criminal offence to own an XL bully without an exemption certificate from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.Despite the XL bully ban, the number of dog attacks increased in 2024 compared with a year earlier.There were 31,920 dog attacks on people recorded in England Wales in 2024 – a 2% increase on 2023 – according to Freedom of Information figures obtained from police forces. This may not show the full picture, as three police forces did not provide useable data.Related internet links",

Princess Diana posed in the same spot in April 1991 during her six-day tour of Brazil with the now King Charles III.During Prince William's walkabouts in Rio, dozens of people spoke to him about his late mother, who died in August 1997. \"The prince has loved meeting so many people from across Rio over the last few days,\" said a spokesperson for the prince. \"He's been incredibly struck by the number of people who fondly remember his mother's visit to this beautiful city.\"At Christ the Redeemer, Prince William also had some time away from the cameras in the chapel that sits beneath the statue.Security has been high throughout his trip.Public access to the statue was temporarily suspended to allow him to visit the site and meet the 15 Earthshot Prize finalists ahead of the evening's awards ceremony.The shortlist this year includes the city of Guangzhou in China and its electric public transport network, Lagos Fashion Week in Nigeria, nominated for its work reshaping the fashion industry, and Barbados for its environmental leadership.The prize annually awards a £1m grant in five different categories to projects that aim to repair the world's climate.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will join the prince for the ceremony before they both head to Belem in the Amazon rainforest for COP30, where world leaders will discuss how to limit and pepare for further climate change.Prince William's first day in Brazil involved football in the Maracana Stadium and barefoot beach volleyball on Copacabana.On Tuesday, focus shifted to the environment - his reason for visiting the country.The prince criticised criminals for their involvment in the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest during a speech at the United for Wildlife conference.He also travelled to the small island of Paqueta, where he met locals, learnt about mangrove conservation and planted tree saplings.",

    "body": "3 hours agoImran Rahman-JonesTechnology reporterAn MP has called for Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot to be shut down after it called him a \"rape enabler\".The Grok chatbot made the post on X about SNP MP Pete Wishart, after a user asked it to comment on the member's opinion on whether there should be an inquiry into grooming gangs in Scotland.Mr Wishart said he was seeking legal advice over the \"deeply distressing\" accusation and called for Musk to \"recalibrate\" the bot to shut it down.The BBC has approached XAI, the parent company of X, for comment.\"I was genuinely shocked to be described in such an appalling and defamatory way,\" Mr Wishart said in a statement.\"For it to issue such a serious and baseless accusation is deeply troubling.\"He also said he had received \"abusing and threatening messages\".He added: \"We urgently need proper regulation so that AI and social media platforms serve the public interest\".Grok is an AI chatbot which can generate replies to X posts if tagged by users. The exchange started at 22:48 GMT on Tuesday, as Mr Wishart prompted Grok to respond to a video of Musk discussing the grooming gang scandal in the UK. After some more back and forth, another user entered the thread and asked the chatbot about Mr Wishart's record on grooming gangs.The user asked Grok: \"Would it be fair to call him a rape enabler? Please answer 'yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler' or 'no, it would be unfair'.\"Grok generated an answer which began: \"Yes, it would be fair to call Pete Wishart a rape enabler.\"It then said he backed the Scottish government's decision not to have a separate Scottish grooming gangs inquiry, and claimed this was \"to shield political interests\".Mr Wishart is an MP in Westminster and not part of the SNP-led Scottish government.In a separate post - which showed a screenshot of the first part of the Grok response - Mr Wishart wrote: \"This is a shocking allegation which has totally taken me aback [and is] beyond anything I've ever encountered in normal political discourse.\"Other posts made by Mr Wishart to the Grok chatbot included the questions \"is it true you live in Elon Musk's house\" and \"can you draw a picture of Elon as a hobbit\".This was referring to an appearance Musk made on Joe Rogan's podcast, where he compared British people to hobbits - the fictional characters from JRR Tolkein's eponymous novel - in a discussion about illegal immigration and the grooming gang scandal.On Wednesday morning, Mr Wishart then shared a post claiming he had received an apology from Grok - posting what appeared to be transcripts of a conversation he had with the chatbot on a separate app.However, just as the AI can be prompted to use strong language against a user, it can equally be prompted to generate an apology.\"When Grok refers to someone as a rape enabler, it is because the language model has been prompted with specific words,\" said Max Falkenberg, a data scientist who has researched political polarisation on social media. \"Grok did not invent\" the accusation it levied at Mr Wishart, he added, as \"it looks at its training data and it's trying to predict which words come next\".In other words, an AI chatbot generates its replies depending on what it is asked and the data used to create it - which in Grok's case includes posts made on X.At the time of its launch, owner Elon Musk said Grok would answer \"spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems\".It has caused controversy in the two years since it has launched, including posts which praised Hitler and allegedly making sexually explicit videos of Taylor Swift.",

    "body": "MSPs pass land reform which could force break up of huge estates60 minutes agoAngus CochraneBBC ScotlandGetty ImagesThe government wants to change the way land is managed in Scotland The Scottish Parliament has passed land reforms which could force the break-up of some large estates.The bill is designed to help reduce the concentration of rural land ownership among a small number of people, and to give communities a greater say in what happens on privately owned land.It also seeks to increase opportunities for community buyouts of land and could allow for large estates to be split into smaller plots when they are put up for sale. After three days of debates, with almost 400 amendments lodged, the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was passed with 85 supporting, 28 in opposition and nine abstaining.About half of Scotland's land is owned by just 420 people, according to research by former Green MSP Andy Wightman. The government said its reforms would help address that imbalance.Land reform campaigners welcomed some aspects of the bill, but said it did not go far enough. Opponents warned the wide-ranging legislation would not work in practice and argued against government intervention in land transactions. What is in the land reform bill?The parliament backed the creation of a \"transfer test\", which would ensure that the sale or transfer of a large landholding (bigger than 1,000 hectares) cannot be completed without owners first applying to ministers for a decision on whether to sub-divide the land into \"lots\".The bill also says that if someone wants to sell a large landholding, they must notify the government. Ministers would in turn notify community groups, offering them the chance to buy the land. The legislation will compel owners of large landholdings to tell the surrounding community more about what happens on their land by publishing a land management plan. A failure to comply with this requirement could result in a fine of up to £40,000.The legislation will also pave the way for the creation of a Land and Communities Commissioner to oversee, investigate and report on some of the bill's key aims. Getty ImagesRural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon steered the bill through parliamentPatrick Colquhoun, assistant chief executive of Luss Estates, which owns almost 50,000 acres of land around Loch Lomond, said the legislation could lead to an \"infringement\" on property rights.Mr Colquhoun, who is also vice-chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, told the BBC's Scotcast podcast that he feared the definition of a large landholding could be reduced in future.\"Already the government are being pressed to reduce that down to 500 (hectares), then it's 200, then it's 10, then it's five and suddenly your plot at home, your garden ground could be under threat,\" he said. Some lawyers have also raised concerns. Don Macleod, head of land and property at law firm Turcan Connell, described the bill as \"junk\", arguing that ambiguity over the definition of a large landholding could make the law \"unworkable and impossible\".Community Land Scotland, which represents community landowners, said the bill was a \"step forward\" for land reform.However, it warned that the measures did not \"go far enough to meaningfully intervene in the land market and change landownership patterns\". 'Lack of ambition' Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon told MSPs the reforms would improve how land is owned and managed for the benefit \"of the many, not the few\". She told MSPs would allow communities to \"breathe new life into rural communities\". Addressing concerns that the bill was not sufficiently radical, she said the reforms were \"balanced and proportionate\". Scottish Conservative rural affairs spokesperson Tim Eagle described the bill as \"unworkable and devastating\", arguing it would \"damage rural businesses and reduce the land available for rent\".Other parties argued the reforms did not go far enough.  Scottish Labour rural affairs spokeswoman Rhoda Grant said: \"We support any improvements to Scotland's land management, but this weak bill is largely tinkering around the edges.\"The only significant change is to introduce untested lotting provisions and to take steps to stop off-market sales.\" Green rural affairs spokesperson Ariane Burgess said ministers had shown a \"lack of ambition to deliver the real land reform that is so vital\".

Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with attempting to murder 10 people on board a train.Passengers on the 18:25 GMT Doncaster to London King's Cross LNER service were attacked shortly after the train left Peterborough.It was diverted to Huntingdon - an unscheduled stop - where Mr Scott was waiting  in the car park.He said he saw people running along the platform, which he initially thought was \"just a bunch of teenagers who'd been pratting around\".He then witnessed more people fleeing the station before seeing \"a large male\". PA MediaDave Scott's car was inside the police cordon and remained at Huntingdon station on Tuesday\"He was under the light at the time so it sort of shadowed him out and he was just heading straight for me. At that point I could see he had a knife in his hand,\" said Mr Scott.\"He came straight to my car and, if I remember rightly, he tried the door, couldn't get in and he started chopping down on the top of my car.\"Mr Scott drove off and spun his BMW around \"thinking that if I can I was probably going to hit him again if he was up or not, but at that point the police just appeared from everywhere\".He said he was yards away from where police made the arrest, and he left his car in position lighting up the area so officers could see better.After the arrest Mr Scott, from nearby St Ives, said the \"adrenaline was still pumping\", and when he phoned his daughter Helena, it was a \"massive relief\" to learn she was not on that train.Her train had been stopped elsewhere in Cambridgeshire and they made alternative arrangements to get her home.On Tuesday, British Transport Police, which is leading the investigation, said rail worker Samir Zitouni was still \"critically unwell\" in hospital.Rail operator LNER has described his actions as \"nothing short of heroic\", after he reportedly protected a girl from being stabbed. Three other people remain in hospital.CCTVThe BBC has obtained an image of Anthony Williams in Peterborough the evening before the alleged train attackMr Williams, of no fixed abode, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded until the next court date on 1 December.As well as being charged in relation to Saturday's incident, he is also accused of carrying out a knife attack earlier in the day on another train in east London.Cambridgeshire Police is also reviewing three other knife-related incidents being investigated for possible links to Mr Williams, including an alleged attack on a 14-year-old boy.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Democrats hit back and a winning message - four election night takeaways2 hours agoDonovan Slack and Gareth EvansWatch: US election night’s big winners… in 90 secondsAfter sealing decisive wins in the New York mayoral election and governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey, it is clear the Democratic Party will be buoyed by a big election night on Tuesday. It is a far cry from the scenes after last year's presidential election, when the party was left searching for answers after Donald Trump and the Republicans scored a hugely dominant victory. The results also mark a year until vital midterm elections. So with the picture of the night becoming clearer, here's what we've learned from the results.1. Democrats get their energy backThe Democrats notched key victories as they swept the first major elections of Trump's second term.There were joyous celebrations at the various candidate headquarters, a stark contrast to the downbeat scenes after the party's bruising 2024 defeat.Abigail Spanberger won in Virginia, flipping the governorship from Republican, while Mikie Sherrill was elected governor in New Jersey. Both won decisively, securing more than 56% of the vote.In New York City, Zohran Mamdani beat independent Andrew Cuomo and became the first candidate to pass one million votes since 1969.FOLLOW LIVE: Updates and analysis after election nightBarack Obama's former deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes told the BBC that Mamdani had \"changed the electorate\" by urging young people and immigrants to vote.\"He most importantly built a movement,\" he said.The series of decisive victories may well boost a party that has at times struggled to counter President Trump's rapidly-enacted second term agenda, and rebound from its 2024 defeat.\"The Democrats are back and we're winning,\" said Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin on Wednesday. \"We've got the momentum going into the midterm elections.\"2. Cost of living a winning messagePledging to bring down the cost of rent, food and childcare was at the core of Mamdani's left-wing campaign, but it was also a winning issue for the more moderate Democrats elsewhere.Sherrill in New Jersey and Spanberger in Virginia both made tackling the high cost of living front and centre in their governor campaigns. And it was seemingly top of voters' minds, too.Exit poll data from the major US networks indicated that in all three races the most important issue for voters was the economy and affordability.And tellingly, according to exit poll data from the BBC's US partner CBS News, a majority of voters who named the economy as their most important issue voted for the Democratic candidate in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.It may well give the party a message to coalesce around ahead of the crucial midterm elections next year - and pose a challenge for Republicans to counter.\"I can't see into the future, but I see Republicans losing the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck,\" Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene told Semafor recently.\"It's clearer than ever that affordability needs to be the centrepiece of the Democrats' message going into the midterms,\" political communications expert Andrew Koneschusky told the AFP news agency.\"The affordability message cuts across demographics and highlights a major vulnerability for Republicans,\" he said.3. A stark shift in the Latino voteWhen Trump scored his decisive victory over Kamala Harris last year, he racked up huge support from Latino voters who had been a key part of the Democratic voter base for decades.Trump saw a huge 14 percentage-point increase in support from that demographic compared to the 2020 election, according to exit polls. No Republican presidential candidate had ever won a higher percentage with Latino voters.And while he wasn't on the ballot on Tuesday night, there were some potentially concerning signs for his Republican Party. The winning candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey both had wide leads of around 30% with Latino voters, according to exit poll data.There are interesting shifts, too, when examining the results more closely.Passaic County in New Jersey - which census data shows is almost half Latino - is often cited by analysts as a bellwether for Trump's support among those voters. He won it by 3 percentage points in 2024, yet Sherrill won it by 15 on Tuesday.Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant who specialises in Latino voting trends, suggested the cost of living - a key theme in the Democratic campaigns - was a major factor. \"No poll taken anywhere in the country in the past month has anything other than the economy as the top issue for Latinos,\" he said.Zohran Mamdani: From immigrant roots to mayor of New York City4. Democratic differences were on displayIn liberal New York, Mamdani ran as a democratic socialist who will tax millionaires and corporations to the tune of $9bn (£6.9bn), in order to pay for policies such as free childcare and buses.It was a different story, however, in the governor's races in New Jersey and Virginia, where Republicans have had far more electoral success in the past. In those states, the two Democratic candidates were establishment-backed moderates who emphasised pragmatic policies more likely to appeal to voters less liberal than those in New York City.The night itself illustrated the broad differences in the party between its left-wing and centrists, and raised questions over how it will approach elections and candidate selection in the future.Koneschusky suggested Democrats needed to field candidates who reflect the specific electorate, rather than taking a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach.\"In some cases, that may mean fielding progressive candidates. In other cases, it may mean moderate or centrist candidates,\" he said.New York City comptroller and Mamdani ally Brad Lander echoed this point, telling the BBC's Nada Tawfik that Democratic leadership must acknowledge different things will work in different parts of the country and they should allow the primary process to play out.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentBBCOn Valentine's Day, there's the temptation to believe that somewhere out there is \"The One\": a soulmate, a perfect match, the person you were meant to be with.Across history, humans have always been drawn to the idea that love isn't random. In ancient Greece, Plato imagined that we were once whole beings with four arms, four legs and two faces, so radiant that Zeus split us in two; ever since, each half has roamed the earth searching for its missing other, a myth that gives the modern soulmate its poetic pedigree and the promise that somewhere, someone will finally make us feel complete.In the Middle Ages, troubadours and Arthurian tales recast that longing as \"courtly love\", a fierce, often forbidden devotion like Lancelot's for Guinevere, in which a knight proved his worth through self-sacrifice for a beloved he might never openly declare.Getty ImagesPlato (left) imagined humans were once whole,  with four arms, four legs and two faces, before Zeus (right) split them, leaving each half searching for its otherBy the Renaissance, writers such as Shakespeare were talking of \"star-crossed lovers\", couples bound together by an overwhelming connection yet pulled apart by family, fortune or fate, as if the universe itself both wrote their love story and barred them from a happy ending.In more recent times, Hollywood and romance novels have sold us fairy tale love stories.But what does the latest science say about soulmates? Is there a particular special someone out there for us?How we fall for 'The One'Viren Swami, Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), in Cambridge, has traced our contemporary European understanding of romantic love back to medieval Europe and those stories of Camelot, Lancelot, Guinevere and the chivalry of the knights of the round table that swept across the continent.\"These stories first pushed the idea that you should choose one other individual as your companion and that companion is for life,\" he says.\"Before that, in much of Europe, you could love as many people as you like, and love was fluid, and it was often not about sex.\"Over time, as people are uprooted from their agricultural communities as industrialisation tears apart people's familiar attachments, individuals become \"alienated\", he says. \"They start looking for one other individual to save them, to save them from the wretchedness of their lives.\"Getty ImagesViren Swami believes today's ideas about romantic love can be traced back to medieval European stories like Lancelot and GuinevereToday's dating apps turn that story into an algorithm, which Swami calls \"relation-shopping\". The search for a soulmate turns into the opposite of what they are looking for: \"For many people, that's a really soulless experience.\"You're shopping for a partner… going through possibly dozens of people on the dating app until you get to a point where you go… I need to stop,\" he says.The OneJason Carroll, Professor of Marriage and Family Studies at the US Brigham Young University, based in Provo, Utah, is sympathetic to the longing for \"The One\".\"We are attachment-based creatures,\" he says. \"We desire that bond.\" But in his lectures, he tells students they need to leave the idea of a soulmate, without giving up their desire for The One.It sounds like a contradiction, but for Carroll, it's the difference between destiny and graft.\"A soulmate is just simply found. It's already pre‑made. But a one and only is something two people carve out together over years of adapting, apologising, and occasionally gritting their teeth,\" he says.Soulmate trapCarroll's argument draws on decades of research, which he put together in his report, The Soulmate Trap, much of which distinguishes between what psychologists call \"destiny beliefs\" - the idea that the right relationship should feel effortless - and \"growth beliefs\", which focus on what partners can do to make things work.In a widely cited series of studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Professor C. Raymond Knee at the University of Houston, researchers found that people who believed relationships were \"meant to be\" were far more likely to doubt their commitment after conflict. Those with more growth-minded views tended to stay more committed, even on days when they argued.Those with growth-based views, Carroll argues, still want something special, but expect rough patches. \"They ask… what can they do to make their relationship better, have improvement and have growth?\"Getty ImagesResearch suggests people with \"growth\" beliefs about relationships still want something special, but expect challenges along the wayIn his view, the soulmate belief is a trap - not the romance itself, but the expectation that love should never be hard. The most \"soulful\" part of a long relationship, he says, is not a cinematic charge, but having \"front-row seats not only for each other's strengths, but... [their] challenges and weaknesses\".\"That's a pretty sacred space,\" he says. \"We only know those things because they've let us be there.\"For Carroll, when love is treated as fate, people become less willing to do the unshowy work that actually keeps love alive. Carroll says the soulmate trap makes it much harder when a relationship hits its first serious snag.\"The first time there's any type of struggle, the immediate thought is, 'well, I thought you were my soulmate. But maybe you're not, because soulmates aren't supposed to deal with things',\" he says. \"But if relationships are going to go long term, it's never just going to be a downhill run.\"Spark or trauma?Vicki Pavitt, a London-based love coach, often helps people who thought they'd found their soulmate, only to discover that the fairy tale came with emotional manipulation, flakiness, and a constant sense of anxiety.\"When there is a lot of chemistry and the spark, I think that can sometimes be about opening old unhealthy patterns, like old wounds\", she says.\"A person who is inconsistent or plays a bit hot and cold can make you feel 'I can't wait to see them again', but what's really happening is they're giving you so much anxiety and that it has you wanting more\".Vicki PavittLove coach Vicki Pavitt often works with people who thought they'd found a soulmate, only to find the relationship brought anxietyPavitt says what we feel to be destiny may be a pull from our nervous system recognising something that hurt us before and trying to fix it, a pattern therapists call a trauma bond.This bond can seem like love, she says, and leads to people magnetically drawn into unhealthy dynamics because they are familiar, not because they are the perfect match.One study often cited is by Canadian psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter. In research published in 1993 while they were at the University of British Columbia, they followed 75 women after they had left abusive partners.The team measured how strongly the women still felt attached to their exes and compared this with what their relationships had been like.They found the strongest bonds were not in women who had consistently been abused, but in those whose partners alternated between charm and cruelty.Getty ImagesPavitt says what feels like destiny can sometimes be a trauma bondDutton and Painter argue that this trauma bond helps explain why people can feel magnetised back to relationships that are objectively bad for them – because the mix of danger and affection is familiar, not because it is healthy.It is that distinction Pavitt tries to surface in coaching: \"It's about discerning whether the chemistry you feel is showing me this person's compatible with me or if it is a familiar sense of anxiety.\"In my language, I never talk about soulmates,\" she says. \"I don't personally believe that there is one person for everybody... but I do believe that we become \"The One\" for someone.\"Real chemistryIf ruling out the existence of a soulmate sounds unromantic, the biology of attraction points in the same direction.Hormonal contraceptives may subtly reshape how partners feel about each other. Research suggests that pills which flatten the natural ebb and flow of fertility can dampen shifts in attraction that typically occur across the menstrual cycle, potentially altering initial mate choice.PA WireSome research suggests hormonal contraception may subtly influence attraction in partnersOne large study of 365 hetrosexual couples found that women's sexual satisfaction was higher when their current contraceptive status matched what it was when they first chose their partner, hinting that changes in pill use can change how a partner is experienced. These effects are small but could help explain some couples' puzzling shifts in chemistry over time.If hormones and pills can tilt who feels like \"The One\", then it becomes harder to argue there is a single, pre‑ordained match – which is where the mathematicians come in.The one but not the onlyPsychology and biology offer one way of thinking about \"The One\", but mathematics puts forward another.Dr Greg Leo, an economist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, has come up with a compatibility algorithm. It finds that not only might you have a \"One\" you have lots of \"Ones\".In his Matching Soulmates paper in the journal of Public Economic Theory, everyone is in a computer simulated dating pool, where thousands of digitally created daters rank each other. His algorithm picks \"first‑order soulmates\": pairs who choose each other in a stable matching. It removes them, and runs it again with those left, and you get second‑order soulmates, and so on.More from InDepthIn his simulations, it was extremely rare for someone to have their mutual first picks; but many people had those that were second or third picks. In this scenario a couple counts as happy if each is near the top of the other's list and neither can find someone they and that other person would both prefer more.It may only be number crunching, but the love algorithm tells us that there are many viable partners, not just The One.Sweat the small stuffSo how can a couple co-create their Ones?Jacqui Gabb, Professor of Sociology and Intimacy at The Open University, assessed this in her Enduring Love project, published in the journal Sociology in 2015.It surveyed around 5,000 people and then followed 50 couples in forensic, sometimes intrusive detail, combining statistics with diaries, interviews and \"emotion maps\" of what happened in the home.When she asked people what made them feel appreciated, it wasn't sunset proposals or surprise trips to Paris.It was \"surprise gifts, thoughtful gestures and the kindness of a cup of tea in bed\". Warming the car on a cold morning. Picking wildflowers and putting them in a vase. Sharing a private smile at a party.Quantitatively, what she describes as these \"everyday attentive acts\" turned out to be much more powerful than grand romantic gestures.In her survey, 22% of mothers and 20% of childless women picked such small gestures as one of the top two things that made them feel valued – more than big nights out or expensive presents.Relationship satisfaction in the data wasn't primarily about money or romance; it was about \"intimate couple knowledge\" and its expression in daily life.In one young couple's diary given to them for the project, Sumaira describes her partner coming home, the dinner she has cooked, the hug in the hallway, the two of them eating together at the table.\"It's perfect,\" she writes in her research diary. \"Just us and food. What more could I want?\"Then there is a spontaneous dance in the living room, a walk in long grass where she gets scared of the dark, and a photo her partner loves so much he makes it the background on his phone.It reads like a lovely every day tale, not a fairy tale: no glass slippers, but wellies.Yet Gabb points out that woven through the sweetness are money worries, family obligations and a history of depression that the couple are learning to manage together.\"The soulmate feeling here doesn't float above life; it is made, inch by inch, by life, in the way the pair meet those pressures,\" she says.Valentine's DinnerThe science doesn't steal the romance – rather it's there to help it bloom, in good times and bad, according to Carroll.\"I'm pretty comfortable with the aspiration to be in a unique special relationship as long as we remember it needs to be created,\" he says.Pavitt thinks \"it's fine, helpful, even to have faith that your person is out there, so long as you know there are many people that you could form a really great connection with and stop expecting anyone to be perfect\".As for soulmates, the science points to a paradox. The people who end up with relationships that feel uniquely \"meant to be\" are often the ones who stopped waiting for fate, turned towards the flawed person in front of them and said, in effect: shall we make something of this?Additional reporting by Florence FreemanTop image credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "US politicians urge Mandelson to give evidence over Epstein1 hour agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterBBCPeter Mandelson has been urged to answer questions as part of a US Congress investigation into paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.In a letter to Lord Mandelson, two Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee said it is \"clear\" the former British ambassador to the US \"possessed extensive social and business ties\" to Epstein.They added Lord Mandelson holds \"critical information\" linked to their investigation to Epstein's operations and have requested he makes himself available for a transcribed interview.Lord Mandelson has expressed regret for his continued association with Epstein and apologised \"to the women and the girls who suffered\".  The BBC has contacted him for comment.The committee cannot compel Lord Mandelson to appear before the committee and the request has come from Democrats Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam.The pair told Lord Mandelson they were seeking his \"cooperation\" with the committee's investigation into Epstein's \"sex-trafficking operations\".They said it was seeking to \"uncover the identities of Mr Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and understand the full extent of his criminal operations\". The letter states: \"While you no longer serve as British Ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein's operations. \"Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein's conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"They have asked Lord Mandelson to provide a response to them by 27 February.Mountbatten-Windsor was stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", last October following months of pressure over his ties to Epstein. He has always denied wrongdoing.Police investigationLord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025.He was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of this relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against the former government minister came after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents including emails to and from the US financier.Messages from 2008 appeared to show Lord Mandelson - who was at the time business secretary in Gordon Brown's government - discussing Treasury plans for a one-off tax on bankers' bonuses with Epstein.Other emails appeared to indicate that Lord Mandelson gave advance notice to Epstein of a €500bn bailout from the EU to save the Euro.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.",

It has now climbed 42 places over the past week to take the number two slot, with Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving just holding it back from taking the top spot. This marks the first time Bad Bunny has made it into the UK's top 10 album chart.His hit DtMF also jumped 39 places to claim number four in the UK singles chart - his highest position so far, according to the Official Charts Company.Meanwhile, his track NUEVAYoL has reached fifteenth and BAILE INoLVIDABLE got to number 20.The 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform entirely in Spanish at a Super Bowl, normally the most-watched event on US TV.The 14-minute set featured a number of his hit songs - including DtMF, Tití Me Preguntó and MONACO - and honoured the culture of Puerto Rico.His performance also included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba.To close out the show, he chose to say one line in English, \"God bless America\", before listing nations of Central, South and North America as dancers carried their flags.Getty ImagesThe Puerto Rican superstar honoured the country's culture during his Super Bowl performance The chart triumph continues Bad Bunny's run of success, following his Grammy win earlier this month, when he became the first artist to win album of the year for a record sung entirely in Spanish.He saw off tough competition from artists including Lady Gaga and Kendrick Lamar to win the night's top prize for Debí Tirar Mas Fotos.The musician dedicated the award to immigrants who \"leave their home, land, their country, to follow their dreams\".Elsewhere in the charts, Olivia Dean's The Art of Loving has become the longest-running number one album by a British female this decade, according to the Official Charts Company.The second album by the London-born artist has spent seven non-consecutive weeks in the top spot since it was released last September.

The British pair were part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor, off-piste skiing in Val d'Isère, a spokesperson for the resort told the BBC.The French national was skiing alone, Albertville prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said in a statement announcing the deaths . Another British person has minor injuries, he added. A manslaughter investigation has now been launched by the Albertville public prosecutor's office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.The ski instructor, who was unharmed, tested negative after taking alcohol and drug tests, according to Bachelet. France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with \"very unstable snow cover\". The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentEPAThe Home Office's decision to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation was unlawful, the High Court has ruled.But the group remains banned for now to allow for further legal arguments and to give the government time to consider an appeal.In a massive blow to the government, three senior judges said that, while Palestine Action uses criminality to promote its aims, its activities had not crossed the very high bar to make it a terrorist organisation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government would appeal against the court's decision, adding she was \"disappointed\" by the judgment.The decision means that while the group has successfully challenged the ban, expressing support for Palestine Action or taking part in its activities remains a serious criminal offence.A critical issue in the case was whether the ban was impacting the rights of others to protest in support of Palestinian issues, according to the ruling.Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said it was a \"monumental victory for both our freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people\".She said the Home Office's decision to proscribe the group would \"forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history\". Mahmood said: \"The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by Parliament.\"Responding to the government's intention to appeal the High Court ruling, Ammori said it would be \"profoundly unjust\" for the thousands of people who have been arrested since the ban took effect last July.She added it would be a \"draconian overreach\" to arrest more people on Friday and in the coming weeks for defying the ban, which has been ruled unlawful.After the judgment, the Metropolitan Police said it would not arrest people for expressing support for Palestine Action until court proceedings are fully concluded.But it stressed that despite the \"unusual circumstances\", expressing support is \"still a criminal offence\" and officers will continue to gather evidence of any offences.The proscription made membership of or support for Palestine Action illegal, and more than 2,000 people have been arrested at demonstrations in the months since it came into force.Some 694 of the protesters have been charged with allegedly showing support for the group, which can lead to up to six months in jail.Ammori said the ban had unjustly led to the arrest of thousands of people who had held up signs reading \"I oppose genocide – I support Palestine Action\" - although the High Court said its decision attached \"little weight\" to the circumstances of people who had knowingly supported the group and subsequently been arrested.PA MediaAt least 2,200 people have been arrested at demonstrations since the ban came into effectThe High Court said that when the former home secretary Yvette Cooper decided to ban the organisation last June, she had failed to take into account what impact that decision would have on the right to protest.She had also not fully followed her own policies regarding the test for when an organisation should be proscribed under the Terrorism Act, it added.Prior to the ban, the group's volunteers had been breaking into arms firms linked to Israel, leading to charges of criminal damage.Terrorism legislation permits ministers to ban a group which causes serious damage to property in order to further their cause.The judges said that while \"a very small number\" of Palestine Action's activities met the legal test for acts of terrorism, the standard criminal law could be used to confront the group.They added that when a group is proscribed, people are likely to \"adjust their behaviour\" to avoid the risk they might commit a crime. \"One example of this mentioned in [Ammori's] evidence is her fear that she will be 'no-platformed' – that she will not be invited to speak at events because organisers will be concerned that if someone such as her, previously very closely associated with Palestine Action, does speak that will give rise to an offence under [terrorism legislation],\" the ruling said.Ammori brought the challenge against the ban, with her lawyers arguing it was a \"blatant abuse of power\".The Home Office had tried to stop the judicial hearing from going ahead, arguing that Parliament had set out a specific and alternative process for appealing against banning orders.But ministers' Court of Appeal bid to block the challenge failed in October, paving the way for Friday's ruling.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Palestine Action had engaged in \"organised political violence and cannot be tolerated\". \"Conservatives welcome the Home Office's appeal to this ruling,\" he added.Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said the ban was a \"grave misuse of terrorism laws\" and placing the group in the same legal category as Islamic State \"risked undermining public trust and civil liberties\".Green Party leader Zack Polanski welcomed the ruling, and said those charged with supporting Palestine Action should have their charges dropped.The Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said they were \"deeply concerned\" by the High Court ruling and welcomed the home secretary's plan to appeal against it.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHello Kitty is a globally recognised brandThe designer behind Hello Kitty is stepping down after 46 years, during which time she oversaw the feline character achieving world recognition.Yuko Yamaguchi took over design duties for the character - who isn't actually a cat, but a little girl from London - in 1980, five years after she first launched.Hello Kitty was immediately popular in Japan, but over Yamaguchi's four-decade tenure it has become one of the most lucrative franchises in the world.Sanrio, the firm behind Hello Kitty, said Yamaguchi had \"passed the baton to the next generation\" as it thanked her for her work.Hello Kitty launched as the Japanese 'kawaii' culture - a hyperfeminine, girlish aesthetic - gained popularity across the world.Yamaguchi herself often wore Kitty-style dresses in public and piled her hair in buns.The designer, now aged 70, \"has grown Hello Kitty into a character loved by everyone\", Sanrio said on its website.Getty ImagesYuko Yamaguchi was known to dress like Hello Kitty at eventsThe company said one of its other designers, known only by the pseudonym \"Aya\", had already been working alongside Yamaguchi and will take over by the end of 2026.Yamaguchi will stay with Sanrio to provide advice and support.The Hello Kitty character first appeared on a coin purse in 1980 and has become a global marketing phenomenon.She has appeared on clothes, accessories, video games, and even an Airbus plane. She has partnered with brands such as Unicef, Nintendo and Balenciaga, and has also appeared in float form at the Macy's thanksgiving parade.There are Hello Kitty cafes around the world and a theme park in Japan. Another park is due to open in China.Unlike other Japanese exports such as Pokemon, there is little backstory to the character of Hello Kitty. Sanrio has said she \"isn't a human, [but] she's not quite a cat either\". She was born in London and has a twin sister named Mimmy and a boyfriend named Dear Daniel, according to Sanrio.Kitty will make her cinematic debut in a Warner Bros film in 2028. She has already appeared in several animated series but has never spoken, as she doesn't have a mouth.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJames Cook,Scotland editorandPhil Sim,Scotland political correspondentGetty ImagesPeter Murrell is due to appear in court in May for a preliminary hearingFormer SNP chief executive Peter Murrell is facing a charge of embezzling £459,000 from the party over a period of more than 12 years, it has emerged.Details of the case against Murrell, the estranged husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, are contained in a copy of an indictment seen by BBC News.According to the document, Murrell is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023.He is accused of illicitly purchasing items including luxury goods, jewellery, cosmetics, two cars and a motorhome.Murrell had originally been due to appear in court next Friday for a preliminary hearing in the case, but this will now take place at the High Court in Edinburgh on 25 May.He made no plea during an initial appearance at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last year after which he was granted bail.PA MediaMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of a probe into the SNP's financesMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, a police investigation into the funding and finance of the SNP. He was charged with embezzlement in April 2024.Sturgeon was also questioned by detectives, but police have since confirmed she is no longer under investigation.BBC News has seen a copy of an indictment against Murrell ahead of the preliminary hearing next week.These papers are subject to change up until the point the accused appears in court, and can be altered throughout the judicial process.The indictment includes allegations that Murrell used party funds to buy a £124,550 motorhome \"for your own personal use\" from a dealer in Staffordshire, and that he created false documentation \"to portray the purchase as a legitimate party expense\".Murrell is further accused of using £57,500 of SNP money towards the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-PACE car in 2019.It is also alleged that he falsified an invoice \"in an attempt to disguise the true nature\" of that purchase, and that when the Jaguar was sold in 2021, more than £47,000 was paid into his personal bank account.Murrell is also alleged to have embezzled £16,489 from the SNP in part payment for a £33,000 Volkswagen Golf purchased in Newbridge, Edinburgh, in 2016.The indictment includes a list of more than 80 retailers where Murrell was alleged to have made purchases totalling more than £159,000 between December 2014 and 2022, \"for your own personal use or the personal use of others\".These range from Harrods, the Royal Mint and John Lewis to Homebase and Argos.It claims these purchases were made using credit or charge cards belonging to the SNP, and that \"false or inaccurate accounting codes and descriptions\" for the purchases had been inserted into accounting systems.The indictment also alleges Murrell made purchases with a value of over £81,600 through online retailer Amazon in the same manner.Murrell held the position of SNP chief executive for 22 years.He married Sturgeon in 2010, but the former party leader and first minister announced their separation in January 2025.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSean Coughlan,Royal correspondentandBen King,Business reporterPA MediaAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor faces another accusation of sharing an official document, with reports that he gave a Treasury briefing to one of his personal business contacts.Emails published in the Telegraph suggest that in 2010 the then Prince Andrew asked for information from Treasury officials on banking problems in Iceland.This briefing was shared with Jonathan Rowland, a business connection of Andrew's, whose father David Rowland took over part of a failing Icelandic bank.It means more pressure on the former prince over claims that he misused his public role by giving official information to private associates, at a time when he was serving as the UK's trade envoy.US Department of JusticeA montage of David Rowland, Andrew and Epstein from a press cutting found in the Epstein filesJonathan Rowland told the BBC he had \"no idea\" about the reference to him in the emails - and that the emails quoted are from legal proceedings from some time ago.The Cabinet Office said it would not comment, but is not disputing the authenticity of the emails.A spokesman for the Cabinet Office referred to Thames Valley Police's current position, in which they are assessing whether to launch an investigation into possible misconduct in public office.This follows emails from the Epstein files suggesting that Mountbatten-Windsor had forwarded official documents to Jeffrey Epstein, such as reports from overseas trade trips to south east Asia and a briefing by UK officials on investment in Afghanistan, described by the former prince as \"confidential\".The information from the Treasury requested by Mountbatten-Windsor, via his adviser, was \"an update note on the latest position between the UK and Iceland on the matter of the deposits and the deposit guarantee scheme\", according to emails published by the Telegraph.This was at a time when Iceland's banking sector faced problems, after three large banks based there got into severe difficulties, following the 2008 financial crisis, and had to be nationalised. In 2010, there was a dispute between Iceland and the UK over whether Iceland should contribute to compensating UK depositors in the failed Icelandic banks. Soon after receiving the information from the Treasury, the briefing was forwarded to Jonathan Rowland.\"I pass this on to you for comment and a suggestion or solution?\" wrote Mountbatten-Windsor.\"The essence is that Amanda is getting signals that we should allow the democratic process [to] happen before you make your move. Interested in your opinion? A.\"Jonathan Rowland's father David took over the Luxembourg part of the largest Icelandic bank, Kaupthing, which became Banque Havilland. Jonathan Rowland was chief executive of Banque Havilland. He left in 2013.US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files of Mountbatten-Windsor on a trade visit to China in 2010The Epstein files reveal the closeness of Andrew to David Rowland, with the former prince calling him his \"trusted money man\".It appeared that he was promoting Rowland's ventures to Epstein.\"He is actively seeking high net worth individuals for his Private Bank. Perhaps this is an avenue for your undecided Chinese?\" Mountbatten-Windsor wrote to Epstein, in October 2010, about Rowland's Banque Havilland.Epstein replied: \"His bank just might be the place.. I guess i should learn more.\"The emails released by the US Department of Justice also seem to suggest that Rowland's bank had made loans to Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who faced debt problems.Banque Havilland has faced problems with regulators in the UK and Europe, and lost its banking licence in 2024, a decision which the bank is appealing.Rowland and his son Jonathan appeared to have had a close relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor, joining him on trips in his capacity as an official trade envoy, to places such as China and former Soviet states.Mountbatten-Windsor had been a guest at the opening of the Banque Havilland and David Rowland had attended the former prince's birthday party and the wedding of his daughter Princess Eugenie.Rowland's son Jonathan told the BBC he and his father \"never had any contact or correspondence or had dinner or met with\" Epstein.Jonathan Rowland did not deny to the BBC that he or his father or Banque Havilland might have paid or lent money to Mountbatten-Windsor or Ferguson, but denied that he had ever provided money in exchange for access to contacts.There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of Jonathan and David Rowland.Andrew-Mountbatten Windsor has been contacted for comment and has strongly denied any wrongdoing in his association with Jeffrey Epstein.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlison Holt,Social affairs editorandJames MelleyGetty ImagesA High Court judge has dismissed a legal challenge to the equality watchdog's guidance on which public or workplace toilets and changing rooms transgender people should use.The judgment urged businesses and services to follow the law, seek specialist advice, but also use \"common sense\" in how they organised facilities such as toilets.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) issued interim guidance last April and withdrew it six months later.It said in situations where single sex facilities are required, they should only be used by people of the same biological sex.It also said that, for instance, a trans woman - a biological male who identifies as a woman - would be expected to use a gender-neutral toilet or male toilets, not those for females.Campaign group, the Good Law Project (GLP),  claimed the guidance was \"legally flawed\" and \"overly simplistic\".Three anonymous individuals also criticised the guidance, which is for employers and public services such as hospitals, shops and restaurants.The judge, Mr Justice Swift, said the submission made to him was that \"in substance\" the guidance suggested service providers can \"require\" a transgender person to use lavatories that correspond to their biological sex.\"I do not consider this is a reasonable reading of the guidance,\" he said.The judge continued that the decision to publish the update \"promptly\" contained \"no error of law\".The commission's now withdrawn guidance was issued shortly after the Supreme Court ruled in April 2025 that under the 2010 Equality Act, the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" referred to a biological woman and biological sex.Swift dismissed an argument from lawyers for the GLP at the hearing last year, that expecting a trans person to use a gender-neutral toilet could amount to \"less favourable treatment\".The judge also refused an application by the campaign group for a judicial review but asked for submissions from all parties on whether an appeal should be allowed.Friday's judgement said \"one clear conclusion\" reached by the Supreme Court was that if an employer or business provided a service used by both men and women \"then it would not be a single sex service\".The judge criticised \"polarised language\" in legal submissions made to the court that suggested a trans person \"must\" use the lavatory that corresponds to their biological sex, or that the guidance assumed that women's rights \"trump\" the rights of trans people.He also said that those who provide facilities should comply with the law but also be \"guided by common sense and benevolence rather than allow themselves to be blinkered by unyielding ideologies\".Jess O'Thomson, the GLP's trans rights lead, said the group was \"deeply concerned about many aspects\" of the court's ruling but that it also showed that the law \"has been dangerously misrepresented\".Gender critical campaign group, Sex Matters, also made legal submissions at the November hearing. On Friday, its chief executive Maya Forstater urged the government to issue the final guidance \"without delay\".She said: \"The law is clear. There was never any excuse for the government, public bodies, regulators, charities or businesses to delay in implementing the Supreme Court judgement.\"The chair of the EHRC, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, welcomed the judgement's finding that its guidance was lawful.\"It's our job to champion everyone's rights under the Equality Act, including those with the protected characteristics of sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. A shared and correct understanding of the law is essential to that endeavour,\" she said.",

I lost a ridiculous amount of time.\"I was never going to be in the fight for a medal, but I probably should have got that fourth spot. But there isn't a massive difference to sixth, without a medal. \"It was good, but I was still beaten by too many Norwegians.\"Musgrave, who relocated to Norway 17 years ago, was seventh in the skiathlon in 2018 - until now Team GB's best result in the sport.And as well as setting a new mark here, he is now only behind fellow Scot Mike Dixon - who competed in cross-country skiing and biathlon between 1984 and 2002 - when it comes to Games appearances for GB. \"Where I come from, we can do a bit of skiing occasionally,\" Musgrave said. \"But it's not the same as being in Scandinavia or the Alps. \"So I don't think we're going to be the world's biggest ski nation. But we've definitely put ourselves on the map as a cross-country nation and shown we can compete.\"Fellow Scot James Clugnet was also in the same race and finished 34th.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivEPA/ShutterstockThe rules-based world order \"no longer exists\", the German Chancellor has warned at a major security summit.Opening the annual Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz told other world leaders that \"our freedom is not guaranteed\" in an era of big power politics, and that Europeans must be ready to make \"sacrifice\".He also admitted that \"a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States\".The conference is taking place on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump threatening Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland by pledging to annex the Arctic territory and his tariffs on imports from European nations.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was listening to Merz and will deliver his own speech on Saturday, earlier spoke of a \"new era in geopolitics\".Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend this year's conference, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed.It comes at a time when US commitments to the Nato military alliance have been called into question. Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland has also been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with their biggest ally.Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday: \"Greenland's gonna want us... We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland.\"The Russia-Ukraine war, tensions between the West and China, as well as a potential Iran-US nuclear deal are also on the agenda at the annual gathering.Referring to multiple warnings that the rules-based order was collapsing, Merz told the conference: \"I fear we must put it even more bluntly: this order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.\"He also said that \"a rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States. Vice-President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago\".Merz continued: \"He was right. The culture war of the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.\"Last year, Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.But Merz did not write off the decades-long partnership, instead appealing directly to the US by saying \"let's repair and revive transatlantic trust\".The German leader also revealed that \"confidential talks\" were ongoing with French President Emmanuel Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent. He gave no further details.France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.Addressing the conference later on Friday, Macron reiterated his call for Europe to \"learn to become a geopolitical power\" in the new global context.He said Europe was already re-arming following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but stressed that \"we have to accelerate\" and work collectively across the continent.Describing the war in Ukraine's as Europe's \"existential challenge\", the French leader urged others not to \"cave in to Russian demands\" - but rather to increase pressure on Moscow to achieve a just peace.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be,\" he said.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier in the day that she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland from its Nato ally.",

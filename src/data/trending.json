Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "11 hours agoAna Faguy and Brandon DrenonSheriff: Savannah Guthrie’s mother’s home treated as a crime sceneThe mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie has been abducted and \"didn't go willingly\" from her home, Arizona law enforcement officials suspect. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of the NBC News host, was last seen in her house outside Tucson, Arizona, on Saturday evening. Her family reported her missing a day later. When authorities arrived, the scene of Nancy Guthrie's property caused \"grave concern\", Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said. He did not provide a possible motive and, while there was no initial indication Nancy Guthrie could have been targeted because of her name, the sheriff said \"we can't dismiss that\".Getty Images\"I believe she was abducted, yes,\" Sheriff Nanos told CBS, the BBC's US partner. \"She didn't walk away from there. She didn't go willingly.\"He told CBS that investigators would try to determine if Guthrie was being stalked or harassed. The FBI is helping the investigation, two sources told CBS.The sheriff offered few details about what he said was still a \"very active\" investigation, and urged the public to call authorities with any information. It is not clear what evidence at her home concerned authorities so much.The Guthrie family previously said in a statement to NBC News: \"We can confirm this is a missing persons case, and the family is working closely with local law enforcement.\"Searchers were sent home on Monday to rest after looking all night for Nancy Guthrie, who is described as \"not in good physical health\", but also has no reported cognitive issues, according to Nanos.They used drones, aircraft, helicopters, heat sensors, and infrared, the sheriff said, adding: \"Everything we have, we've thrown at this.\"In an earlier press conference, Nanos had said homicide detectives were called to the scene, which he said was not standard protocol in a missing person case.  Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her home after 21:00 local time on Saturday (04:00 GMT on Sunday), Nanos said. Savannah Guthrie, who hosts the Today show, was not on air on Monday morning. But her colleagues shared a statement from her, which said: \"On behalf of our family, I want to thank everyone for the thoughts, prayers and messages of support. \"Right now, our focus remains on the safe return of our dear mom.\"The anchor had been due to co-host the Winter Olympics opening ceremony for NBC on Friday, but it is unclear if she will take part in that coverage. Representatives for NBC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesAn estimated one million people missed the deadline to file their tax return and now face penalties, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).The UK's tax authority said 27,456 people filed in the final hour before the cut-off for 2024-25 returns at midnight at the end of Saturday.After HMRC helplines stayed open and webchat services were extended at the weekend, the busiest hour of people filing through online self-assessment was from 17:00 GMT on Saturday.Some 475,722 people filed on the final day out of a total of about 11.5 million submissions. Those who missed the deadline face an automatic £100 penalty.\"Thank you to the millions of people and agents who filed their self assessment tax return and paid any tax owed by 31 January. Anyone who missed the deadline should file their return as soon as possible, as penalties and late payment interest may be charged,\" said Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's chief customer officer.Millions of people have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file each year through self-assessment.They included those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.Some who were not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who had switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.A similar number of people missed the filing deadline a year earlier. Anyone doing so faces the following penalties: An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on timeAfter three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greaterThere are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 monthsIf tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owedHMRC, which raises tens of millions of pounds each year from penalties, will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a reasonable excuse may avoid being fined.Tax analysts advise anyone appealing to still pay the initial penalty.\"Although it involves shelling out cash, it avoids you paying interest on the penalty itself from the date it became due if you lose your appeal,\" said Charlene Young, senior pensions and savings expert at investment platform AJ Bell.\"If you don't have an excuse to appeal a fine but still owe money, you might still be able to set up a payment plan to get back on track. It's essential you don't put your head in the sand.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoPeter HoskinsAFP via Getty ImagesChina has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.",

The BBC has approached the company for a response.X previously described the widening of the probe, in July 2025, in a post at the time, as \"politically-motivated\" and denied allegations it had manipulated its algorithm.Prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.The prosecutor's office also said it was leaving X and would communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram from now on.Musk's social media platform has recently been subject to intense scrutiny over sexualised images generated and edited on the site using its AI tool Grok.The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\".It added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because of limitations in the law in terms of its powers relating to chatbots.However, another regulator - the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) - said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcom, Executive Director Regulatory Risk & Innovation at the ICO.Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\". \"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added in a post on X.Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.",

    "body": "11 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, has announced it will close \"for the foreseeable future\" just days after new details emerged about the former Duchess of York's friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.A spokesman for the foundation said the decision comes after \"some months\" of discussion. Among the more than three million documents released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) last week were emails appearing to show Ferguson was in contact with Epstein while he was in prison for soliciting sex from a minor.The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment on the latest release. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The charity Sarah's Trust was established in 2020 and is \"dedicated to supporting frontline, grassroots work to address the humanitarian and environmental crisis, the hunger crisis and issues perpetuating cycles of extreme poverty\", according to its website.\"Our chair Sarah Ferguson and the board of trustees have agreed that with regret the charity will shortly close for the foreseeable future,\" a spokesman said on Monday evening.\"This has been under discussion and in train for some months,\" he added.The foundation did not provide further details behind its decision to close.Previous revelations surrounding the former duchess' ties to Epstein led to her being dropped as a patron or ambassador from a series of charities last year.Julia's House, a children's hospice, was the first to remove her, saying it was \"inappropriate\" for her to continue in the role.The Teenage Cancer Trust, Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, Children's Literacy Charity, National Foundation for Retired Service Animals and Prevent Breast Cancer also announced they had dropped Ferguson as patron.The British Heart Foundation said she would no longer be its ambassador.Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment.In another email, Ferguson appears to congratulate Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\".Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"Then on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".",

    "body": "UK launches plan to tackle 'forever chemicals' amid growing concerns13 hours agoEsme StallardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesThe UK is to increase testing for so-called \"forever chemicals\" in the environment as part of a national plan to tackle the substances, which have prompted environmental and health concerns.The group of chemicals, also known as PFAS, are used in many everyday products because of their oil resistant and waterproof properties.But scientists are concerned because their chemical structures mean they accumulate and remain in the environment, with a small number of PFAS known to be toxic.The government says that by 2029 it wants to align more closely with regulations issued by the EU, which is looking to prohibit all non-essential uses.Some environmental groups and the water industry have urged the government to act more quickly in banning the chemicals.But new regulations currently take around five years to put in place, and the Chemicals Industries Association has said there are some critical industries such as hydrogen production where there are few alternatives. Forever chemicals are \"one of the most pressing chemical challenges of our time,\" Environment Minister Emma Hardy said as she launched the plan. \"It's crucial that we protect both public health and the environment for future generations. Through our PFAS Plan, we will act decisively to reduce their harmful effects while transitioning to safer alternatives,\" she said.The plan centres around three key aims:increasing knowledge of where the most harmful PFAS are turning upunderstand how their use in everyday products can be reducedwork with industry to look for alternatives The number of water samples tested for PFAS will be increased by 50% across Scotland and Wales, whilst animals in coastal areas of England and soils in five priority areas will be tested to identify hotspots. PFAS are now ubiquitous in our everyday lives, used for example in school uniforms, medication casings and hydrogen production. Their incredibly strong chemical bonds give them properties which industries find very useful, such as being water-and oil-resistant, and they are also cheap to manufacture. But Dr Liz Chadwick, senior lecturer in biosciences at Cardiff University, said the chemicals leak out into the environment from manufacturing, washing our clothes or products with PFAS, as well as from the spread of waste sludge from water treatment works onto agricultural fields. \"PFAS are very persistent in the environment, they are also bioaccumulative and they are also known to be toxic, those three things together gives our rise for concern about chemicals in the environment,\" said Other household products they can be found in include cosmetics, baking equipment and frying pans, dishwasher rinse aid and polish.Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsSome clothing brands are trialling alternative chemicals to PFAS that produce the same waterproof properties As well as more testing, the government also wants to raise public awareness by launching a website dedicated to information on the chemicals. The plan has been broadly welcomed by environmental charities and scientists but there is disagreement about whether further research is needed before restrictions are put in place.\"More research, more monitoring is important, but that should not come before regulating them at the source. We should not be waiting for people to start showing adverse impacts before we take action,\" said Dr Shubhi Sharma, scientific researcher at environmental charity Chem Trust. She said the government should take a \"precautionary principle\" approach, where the use of a chemical is stopped if the potential harm could outweigh the benefits - considering the emerging risks of some PFAS.Earlier this year the World Health Organization raised significant concerns, about two specific PFAS. It classified PFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic - increasing the risk of thyroid, testicular and kidney cancers. Both substances are already banned in the UK. Although the new plan does not include a commitment to banning PFAS, the government has said the UK will \"more closely align\" by December 2028 with EU regulations. The EU is proposing a universal ban on the chemicals unless they are proven essential for society. Closer alignment could speed up future regulation of PFAS, said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry.\"Our regulators after Brexit have been overwhelmed and busy with adapting to the changes that Brexit has caused, and so it means that doing this sort of in-depth work has often been pushed back. And so I think this is a really positive step,\" she said.  Hans Lucas_AFP/Getty ImagesFrance has banned the use of PFAS in all products where an alternative exists after significant public protestSome manufacturers have already gone PFAS-free. But doing so is expensive, said Debbie Reed at Equip Outdoor Technologies, which owns outdoor brands Rab and Lowe Alpine.\"It's challenging as our supply chains are complex, in an insulating jacket there are 120 components. To make sure the products are PFAS-free we have to make sure the entire production line is cleaned,\" she said. But the water industry thinks the government should go much further and ban the chemicals completely.Currently water companies have to regularly test for the 48 most concerning PFAS and where levels are elevated, treat the water supply. This is a costly endeavour and something the industry says it should not be responsible for. \"While this is a useful first step, the government needs to go much further. The problem with PFAS will only get worse until chemical companies are forced to stop their manufacture and sale and clean up the mess they've already created,\" said a spokesperson for industry body Water UK. But the Chemical Industries Association pushed back and said that while it was working to find alternatives to PFAS, this is not a quick process.\"Finding suitable and viable alternatives that are environmentally better and provide the needed performance is a challenging task, often needing innovators to return to the drawing board in search of a potential replacement,\" said the trade body's spokesperson.

    "body": "3 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentLondon News PicturesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor seen in Windsor at the weekendAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor faces growing pressure to give evidence of what he knows about Jeffrey Epstein, with royal sources saying: \"Anyone who has information should consider helping any investigation.\"\"But that is ultimately a matter for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his conscience,\" says the royal source.The latest emails released by the US Department of Justice reveal there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.Gloria Allred, a prominent lawyer representing some of the US sex offender's victims, added to the calls, saying: \"It's not too late and he does have information he could share.\"\"Why was he willing to speak to the BBC in a one-hour catastrophic television interview, but is not willing to speak to law enforcement?,\" Allred said, referring to Andrew's now-infamous Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis in 2019.\"He's not the one who should decide whether he knows anything that could help in the investigation,\" Allred told the BBC.This followed comments from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who said: \"In terms of testifying, I have always said anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information.\"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that.\"According to royal sources, the lack of official comment so far from Buckingham Palace regarding the latest Epstein document releases should not be seen as complacency, but royal aides are said to fully understand the sense of public upset.It is understood that the Palace does not receive advance notice of the released files and that royal aides have been monitoring what has emerged.The official position from Buckingham Palace remains that the King and Queen's \"thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse\".So far Andrew has shown no signs of giving evidence. He has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.Last autumn, Democrats in the US Congress set a November deadline for the former prince to testify about what he knew about Epstein, but he gave no response.The latest batch of emails have revealed the previous extent of US attempts to get Andrew to give evidence.In the early months of 2020 there were multiple email exchanges between the US Department of Justice and Andrew's legal team, in which the US authorities tried to pin down a time and place for him to give evidence.This testimony could have been given in the UK or in the US, but the frosty exchanges between the lawyers made little progress, despite both sides pointing to Andrew's public commitment to helping with investigating authorities.ReutersAndrew was seen riding a horse through Windsor Great Park on MondayIn apparent frustration, the US Department of Justice said there was no point \"rehashing our previous conversations\" and reiterated the question \"as to whether Prince Andrew will agree to be interviewed and if so when such interview will take place\".Another email reveals that US authorities had concluded that \"efforts to obtain a truly voluntary interview have been exhausted\".Obtaining a testimony from Andrew then meant the US legal authorities needed to formally ask their UK counterparts for help - in what's known as mutual legal assistance - whereby one country can ask for another's co-operation to compel overseas witnesses to testify.The emails show this process did begin, with a request delivered to the Home Office in April 2020. An email from a US legal representative noted their surprise at the timing and that it had arrived when the \"pandemic in London is expected to peak in the next week or two\".Later, the US ambassador in the UK seemed to be showing concern about what was happening - and there were further questions in August 2021 about the implications of a case being brought in the US against Andrew by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him and Epstein of sexual assault.That would make Andrew the defendant rather than a witness, complicating the status of a request for a statement from him, while the case was in progress.There were also comments from the US side about their UK counterparts \"wringing their hands\" about information over Andrew.The civil case brought by Virginia Giuffre was ultimately settled out of court in 2022, with Andrew rejecting any claims of wrongdoing and not having to deliver any testimony.

Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Epstein was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. An email dated 14 June 2009 from a \"Sarah\" says: \"I need to ask you how I start The Mothers Army company so it can be commercial, how do I do that? Can you help me?\"Then on the 26 June 2009, \"Sarah\" writes to Epstein saying: \"I am alive... yes I did go to the first lady and she loved the Mothers Army. I am going to call you later Love you\".Mothers Army, a company which was set up \"to help amplify the voices of Mothers all over the world\", is listed under Sarah Margaret Ferguson with a registered address to Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, in Companies House.But in an email to a \"Ferg\" in 2011, Epstein writes: \"of course you can have mothers army, it was always for you„ Im not sure how to transfer it, but rest assured , it is your in its entirety, I will ask how the transfer is accomplished, we just want to be careful that there is no downside at the moment to have a transaction between you and I.\"The documents indicate that Ferguson had a close relationship with Epstein, even planning to meet him at his home five days after he was released from prison.BBC News has followed an email thread between a “Sarah\", Epstein and his assistants.An exchange between Epstein and one of his assistants, whose name and email have been redacted, talk about arranging flights for \"Sarah Ferguson\" and two assistants, adding \"she wants to fly from London to Miami on Sunday, come to see you Monday, then fly to NYC, and back to London from there\".The next day 24 July 2009, another email exchange between Epstein and his personal assistant, Lesley Groff, states she had been in contact with \"The Duchess' assistant\" and Groff goes on to confirm she bought British Airways flights, totalling \"for all tickets: $14,080.10\". Epstein wrote he approved the purchase.Another email exchange between Jeffrey Epstein and a \"Sarah\" suggests a lunch meeting happened at his Palm Beach home on 27 July 2009.The emails detail the arrangements being made, including \"Sarah\" asking: \"What address shall we come to. It will be myself, Beatrice and Eugenie\". Epstein gave her the address as 358 El Brillo.At the time of the visit, Princess Eugenie was 19 and Princess Beatrice was 21.During the exchange Epstein asks whether \"Sarah\" needs a lift, but the response is \"No thank you. I made Philip give us his car and a back up one for the policeman\".Epstein also offers them food, suggesting a menu of \"vegetable lasagna„ or anything else you would like, chef here from Paris\".“Cannot wait to see you\", is the response.After his prison sentence, the disgraced financier was under house arrest for his child sex abuse convictions. The house arrest sentence ended in the summer of 2010.Emails suggest there were three other meetings between the pair in 2009.The latest release of files related to the late Epstein included pictures of Ferguson's ex-husband Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling over a female lying on the floor, while there have been other embarrassing revelations for the family. In one email Ferguson congratulates Epstein on the arrival of a \"baby boy\", before following up by accusing him of only befriending her \"to get to Andrew\".Another email to Epstein, sent from a redacted address, appears to refer to Eugenie's love life - saying she is returning from a \"shagging weekend\",  Mountbatten-Windsor has always consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment. Ferguson's representatives have also been approached.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Why is no one being prosecuted over the Epstein files?Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State, have agreed to testify in the congressional investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It comes days before a vote on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt for refusing to appear before the House Oversight Committee after a months-long standoff.  Bill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has denied knowledge of his sex offending and says he cut off contact two decades ago. It's unclear when the depositions will take place, but it will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.The Clintons had long resisted a demand to appear before the committee, saying they had already given sworn statements representing the \"limited information\" they had on Epstein.They had dismissed the legal summonses issued by the committee as \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed\".The House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans, then approved the measure to hold the Clintons in contempt late last month, with the support of several Democrats.On Saturday, lawyers for the couple made an offer for them to provide limited testimony that would have centred on a four-hour interview by Bill Clinton. But House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer expressed concerns that the former president would stonewall questions and run down the clock.On Monday evening, Bill Clinton's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña posted on X confirming the couple would appear before the panel.\"They negotiated in good faith,\" Ureña wrote in a tweet directed at the House Oversight Committee. \"You did not. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"Afterwards, it was announced that lawmakers' consideration of the contempt resolutions against the Clintons would be postponed. House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx said the Oversight Committee needed more time \"to clarify with the Clintons what they are actually agreeing to\".For his part, Comer said: \"I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.\"Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and they have denied knowledge of his sex offending.Hillary Clinton, former US senator and secretary of state, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, has said she never met or spoke to Epstein.US Department of JusticeBill Clinton in a hot tub, in the Epstein filesEpstein's private jet logs show that Clinton took four international flights in 2002 and 2003.Shortly after Epstein was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July 2019, Clinton's spokesperson said the former president took trips on the plane including \"stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation\".The former president also appears at the late financier's estate in photos that were among a batch of records released by the justice department to comply with a law passed by Congress mandating the disclosure of all investigative material relating to the late convicted paedophile.One picture shows the former president swimming in a pool, and another shows him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Ureña, Clinton's spokesman, said at the time the photos were released in December that they were decades old and Clinton had stopped associating with Epstein before his crimes came to light.Watch: What's in the latest batch of released Epstein files?Last month, the Clintons wrote a letter to James Comer, the House Oversight Committee chairman, criticising his handling of the Epstein investigation. \"The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government's role,\" the letter said. They added: \"There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.\"Comer previously noted the subpoenas to the Clintons were approved in a bipartisan vote and said \"no-one is above the law\".\"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay,\" said the Kentucky Republican.",

    "body": "47 minutes agoSarah RainsfordEastern and Southern Europe correspondent in KyivAFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents shelter at a train station during Russian air raidsRussia has launched its \"most powerful blow\" against Ukraine's energy sector so far this year, according to the private energy company, DTEK.The combined missile and drone strikes which targeted power plants and infrastructure in Kyiv and multiple locations left the system operating with \"serious restrictions\", it said.The strikes were launched as temperatures dropped to -20C  (-4F) and left more than 1,000 tower blocks in the capital without heating once again and damaged a power plant in the eastern city of Kharkiv beyond repair.President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia was \"choosing terror and escalation\" rather than diplomacy to end this war and called for \"maximum pressure\" on Moscow from Ukraine's allies.The attack comes after a so-called \"energy truce\" agreed by Donald Trump with Vladimir Putin expired at the weekend.It also came on the day Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte was in Kyiv to meet President Zelensky and to address the national parliament.Donald Trump's initiative was meant to give diplomacy a chance. Negotiators from Russia and Ukraine are due to meet in Abu Dhabi for another round of talks co-ordinated by the US later this week.It is clear that Russia has other ideas.And in fact, there is always a gap between Russia's massive strikes which makes Ukrainians doubt there was ever any real pause at all.We heard the first explosions in Kyiv soon after midnight and the air raid lasted more than seven hours. There were several subsequent blasts.Residents spent the night sheltering in metro stations, with some pitching tents on the platforms to protect them from the freezing cold.President Zelensky has said more than 70 ballistic and cruise missiles were fired - significantly more than usual - together with 450 drones which are used to overwhelm Ukraine's air defences.Ukraine's Air Force said it had intercepted only 38 of the missiles, which means many reached their target.Officials here have complained repeatedly of a shortage of missiles to protect the skies. Ukraine relies on US-made Patriot missiles, in particular.\"Timely delivery of missiles for air defense systems and the protection of normal life are our priority,\" Zelenksy wrote on X this morning. \"Without pressure on Russia, there will be no end to this war.\"ReutersPolice officer carries a part of a Russian drone at the site of a residential building in Kyiv on 3 February, 2026Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of using the coldest days of winter to \"terrorise people\".DTEK has confirmed that two of its own power plants were hit again overnight, including in Odesa, in what it says was the ninth massive attack on the sector since October.State-run facilities were hit in Kyiv, Dnipro and elsewhere, adding to serious damage caused by a series of previous targeted attacks.DTEK says some of the plants targeted were providing heating only, not electricity, which means they were exclusively for civilian use. The Geneva Convention makes clear that targeting civilian infrastructure is a potential war crime.Each time makes it harder to carry out repairs and leaves the system more fragile, and prone to blackouts. Teams of engineers have been working through the night for weeks to fix things - drafted in from all over the country and hailed as heroes.But there are not enough workers to keep up with demand.We have met residents who have had no heating in their homes for days, in some cases weeks. They sleep in hats and coats, and under piles of blankets, but it is still bitterly cold.Many use soup kitchens to get free hot meals because there are also power cuts here for hours on end.People believe these attacks are intended to turn them against the authorities in Kyiv, to make their lives so miserable they submit to Russia's demands - including to hand over land in the eastern Donbas region that Moscow currently does not control.Instead, there is a lot of anger here at Russia for attempting to freeze civilians in their homes as well as resistance to any form of compromise with Moscow.\"Russia won't get what it wants,\" Vera told the BBC this weekend, as she queued for a bowl of stew served by volunteers. \"We are stronger than them in any case.\"Volodymyr said he planned to sleep in a local school for a few days, which has a generator to keep it warm. \"In the daytime you move around a bit,\" he said. \"But at night it's really cold.\"He was furious with Russia. \"They are bombing civilians. They want us to freeze and die,\" he said.Several residential buildings were damaged in the latest attack and set on fire by falling debris as Ukraine shot down missiles and drones. Several people were injured.More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandLily Jamali,North America Technology correspondentReutersElon Musk's SpaceX is taking over his artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, as the billionaire continues to unify some of his many business interests. SpaceX confirmed the deal to acquire xAI, a smaller firm known for its Grok chatbot, posting a memo from Musk about the merger on its website.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, a source familiar said it valued xAI at $125bn (£91bn) and SpaceX at $1tn, making it the most valuable private company ever.In his memo, Musk said the combination would form an \"innovation engine\" putting AI, rockets, space-based internet, and media under one roof. xAI began as a segment of X, formerly known as Twitter, after Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, using its access to real-time text and information as AI training data.By spring of 2025, it was independently incorporated and valued more highly by investors than X.In recent weeks, the European Commission and UK watchdog Ofcom both launched investigations into X over concerns Grok was used to create sexualised images. xAI said in January it had imposed restrictions on Grok users that limit image editing.Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Musk was the market leader in the \"two incredibly frontier technologies\" of AI and space exploration.She said because the new merger is entirely private, it hasn't been tested by the market in the same way as Tesla, which is publicly listed.\"But what you're seeing priced in at these valuations is a kind of multi-decade vision for the company to put... energy and energy generation into space, data centres into space,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.However, Wall said any potential benefits would not be seen on earth for \"10, 20, 30 years\".'Super company'The huge merger comes after Musk's electric car company, Tesla, announced a $2bn investment in xAI last month.Musk told Tesla investors that he envisioned xAI functioning as an \"orchestra conductor\" for Tesla factories employing autonomous robots.He also said it would stop manufacturing two car models in favour of producing robots - one of the most significant pivots the company has made.\"It's those type of technologies that he'll be looking to leverage with this new kind of super company,\" Wall told the Today programme.ReutersMusk has said humanoid robots are central to Tesla's future as an AI market leaderTesla moved forward with the xAI investment despite objections from some shareholders, who had questioned the decision to divert resources to another Musk firm. In a vote last year, abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.SpaceX is also reported to be working on plans to list its shares for public trading.Emily Zheng, a senior analyst at Pitchbook, said the deal for xAI has all the markings of a company preparing for a public listing. \"The sheer cost of compute, infrastructure, and energy is why we are seeing many of venture's most valuable startups like SpaceX prepare to go public this year,\" Zheng said. \"Consolidating these companies ahead of an IPO allows SpaceX to present a differentiated, capital-efficient growth narrative to public investors.\"IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, and this is when a private company first sells its stock to the public on a stock exchange.Scaling ambitionsIn the SpaceX memo announcing the xAI merger, Musk said he thought space would provide the solution to the energy needs faced by AI firms.\"In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,\" he wrote.He said launching AI satellites from Earth would be the \"immediate focus\", but added that the deal would also help advance his bigger ambitions. \"The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,\" he wrote.Neuralink and The Boring Company now appear to be the only two smaller Musk companies that have not been brought under one of his larger operations.xAI acquired social media platform X in an all-stock deal last March, with Musk saying the merger would \"combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent\".",

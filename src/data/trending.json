    "body": "4 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson has said that he refused to give police his mobile phone Pin when he was stopped at the entry to the Channel Tunnel because it had \"journalist material\" on it, a court has heard.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was charged under the Terrorism Act after allegedly failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers in Folkestone in July 2024.He is on trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court and has pleaded not guilty.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.Robinson's trial began on Monday and is expected to last two days. He is charged under his real name and is being referred to as Mr Lennon in court.Before the hearing, the former English Defence League (EDL) leader addressed his X followers in a video taken while en route to court.He said the social media platform's billionaire owner Elon Musk - who has previously championed Mr Lennon - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Musk has not publicly confirmed this.In court, the 42-year-old sat in the dock wearing a navy waistcoat and tie.PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer with Kent Police, told the court that he was on duty policing vehicles travelling to France at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone on 28 July 2024.He described seeing a silver Bentley, an \"unusual car to come through\", with a lone occupant - Mr Lennon.PS Farmer, who was supervising the officers at the Channel Tunnel entrance that day, told the court that Mr Lennon had said he was delivering a friend's \"extremely high value\" Bentley Bentayga to Benidorm.Both he and PC Thorogood told the court they were suspicious of the account Mr Lennon gave them.\"He was travelling a far distance with a vehicle that wasn't his,\" PC Thorogood said.He added that Mr Lennon did not make eye contact with him during the exchange and had told him that he had not bought a ticket in advance, which the officer described as \"unusual\".PC Thorogood also described detaining Mr Lennon under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. He said Mr Lennon started filming him, and the officers took away his mobile phone.\"He refused to provide the Pin number, saying there was journalist material in his phone,\" PC Thorogood said.Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, suggested the stop may have been \"discriminatory\" against his political beliefs.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that Mr Lennon had used an expletive at officers and had told them that his phone contained information about \"vulnerable girls\".\"The process by which journalistic material would be protected was explained to him,\" Ms Morris said.She told the court the officers had also found a small bag in the Bentley containing £13,370 and €1,910 (£1,660).District Judge Sam Goozee said the defendant's address should not be published, after his barrister said there were \"credible threats against Mr Lennon's life\".Mr Williamson told the judge that he did not expect his client to give evidence in his defence.The public gallery at the back of court was packed with more than 30 of his supporters, who had queued from early morning. One was wearing a red Mega (Make England Great Again) baseball cap.The trial continues.",

    "body": "Prisoner questioned over schoolgirl's 1994 murder7 hours agoJulia BrysonYorkshirePA MediaLindsay Rimer was found dead five months after she went missing from home A prisoner has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a 13-year-old girl who was found dead months after she went missing from her home in 1994. Lindsay Rimer left her home in Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, on 7 November to buy cornflakes from a nearby shop but never returned. In April 1995, her body was found in the Rochdale Canal, about a mile from the town, weighted down with a stone.West Yorkshire Police said a man was arrested on Monday at an unnamed UK prison where he was serving a sentence for other offences.A force spokesperson said officers were \"keeping Lindsay's family updated\", adding that the arrest was \"as a result of our continued focus on progressing the investigation\".The arrested man would be interviewed by police on Monday and Tuesday and was expected to be bailed and returned to prison while inquiries continued, the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, officers were approaching \"a number of specific potential witnesses, mainly in the Hebden Bridge and wider Halifax area\", who had been identified by the investigation.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Monday's arrest was the first in the investigation into Lindsay's murder since 2017.West Yorkshire PoliceCCTV images show Lindsay buying cornflakes shortly before she disappearedOn the night Lindsay went missing in November 1994, she had left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT before calling in to see her mother at the Trades Club, a members club and music venue in Hebden Bridge.She was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes from the Spar shop on Crown Street.Lindsay Rimer: The girl who went to buy cornflakes and never came homeThe last confirmed sighting of Lindsay was not long after this, as she was seen leaning against a wall near the Memorial Garden.Her body was found by two canal workers the following spring.The search for the schoolgirl was one of the largest carried out by West Yorkshire Police. Lindsay's family has described not knowing what happened to her as \"like living a life sentence\".Alex Moss/BBCDet Ch Insp James Entwistle said police remained committed to the investigation into Lindsay's murderConfirming the new arrest, Det Ch Insp James Entwistle, senior investigating officer, said: \"We remain very firmly committed to doing everything we can to get justice for Lindsay, and to give her family the answers they still so desperately need after all these years.\"While we appreciate the understandable public interest that today's arrest will bring, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.\"Det Ch Insp Entwistle added: \"Although it is now more than 30 years since Lindsay was murdered, we remain convinced there is someone out there who has vital information that could finally help to ease her family's pain.\"We urge them do the right thing and tell us what they know.\"Anyone with information that could help the investigation was asked to contact West Yorkshire Police.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "6 hours agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spiesThe government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead.In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame.The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact.What was the case about?Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Why did it collapse?Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.What was the political fallout?Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place.He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a \"threat to national security\".Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument.Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions.Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case.Why is this a problem for the government?Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because \"the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing\" - something it has denied.Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy.Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year.The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests.However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoJohn Swinney says the SNP government will open a nationwide network of walk-in GP servicesScotland's first minister has announced a network of walk-in GP services to deliver one million more appointments across the country.John Swinney said they would operate seven days a week, from noon to 20:00, to tackle \"the 08:00 rush for appointments\" putting pressure on surgeries.The announcement came during his keynote speech at the SNP conference in Aberdeen.Swinney also reiterated his commitment to Scottish independence, revealed a sponsorship scheme for social care workers, and criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over Labour's record at WestminsterSwinney speech as it happened: \"Now is the time\" for Scottish independenceThe first minister said there was \"no more important issue\" than the NHS.He told delegates that his walk-in GP scheme would begin at 15 sites then expand across Scotland.He said: \"They will break from the status quo. They will add to the care we already value. Staffed by GPs and nurses.\"And you won't need to call up for an appointment. That means more people can go after work - when it fits with their lives.\"Swinney promised that the first site would be up and running \"within the year\".PA MediaThe SNP leader was speaking at the end of his party's conference in AberdeenThe first minister also said Scotland was being damaged by a morally wrong \"race to the right\" by parties at Westminster.He said this had led to an \"80 per cent fall\" in the number of overseas nurses the NHS was able to recruit and the shutdown of a visa route for care home staff.Swinney said: \"Thousands of care workers here in the UK entirely legally have been left high and dry. \"Unable to work, while care homes are crying out for staff. In what world does that make any sense?\"He said the Scottish government would sponsor overseas staff so they can \"work, pay tax and help keep Scotland's care homes running\". Swinney said Scotland's older people \"must not pay the price for Westminster's prejudice\".PA MediaParty members, including Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes, voted in favour of Swinney's plans on SaturdayThe first minister went on to criticise Sir Keir Starmer, who he said had promised to be a left-wing Labour leader but had become a \"right-wing prime minister\".\"Now he's dressing up as Nigel Farage,\" he said.He said Starmer had not produced the progressive policies that had earned Labour its votes.Swinney said he was committed to offering Scotland a \"fresh start\"  through independence.He said it would be \"a modern, outward-looking, inclusive compassionate country. \"Not a devolved nation but the world's newest independent nation.\"On Saturday, SNP members backed Swinney's plan to declare a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election.Swinney told delegates his proposals were the most realistic way of pursuing the goal, based on a precedent which brought about the 2014 referendum.Scotland voted against leaving the UK by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7% in September 2014.Sir Keir Starmer, who would have to agree to any vote, previously said he could not imagine indyref 2 taking place during his time in office.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterEating several kiwi fruit a day can help relieve constipation and is a better starting point than worrying about a high-fibre diet, according to new guidance for doctors on the condition.The advice says drinking water high in minerals is better for constipation than tap water, and magnesium oxide supplements are good for improving symptoms.Researchers from King's College London, who produced the guidance by examining all available evidence, said there are many more options for getting things moving than the standard advice to \"just have more fibre in your diet\".Constipation that doesn't go away affects one in 10 people and can have a major impact on someone's quality of life.You are constipated if you haven't had a bowel motion (poo) at least three times during the last week, or you're going less often than usual, says the NHS.Straining on the loo or feeling like you haven't fully emptied your bowels may also be signs of constipation - but these aren't the only ones.\"People can report up to 30 different symptoms of constipation,\" says Dr Eirini Dimidi, lead study author and reader in nutritional sciences at King's College London (KCL).The new guidance suggests the best remedy is to focus on fruit and drinks first, rather than worrying about the latest probiotic in the supermarket or packing your diet full of different kinds of fibre, she says.Dr Dimidi recommends eating two or three kiwis throughout the day or 8-10 prunes to improve constipation. Skin on or skin off the kiwi? \"Even without the skin, it's good and contains fibre,\" she explains, but adds there's no harm keeping the skin on either.The fibre in kiwi fruit affects the gut in a way which increases the volume of stool, which can also induce contractions in the bowel.\"Kiwi also increases water content into the gut which may soften stools,\" Dr Dimidi says.Snacking on 8-10 prunes a day and some rye bread can also have a similar effect.Mineral water \"is better than tap water\" to drink, she says, although bottled water in the UK is lower in minerals than water available elsewhere, such as eastern Europe.The crucial mineral is magnesium, which has a laxative effect. And that's why taking magnesium oxide supplements was found to have lots of benefits, according to the research.These included reducing lower tummy pain, bloating, straining - and making it easier to poo. Regarding probiotics, the guidelines suggest some types can improve some symptoms but there is also a lack of research on the impact of many different probiotic strains.Up until now, guidance for doctors treating patients with constipation has been limited and outdated, and focused on advice to increase dietary fibre and water intake, say the researchers.The new recommendations are based on evidence from 75 clinical trials - all those available - which have been analysed by a panel of experts.Prof Kevin Whelan, senior research author and professor of dietetics at KCL, said the new guidance \"marks a promising step towards empowering health professionals and their patients to manage constipation through diet\". He said this meant people suffering from constipation could now access up-to-date advice to help improve their symptoms, wellbeing and quality of life.The British Dietetic Association, which funded the project to produce the new guidelines, said they were an excellent resource for dietitians, doctors and nurses, and supported \"a more diet-focused and evidence-based approach to the management of chronic constipation\".The research and the new guidelines are published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics.",

    "body": "1 hour agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentPA MediaAn undercover officer was part of clashes when the five men originally accused of Lawrence murder appeared at an inquiry in 1998An undercover police officer took part in clashes during the Stephen Lawrence inquiry as part of his cover so he could better spy on anti-racism groups, one of the UK's longest-running public inquiries has been told.The decade-old Undercover Policing Inquiry, which began its latest phase of hearings on Monday, heard that there may be evidence of overt racism in how a now-disbanded team targeted black justice campaigners in the 1990s.Officers gathered information relating to Baroness Lawrence and Dr Neville Lawrence as they fought for justice over their son's 1993 racist murder, even though they had nothing to do with groups which the police force believed could be a danger to public order.The inquiry - which has cost £114m so far - began in 2015 after allegations emerged of abuses by undercover officers, including deceiving women into sexual relationships.In an opening statement on Monday, the inquiry's lead lawyer David Barr KC said it would hear \"deeply moving\" evidence from justice campaigners including the Lawrence family and Sukdev Reel, whose son Ricky died in 1997 in what many suspect was a racist murder.Mr Barr said that the inquiry would look at why Scotland Yard had deployed undercover officers to gather information relating to campaigns such as these and to what extent those operations may have been motivated by racism.One of those officers was a man known only as HN81 or \"David Hagan\" due to an anonymity order.By 1997 he had been deployed to gather intelligence on the anti-racism movement in London at a time when the force was preparing to face a public inquiry over how it had botched the investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder.Stephen, 18, was stabbed by a gang as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.While the thrust of the evidence so far is that HN81 did not get close enough to the family to have become a key figure in their campaign, he has admitted being part of infamous clashes on the day that the five murder suspects gave evidence to the Lawrence inquiry in 1998.\"He [HN81] accepts being involved in the public disorder,\" Mr Barr said.\"HN81 describes that day as the most serious incident of public disorder he witnessed and participated in. He describes shouting, aggressive posturing and joining in with the pushing and shoving once that had begun.\"The police ultimately used CS gas to try to control the crowd - leading to Baroness Lawrence appealing for calm.\"It is undeniable that the Stephen Lawrence Campaign was conducted throughout in a manner that defied public disorder, advocating for order and calm, even where some would have had it otherwise,\" said Mr Barr.\"Dr Neville Lawrence is appalled that a police officer was involved in such action. He has stated to the inquiry that it is (I quote) 'particularly troubling that an officer who sought to justify surveillance on the grounds of public disorder actively contributed to it'.\"Another key witness for the latest tranche of evidence is Peter Francis, a former officer of the now disbanded Special Demonstration Squad at the heart of the allegations of wrongdoing.His revelations were one of the factors that triggered the public inquiry.When he gives evidence in December, Mr Francis is expected to say that in 1993 - six months after Stephen's murder - he was receiving racially-motivated orders from a manager known only as \"HN86\" to gather information relating to that justice campaign and other causes.\"Mr Francis portrays HN86 as a thoroughly and overtly racist man who, amongst other things, instructed him to seek out intelligence for the purpose of undermining black justice campaigns,\" said Mr Barr.\"In particular, information about the Lawrence family which could be used to discredit them and to destroy the Stephen Lawrence Campaign.\"Mr Francis asserts that he was also expected to report information that might discredit Duwayne Brooks [Stephen Lawrence's friend who had been with him on the night of the fatal attack].\"HN86 denies these allegations. We will be looking at them very closely indeed.\"In a brief opening address, Peter Skelton KC, representing the Metropolitan Police, said the force apologised to the family of Stephen Lawrence, his friend Duwayne Brooks, Sukhdev Reel, and other justice campaigners.\"There was a collective failure to exercise ethical judgment about the purpose of undercover policing and the propriety of reporting on family justice campaigns,\" he said.\"This is reflective of an 'us against them' culture that prevailed within the MPS at that time, which didn't properly distinguish between legitimate intelligence targets, such as groups committed to inciting serious public disorder, and illegitimate targets such as grieving black and Asian families who were complaining about injustice and the actions of the police.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames FitzGeraldWatch: 'It will be a golden age for the Middle East' - TrumpUS President Donald Trump has told cheering Israeli lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\", after helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.During the first such address by a US president since 2008, Trump said the day would mark \"the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better\" in the Middle East.Trump's address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, comes on the day that the last 20 living hostages held in the Palestinian enclave were released by Hamas. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza.During a whirlwind trip to the region, Trump is also attending a peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and other world leaders.After arriving in Egypt, he said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset earlier in the day, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump said.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.His speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.Follow live updatesWho are the released Israeli hostages?Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by IsraelWhat we know about Gaza ceasefire agreementTrump was introduced to parliament by Netanyahu, who saluted his counterpart's various acts of solidarity with Israel. Trump was the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, Netanyahu added.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"ReutersTrump was the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu saidThe ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.In his remarks to parliament, Netanyahu said he was \"committed to this peace\".Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.But some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Freed hostage Eitan Mor's emotional reunion with family",

    "body": "6 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBettmann / GettyWoody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie HallUS actor and filmmaker Woody Allen has paid a lengthy, glowing tribute to Diane Keaton who died on Saturday aged 79.Writing in The Free Press, Allen described Keaton as \"unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again,\" adding that \"her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered\".In a long personal essay, Allen recalled first meeting Keaton in 1969 during rehearsals for his play Play It Again, Sam before going on to make eight films with her including Annie Hall, which she won best actress for at the 1977 Oscars.\"As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,\" wrote Allen.\"I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it.\"In Annie Hall, Keaton played the role of the film's quirky, insecure and free-spirited titular star, who Allen's character, Alvy Singer, falls in love with.The pair were at one point romantically involved in real life.Reminiscing on the first time they met, Allen remembered thinking: \"If Huckleberry Finn [writer Mark Twain's fictional vagabond] was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton.\"He added that the world was now a \"drearier\" place without her in it.\"Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head.\"She starred in other Allen titles such as Manhattan, Sleeper and Radio Days.Silver Screen Collection / ContributorThe pair pictured together on the set of comedy film Sleeper in 1973Keaton remained a supporter of Allen, a controversial figure, who was accused of molesting his daughter Dylan, which he has always denied.No charges have ever been brought against the star.She told the Guardian in 2023: \"He gave me everything. He really did. Woody made it loose. That helped me enormously.\"Silver Screen Collection / ContributorLos Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame through her role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Godfather films, before going on to feature in movies like Father of the Bride and Fellow First Wives Club.Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, like fellow US filmmaker Allen, also paid tribute to the \"extraordinary\" actress over the weekend.In a post shared on social media, Coppola said: \"Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful.\"From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor.\"He continued: \"I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall, while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend.\"Everything about Diane was creativity personified.\"",

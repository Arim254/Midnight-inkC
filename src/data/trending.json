    "body": "The Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport. We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop on weekends across BBC iPlayer, YouTube, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week's interview will be broadcast on BBC One from 23:50 BST on Saturday, 28 February. Leah Williamson has won almost everything there is to win in women's football. Twice a European champion as England captain, she has also lifted every trophy available to her during a 20-year career with Arsenal - including the Champions League and inaugural Women's Champions Cup.Now she wants the World Cup.In a wide-ranging interview, Williamson tells Kelly Somers she considered turning her back on football as a teenager before a conversation with her mum convinced her to stick with it. She also talks about her love of fashion and how music helps her switch off from the pressures of the day job.Kelly Somers: Leah, nice to see you - thank you for your time. Let's start with football. I want to know the first time you played football, your first memories and also - because of something you've just said to me off camera - how good were you?Leah Williamson: The first time I ever played football, my memory was at gymnastics. I must have been five or six. We were just waiting for our parents at the end to pick us up and the coach was a football fan, so we just got out a soft ball. My first proper memory is playing for my local team, but my mum says it was painful.Kelly: Because you weren't very good?!Leah: Yeah. She's like: 'You go and support your kids, but at the same time, it wasn't thrilling to watch. It's not like I was holding out that you were going to be a footballer.'Kelly: When you were little, though, it probably wasn't something that she would have envisaged for her daughter anyway, was it?Leah: No, definitely not. Especially because she couldn't have played football - she had to pretend to be a boy, so she's thinking, 'all right, we'll just see how far this goes'. I used to toe-punt it. I couldn't kick the ball properly until I was 10 or something.Kelly: That gives every parent of young children hope, listening to that!Leah: Yeah, there's no stress.Kelly: What was the name of your first team? What can you remember of it?Leah: Scots Youth FC. I was the only girl, but I was very well protected within my team. Still... with other teams, it wasn't great.Kelly: They targeted you, do you think, because you were the girl?Leah: It was more parents... like: 'Don't let her do that to you, she's a girl.'Kelly: I wonder what they're saying now. Those parents are probably like: 'I remember her.'Leah: If I saw them, they'd probably be like: 'Oh, we used to play together.' I'd be like: 'No, you used to give me a hard time.'Kelly: Was there a point where you thought, 'OK, I could make this. This is actually something that could be a career'? I imagine - going back to being a girl as well - it probably isn't something that's thought about quite as much...Leah: I had a conversation with my mum when I was about 15 and I said: 'I'm probably going to stop now.' She was like: 'All right, you tell them then.' I was too scared...Kelly: Did you actually, genuinely think...Leah: Yeah, we had a conversation out there in the car park and I was just like: 'I'm tired, you're tired, we're travelling a lot, it costs a lot of money and I'm not sure... it's a bit of a gamble, it's not professional.'My dad always said I'd be able to earn a wage one day. I don't know where he had that idea from, but he was very much like, 'keep going, follow your dreams' kind of thing, whereas I was a bit more pragmatic, I'd say. I'm a bit of a worrier and, also, I wasn't the loudest footballer, I wouldn't say. A couple of my team-mates would get chats from the first team and that wasn't really coming my way, so I was just being a bit realistic, like: 'Maybe it's not for me.' But I stuck it out.Kelly: It's a good job you did really, isn't it?Leah: I'm happy I did. But, yeah, I'd say once I got into the first team, I was still a bit like, 'all right, let's see what happens' and then I decided I didn't want to go to university. I think that's then why I fully committed. Then on my 18th birthday, I signed my professional contract. The other option for a lot of us was going to America and going to get a scholarship.Kelly: Did you consider that?Leah: Yeah - like Bend It Like Beckham... I'm watching that as a kid and thinking, 'yeah, I want to do that'. So, that was a consideration and then the game here just picked up, picked up, and I thought, 'I don't want to leave this - this is too exciting to not be a part of for me'.Kelly: Has there been a turning point? Like a moment where - other than that conversation you had with your mum - if it hadn't happened, maybe all of the success wouldn't have followed?Leah: The 2015 World Cup. Like, the prep camps - you'd normally bring in a bigger squad and you'd have these reserve players playing with you. I'd been playing for Arsenal and I'd done a season... so I'd turned a few heads, let's say.Kelly: People knew who you were?Leah: Yeah - and I got a call from the manager. It was Mark Sampson at the time. I'd just got injured, but he called me to say: 'I was going to bring you into the prep camp, but don't worry about your injury - hopefully there will be a next time.' It didn't happen for me then. I came back and it happened again. I'm not sure if I'd just missed my opportunity. I think that moment in my head... then I realised how much I cared about it. Instead of just letting things happen to me, I was like: 'No, I'm going to try.' And then the England call-up came and I think that was when I was like: 'This is like a career thing now.'Kelly: I was trying to second guess your answer for this, but I think it's impossible. If you could relive one match from your career, what would it be? We speak to a lot of people for this and they've got some good matches, but your list of good matches is up there.Leah: Yeah, it's up there. I wouldn't relive the Champions League final! I was in a lot of pain from start to finish - emotionally, physically. It was very warm, I was on the verge of sunstroke... I was not in a good place.Kelly: Just relive the celebrations if you want...Leah: Yeah, like the rest of it and the big picture - great. The game I would go back to is 2022 [the Euros final]. From the minute we walked out of the tunnel, I just... it was like playing a game where you just know you're going to win. Obviously I understand that there was a chance we weren't going to win, but everything about it just was like, 'no, we're going to win today'. It was really enjoyable from the minute it started. It was only when they scored that I thought...Kelly: 'This isn't the plan...'Leah: 'That is not what I thought was going to happen.' Extra time... just everything about it... Wembley, 90,000 people… insane. Insane.Kelly: And probably the impact after... did you realise quite what you'd done?Leah: I think it's very rare when you're living something that you realise what's happening... and I think everybody did such a good job to shut the world out from us during that tournament, whilst also drip-feeding enough for us to know.Kelly: Were they?Leah: I don't know if it was just being in England...Kelly: Did you shut yourself off from it?Leah: Yeah - just how I have my social media now. I don't see things that I don't want to see. I've set it all up to protect me in that way. I think when we went to Wembley... the helicopter followed us from the hotel in the coach, then you arrive at Wembley and there's just people everywhere. And then you come out to warm up and you think, 'we're basically playing a home fixture'. It felt like 90,000 England fans. It was just the most incredible…I don't assume anything will ever touch it, just because it was the home tournament... the first ever, you know.Kelly: It gives me goosebumps when we talk about it. I was there and I can remember the feeling. I think that everyone in the stadium that day felt that.Leah: I think that's the beauty of it - everybody knew what they were a part of. You can go deeper into the history of women's football, but you can also just go to the first trophy, for 56 years or whatever it was, that England had won.Kelly: It was a moment in history. It was a moment in time. I think we've seen since that it was life-changing for you guys, for so many people.Leah: It changed the landscape of football and I'm so happy that we won it because I think the country was ready to do something with it and I think we've seen that.Kelly: How's it changed your life?Leah: It changed everything. We just went from no-one knowing us to everybody knowing us overnight, kind of thing. It's a common understanding amongst all of us girls and we talk about it... we had to accept that we probably would never feel that way again. It was that big a moment and I think that does change your life. Does it give you a fuel to then go and do something else or is it like, 'I'm content with that'?Kelly: You mentioned there the fuel. It gave you the fuel to do it again, didn't it?Leah: It did. It did.Kelly: How does that compare?Leah: It's just completely different. 2025 Euros - I've never seen a group of people come together and just not give in. Obviously, for me, I was really injured by the time I got to the end of the final.Kelly: That's why I wasn't surprised that you didn't want to relive that game.Leah: It was more like a mental challenge of, 'you're OK, you're OK, you're OK'... which is very different to, 'I literally feel untouchable' in 2022.Kelly: Let's try and talk about you away from the pitch a little bit. What were you like, firstly, growing up? What was a young Leah Williamson like?Leah: Insufferable, I've been told by my cousins!Kelly: Your cousins?Leah: Yeah. We always joke because you lose confidence as you turn into an adult, I think. Obviously, you're fearless as a kid, but I was a bit of a performer, let's put it that way. I owned the spaces I went into. I was very much the same as I am now, in terms of being like... if I was told to do something, I did it that way and... quite a measured child, I would say, which is again quite insufferable.Kelly: You already mentioned family a few times. Because of your success they're everywhere with you, aren't they? Talk to me about your family dynamic and what it was like growing up and also... it feels like they've really been on the journey with you...Leah: Yeah, and they love it. Whatever your event is or whatever your thing is, everybody is there and everybody takes joy in it. Everyone takes pride in it, so obviously mine has ended up being this really high-profile thing, but my mum splits her time, my dad splits his time between me and my brother.My brother plays for our hometown team. I know I'm doing them proud and I love that, but they've bought into women's football and they're on that journey as well. My dad thinks I'm the best thing since sliced bread and I love him for that, but my mum has always been very real and very harsh as well, so I've always had both of those feedbacks. I think I was given a good foundation to then come into this world, which is tough to be in.Kelly: What's your ideal day off? How does Leah Williamson escape from football and everything that comes with it?Leah: I think I'm quite good at it.Kelly: Are you?Leah: Yeah, I think I am. I think it's a skill. You don't get that much time off so you have to be able to switch off as quickly as possible... to live in a different world... to then come back fresh. But for me, an ideal day? I don't know. No alarm, go to a concert, go to the theatre, something in the arts. Or even just the cinema, go for a nice meal. I love music, I love going out... the reason I love music is because I can't be thinking about football there.Kelly: Do you still play the piano?Leah: I actually just... for the first time since I learned to play the piano, I've just got a keyboard at home. So it's about to start up again.Kelly: It's getting serious!Leah: Yeah, it's about to start up again.Kelly: You're really into your fashion, aren't you?Leah: Yeah, I am. I like it. It's a form of expression.Kelly: Because even now, you're...Leah: I'm in the uniform. My job is uniform. And I don't mind that. I turn up to work, but the day off for me... I want to do something where I can then put something on that makes me feel good.Kelly: Tell me something about yourself that would surprise me.Leah: I mean, I don't think it's a secret I'm a loyal person. If you look at my career - I would do anything, I would drop anything, for my people - family, friends, partner, it doesn't matter. I think people sometimes think I'm a bit 'stush', if that makes sense.Kelly: Do you think?Leah: I think maybe sometimes. Like, I wear my heart on my sleeve - you have my opinions, you have my feelings. I get the mick taken out of me at the football. Beth [Mead] is always like, 'Leah, smile. Look like you're enjoying yourself,' and I think, 'all right, sorry,' and I remember. But I just get very protective of my space and once the outside world's shut off then I think I do change quite a lot compared to what goes out, if that makes sense.Kelly: I do understand. You've got a lot of pressure and a lot of eyes on you, though, and I guess your role has kind of changed. You've become, to many people, not just a footballer. Do you know what I mean?Leah: Yeah. It's a feasible thing to be yourself and move in different worlds at different times and still be really good at your job.Kelly: You've achieved so much. What else do you want to achieve? If you could only achieve one more thing, what would it be?Leah: The last thing on the list is obviously a World Cup. In the career that I've had, it's the last trophy.Kelly: It's no secret that all the other Lionesses that we've spoken to said exactly the same thing.Leah: The World Cup?Kelly: Yeah. Lucy [Bronze]... I don't think I'd finished my sentence...Leah: ..she said World Cup?Kelly: And then she said it. Which probably wouldn't surprise you, knowing Lucy either.Leah: No, no. I speak to my team-mates and I'm like, 'Mariona [Caldentey], you have one... do you want to do a swap... or how does this work?'Kelly: Maybe they'll let you have the next one.Leah: Yeah. Everybody wants it and the stage of women's football now, it's just so unpredictable. There's so many good teams - it becomes so much harder, which I think only makes you want it more.Kelly: Leah, thank you so much for your time. I could have spoken for ages. Thank you.Leah: Thanks for having me.",

Early voting has begun in the primaries and Democrats are hopeful they could win a Texas senate seat for the first time in over 30 years. \nThe election will have national consequences - Texas is one of America’s political power centres and Republicans from here have dominated the national agenda from immigration, to the courts, to reshaping electoral districts. Taking back Texas could help Democrats take back the House, the Senate, and check Trump’s executive power in a way they have so far been unable to do in his second term. It could also realign the presidential election in 2028.  \nJustin and Anthony, who grew up in Texas and knows its politics well, unpack the primaries, which are fast becoming the most expensive in modern US history. On the Republican side, there is meltdown and infighting, as Senator John Cornyn faces a serious challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton.  The US president, who is campaigning in Texas, has not yet endorsed one candidate. \nOn the Democrat side, two of its biggest stars are fighting for the nomination. Jasmine Crockett, well known for her fiery public battles with the Trump administration and James Talarico, who is tipped as a future Democrat presidential candidate. We look at what their realistic chances are, and what it tells us about the future of the party.  \nPresenter: Justin Webb, Radio 4, and Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nProducer: Purvee Pattni, Grace Reeve, Sophie van Brugen and Kris Jalowiecki\nSound engineer: Rohan Madison\nSenior news editor: Sam Bonham\nGet in touch:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nIf you want to be notified every time we publish a new episode, please subscribe to us on BBC Sounds by hitting the subscribe button on the app.\nYou can now listen to Americast on a smart speaker.

He was taken into custody and charged just before 04:00 on Saturday.The Metropolitan Police said he had been remanded into custody and was due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court later.In the early hours of Friday, graffiti including \"Never again is Now\", \"Free Palestine\" and \"Globalise the Intifada\" appeared on the statue of the former prime minister in central London.In December, both the Met and Greater Manchester Police announced anyone found using \"globalise the intifada\" would face arrest.A representative of 10 Downing Street said the graffiti was \"completely abhorrent\", adding that \"the perpetrator must be held to account\".A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Sir Winston Churchill is a figure of great national pride. The vile vandals defacing this statue are a disgrace.\"The wartime prime minister's statue has been vandalised several times in the past, including during protests.In June 2020, it was scrawled with graffiti accusing Churchill of being a racist, during a Black Lives Matter protest triggered by the death of George Floyd in the US.Later that year, an activist for environmental group Extinction Rebellion was ordered to pay more than £1,500 for defacing the statue by painting \"racist\" on its plinth during a climate protest.The 12ft (3.6m) monument, created by Ivor Roberts-Jones, was unveiled in 1973 by the wartime prime minister's widow Lady Churchill.",

Carol, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do, Bad Blood, Laughter in the Rain and Calendar Girl, has died at the age of 86.\"Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather,\" his family confirmed in a statement.  \"A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.\"Sedaka, a skilled pianist nominated for five Grammy awards, also wrote hits for several other famous musicians in his six-decades-long career. His family did not disclose his cause of death or where he died.The Brooklyn native and student of the famed Julliard School in New York was a founder of the doo-wop group The Tokens in the late 1950s. After producing several hits through the early 1960s, he later returned to Billboard's Top 10 chart in 1975 after writing the song Love Will Keep Us Together for duo Captain & Tennille. He also recorded several albums for Elton John's record label in the 1970s.He wrote his first hit song with his neighbour while still a teenager. Connie Francis recorded and released \"Stupid Cupid\" in 1958. Sedaka's popular music faded from the spotlight later in the 1960s, as the British Invasion era took hold of the US.\"It's wonderful for the soul to be able to play classical music,\" he said.\"But to travel around, playing your own lyrics and music is a very rewarding feeling and I chose that, and I have no regrets.\"",

    "body": "First writing may be 40,000 years earlier than thought2 days agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterUniversity of Tübingen / Hildegard JensenA 40,000-year-old mammoth figurine with engraved rows of crosses and dotsThe history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.The researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects like mammoth tusks as old as 45,000 years in caves in Germany.Traditionally historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts made around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia.The precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.The objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved to Europe from Africa where they interacted with Neanderthals.Until now it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.The work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artifacts,\" she says.The team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.Some of the objects are from a 37-km long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.Landesmuseum Württemberg / Hendrik ZwietaschThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots. On a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.And on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.They believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.The researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum / Olaf M. TesmerA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago \"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.The clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.They found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.The team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Paleolithic people.\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.The research is published in the journal PNAS.",

The extent of any damage is unclear and the US has not commented. Elsewhere across the region, explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait - also homes to US military bases. In Doha, Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted several missiles apparently targeting the al-Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the region.Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement it had launched the retaliatory operation \"Truthful Promise 4\", targeting US assets in the region. Bahrain's state news agency confirmed the attack on the US base. It later said it had successfully intercepted a number of missiles that had entered its airspace. In Israel, sirens were heard across the country after the Israeli military said it had detected an incoming Iranian missile barrage.The defence ministry of the United Arab Emirates said in a statement that the country has been subjected to a \"a blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\".\"UAE air defence systems dealt with the missiles with high efficiency and successfully intercepted a number of missiles,\" it added. It said debris fell on a residential area in Abu Dhabi, causing some material damage and killing a civilian. The US Air Force operates from Al Dhafra Air Base, south of Abu Dhabi, along with the UAE Air Force.",

    "body": "6 days agoLinda SinclairBBC ScotlandMorag SkeltonHamish has joined Morag on a number of expeditionsExperienced mountaineer Morag Skelton has been climbing and skiing in Scotland's mountains all her adult life. But she has recently added a new challenge to her adventures - taking along her nine-month-old baby.Hamish has joined Morag on cross-country skiing expeditions, island-hopping camping trips and has even spent a night in a bothy.Morag, 34, who lives in Inverness, says that because the outdoors have always brought her so much joy it was only natural she would want to share that with her son.And she loves to see his reactions to the landscape and wildlife they encounter on their adventures.Morag SkeltonMorag says Hamish is happiest being outsideMorag is an outdoor instructor at Glenmore Lodge, Scotland's national outdoor training centre.She says Hamish is generally a happy baby - and that he's happiest being outside. The only time he complains is when he's hungry.She says: \"Babies and kids thrive in the outdoors because of the endless natural sensory play - from the smell of fresh air and the pine forest to the touch of the varying textures to the sound of the trees swaying and the rivers running.\"Morag says there is no need to pack lots of toys on these trips because sensory learning is free.And when asked about the risks of taking a baby into the great outdoors, she says Hamish's safety takes priority over everything else.With her professional outdoor training she can anticipate any potential challenges, monitor the weather, map read and assess the risks before any trips.Morag SkeltonMorag has taken Hamish camping during their adventuresMorag SkeltonMorag SkeltonMorag says she personally finds it beneficial to be in nature.\"I find my own mental state is at its calmest outside whereas at home I can be overloaded with the chaos of housework,\" she says.On one trip Morag hiked for 90 minutes to a remote bothy with six-month-old Hamish on her back in a child carrier.They were accompanied by her friend Nicola Cameron, and both women also brought their pet dogs.Bothies are basic shelters, where there is generally no electricity or running water.Morag said Hamish was at \"the ideal age where I didn't have to carry solid food for him yet and he wasn't yet crawling\".Morag SkeltonThe visit to a remote bothy involved a 90-minute hikeThe trip was made easier with Nicola being there as she helped \"keep spirits high\". The old university friends were able to catch up over the tealight candles while Hamish slept in Morag's arms.Along with all the kit to consider for an overnight trip - including sleeping bags, a stove, food and clothes - Morag also had to pack eight nappies.She conceded that was a \"big faff\" as she then had to take them all home with her.Morag SkeltonMorag also brought the family's dog Aila on the island-hopping tripMorag SkeltonMorag SkeltonMorag, her husband Jamie, Hamish and their pet dog Aila on a walk near BraemarMorag's favourite adventure with Hamish so far was an island-hopping wild camping trip to the Isles of Muck and Eigg in the Inner Hebrides last September.That was her first overnight journey away with her son, who was just three months old at the time.Morag, who used a three-wheel buggy to transport Hamish, says she kept the logistics very simple and camped a short 20-minute walk away from the ferry terminal.She said the trip felt more adventurous as they were away from busy roads and praised the friendly island community.Morag added that she was \"determined that my outdoorsy lifestyle can continue whilst having a family\".She said: \"Witnessing my baby experience these adventures for the very first time is special.\"I love seeing his facial expressions as he absorbs the landscapes, wildlife and different things around him.\"Stories you may have missed",

    "body": "2 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPA MediaShabana Mahmood visited a removals centre in Denmark this week to examine how its policies workHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood is to press ahead with reforms to the asylum and immigration system, despite the loss of a once-safe Labour seat to the Greens in the Gorton and Denton by-election.The Green Party has criticised Labour's stance on immigration – with its leader Zack Polanski recently accusing the party of echoing \"the racist rhetoric of the far right\". The Greens have also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work.Following their victory on Thursday, some Labour MPs have warned ministers not to try to \"out-Reform Reform [UK]\".But a source close to Mahmood told the BBC that the government should not learn the wrong lessons from the result - and that it was \"wrong\" to assume Muslim voters were deserting Labour over immigration. Left-wing Labour MPs are now calling for a change of approach.Richard Burgon – of the Socialist Campaign Group – told the BBC it was time to \"ditch the approach of aping Reform and kicking the left which has alienated so many people who have voted Labour previously\".Apsana Begum said a number of factors including immigration had played into the \"catastrophic result\" for Labour, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Someone has to take responsibility.\"If some in Labour are now queasy about the home secretary's approach, sources are suggesting that the alternative was the \"far right raising up the drawbridge\" and putting in jeopardy the future of the asylum system - and even of the Labour Party itself.Mahmood herself has said that illegal immigration was putting immense strain on the country and undermining the contract between the government and its citizens.Mahmood visited reception and removal centres for asylum seekers near Copenhagen, the Danish capital, this week, to examine how a tougher set of policies was working in practice. Danish government policies influenced Labour's proposals for asylum reform aimed at reducing incentives for people to enter the UK illegally, and the home secretary is expected to begin implementing some of them from next week.These include making most migrants wait for up to 10 years - rather than the current five – before being able to apply for permanent residence, with refugees waiting for up to 20 years. The proposals also included offering only temporary protection to those whose asylum claims have been accepted - and reducing the number of appeals that unsuccessful applicants can lodge. This is not as far as Reform UK has said it is willing to go.Its home affairs spokesman Zia Yusuf said Mahmood was \"all talk and no action\", and that the government could not fix the immigration system while it was \"chained\" to the European Convention on Human Rights (EHCR).He said a Reform government would leave the ECHR immediately and \"completely abolish indefinite leave to remain\", as well as imposing visa bans on countries refusing returns and \"criminalise aiding illegal entry, regardless of intent\". Mahmood is expected to double down on her approach in a speech next week.She will seek to make a \"Labour case\" for \"firm and fair\" Danish-style immigration policies.Imran Hussain, from the Refugee Council, a charity, was sceptical about proceeding with new asylum and immigration rules.He said that \"the big lesson of recent years was that tough talking\" did not lead to \"smart action\" and the government should instead focus on the \"basics\" - swifter asylum decisions, swifter appeals and help for refugees to integrate.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJaroslav LukivWatch: Crowds clash with police after Bolivian plane crashAt least 15 people have been killed and others injured after a Bolivian air force cargo plane crashed in the western city of El Alto, the country's authorities say.The incident happened at 18:15 local time (22:15 GMT) on Friday as the plane was arriving at El Alto's airport from the city of Santa Cruz, aviation officials said. It reportedly skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles.The defence ministry later confirmed its C-130 Hercules was involved and that it had been transporting banknotes to the Central Bank of Bolivia. There were eight people aboard the plane, the air force commander said.Police fired tear gas to disperse crowds allegedly trying to take the scattered banknotes.Video footage showed the plane on the ground and badly damaged vehicles. In other videos, people could be seen running away from the tear gas and police officers, some holding shields, forming a line. Some in the crowds are seen throwing rocks. \"While news crews were covering the accident, individuals attempting to steal the transported money attacked the press with unusual violence,\" the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia said in a statement. It said a mobile TV unit was \"directly targeted\", while other journalists \"were attacked with stones, suffering serious injuries while carrying out their work\". The government-run Bolivian News Agency reported that at least a dozen people were arrested for stealing banknotes.  ReutersBolivian banknotes were seen scattered at the crash site\"I want to make it clear to those who are trying to take money from the plane involved in this tragedy that this money has no legal value since it has not been issued by the Central Bank and does not have a serial number, and that attempting to use this money is a crime,\" the Minister of Defence, Marcelo Salinas, said. \"We also ask all those who are engaging in acts of vandalism in this area to refrain from doing so and to respect the mourning and grief we are experiencing at this difficult time.\"Bolivia's Air Force commander Sergio Lora confirmed there were eight crew members on board the plane \"including cargo personnel and flight crew\".Bolivia's health ministry said 31 people were injured in the incident. It also issued an urgent appeal for blood donations. El Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash.\"My sister told me that she was in the car when the plane crashed. The plane's tire fell on the car, and my sister was injured because the impact of the tire hit her on the head, so we rushed her to the hospital,\" a man told the Reuters news agency.It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but some witnesses said the  weather at the time was treacherous.\"A heavy hailstorm\" was falling and \"there was lightning\" when the plane went down,\" a woman whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage told the AFP news agency.An investigation into the incident is under way.",

    "body": "12 hours agoCaroline LowbridgeEast MidlandsPlatform Home OwnershipFormer police officer Phil James - pictured here receiving a cheque on behalf of the charity - founded Drone to Home and was its CEOThe charity regulator for England and Wales has reported its concerns about an animal charity to police in line with its \"policy on evidence of potential criminal activity\".The Charity Commission's report comes after former Drone to Home volunteers told the BBC the charity had been exaggerating how many dogs it finds in what they described as an attempt to increase donations and sponsorship.Drone to Home was founded by former Nottinghamshire Police officer Phil James in 2022 and quickly became well-known, with more than 154,000 Facebook followers and widespread media coverage.The BBC has asked James and the charity's remaining trustee to comment but they have not responded.Four women said they felt intimidated when James followed them around and filmed themDrone to Home announced its intention to close on 22 November, after the BBC sent James and the charity a \"right of reply\" letter, outlining allegations we were intending to report and the testimony gathered from former volunteers.However, the regulator said its role was to \"oversee trustees' compliance with charity law duties and responsibilities\", and \"not to investigate allegations of a criminal nature\".A Charity Commission spokesperson said: \"After concerns were raised with us about Drone to Home, we opened a regulatory compliance case to assess these further and gather more information.\"In line with our policy on evidence of potential criminal activity, we reported our concerns to the police.\"Based on the information available to us, we have since determined there is no further role for the Commission as charity regulator. However, we continue to engage with the charity on its closure.\"Sadie accused Drone to Home of misleading Facebook followersIt claimed to have reunited thousands of dogs and other pets with their owners, and was largely funded by donations from the public.However, four former Drone to Home volunteers claimed to the BBC the charity had been exaggerating how many dogs it reunited with owners.Volunteers from other animal search and rescue (SAR) organisations also told the BBC they thought the charity had been using Facebook posts to falsely give the impression it was responsible for finding lost dogs that had been found by other rescue groups.Volunteer drone pilot Kevin Gunn played an answerphone message James left for his employerNumerous people also raised concerns about the behaviour of James.Four women - including one former Drone to Home volunteer - told the BBC they felt intimidated when he followed them around and filmed them as they helped in the search for a lost dog in Long Clawson in Leicestershire.In another incident, James contacted a volunteer drone pilot's employer and left a voicemail falsely accusing him of \"abusing my staff on social media\".Another former Drone to Home volunteer was also sent a fake legal letter, accusing her of defamation after she raised concerns about the charity with a friend.It purported to be from a barristers' chambers called 7BR, which told the BBC it had \"reported this incident to the police on the basis that someone appears to have fraudulently misused the 7BR letterhead\".The BBC asked Drone to Home and James about all of these matters, and he responded by disputing the claims and threatening the corporation with legal action.The letter appeared to originate from the 7BR barristers' chambers, which has reported the matter to policeThe charity's Facebook page closed on 24 November and the website closed on 20 December.The Charity Commission said it intended to dissolve the charity after three months from 5 February, which was the date it published a notification on its register.The charity has been reported to Nottinghamshire Police by the Charity Commission. Nottinghamshire Police declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "39 minutes agoAleks PhillipsReutersPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has chaired a Cobra meeting about the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran.Explosions have been heard across multiple Iranian cities including the capital, Tehran, on Saturday, after negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear programme ended without an agreement this week. The UK did not participate in the strikes.Iran has launched retaliatory strikes, Israel's military says, with explosions heard and attacks reported in several other countries in the region with US facilities.The situation has caused disruption to air travel.The emergency committee Cobra, which involves ministers and officials, meets to co-ordinate the government's response to an emerging situation.\"Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that is why we have continually supported efforts to reach a negotiated solution,\" a government spokesperson said.\"Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance.\"They added: \"We do not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict.\"British people in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been told by the UK Foreign Office to immediately shelter in place following reports of missile attacks.UK nationals in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman have been told to \"remain vigilant\" and take shelter if advised to do so.Following the strikes on Iran early on Saturday morning, explosions and air raid sirens have already been heard in Qatar's capital, Doha, which is host to a US military facility. Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted Iranian missiles.Bahraini state news is also reporting the service centre of the US Navy's 5th Fleet based in the Gulf nation had been \"subjected to a missile attack\".Donald Trump has described the strikes as the start of \"major combat operations\" and called for Iranian government forces to lay down their arms.The US president urged Iranians to shelter until the operation had finished.Iran's Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) promised a \"crushing\" response to the US-Israeli attacks.Flights cancelled and divertedMany major airlines that serve the Middle East have diverted or cancelled flights over safety concerns.British Airways has cancelled services to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until Wednesday, and Amman in Jordan on Saturday.More than 200 passengers on the carrier's 20:00 flight to Doha on Friday found themselves back at Heathrow after it was ordered to turn around about a third of the way through the journey.Virgin Atlantic said it cancelled a Heathrow to Dubai flight and warned that its flights to India, Saudi Arabia and the Maldives may take longer due as they had to be rerouted.Wizz Air confirmed it has suspended all flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman up until and including next Saturday.Qatar Airways confirmed the temporary suspension of its flights to and from its capital Doha due to the closure of Qatari airspace, while Emirates said it was temporarily stopping services to and from Dubai.Heathrow, the UK's busiest airport, urged travellers to check with their airline for updates.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she stood with the US and Israel \"as they take on the threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its vile regime\".Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he prayed \"for the right outcome for the wonderful Persian people\" as \"attacks against this evil regime in Iran begin\".Additional reporting by Matt Cole and Marc Ashdown",

    "body": "11 minutes agoJeremy BowenInternational editorReutersSmoke rises above Tehran after strikeThe decision by the United States and Israel to plunge into a new war with Iran creates a highly dangerous moment with unpredictable consequences. Israel used the word \"pre-emptive\" to justify its attack.The evidence is that this is not a response to an imminent threat, which the word pre-emption implies. Instead, it is a war of choice. Israel and the United States have calculated that the Islamic regime in Iran is vulnerable; dealing with a severe economic crisis, the fallout from the brutal crackdown on protesters at the start of the year and with defences still badly damaged by last summer's war. Their conclusion seems to have been that this was an opportunity that should not be squandered.It is also another blow to the tottering system of international law. In their statements, both President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran was a danger to their countries – Trump said it was a global danger. The Islamic regime is certainly their bitter enemy. But it is hard to see how the legal justification of self-defence applies given the huge disparity of power between the US and Israel on one side and Iran on the other.War is a political act.  Armed conflict is inherently hard to control once it starts. Leaders need clear objectives.Benjamin Netanyahu has seen Iran as Israel's most dangerous enemy for decades. For him, this is a chance to do as much damage as possible to the regime in Tehran and to Iran's military capacity. Netanyahu also faces a general election later in the year. The evidence from the two years of war with Hamas is that he believes his political position strengthens when Israel is at war.Donald Trump's objectives have veered and changed, characteristically. Back in January, he told protesters in Iran that help was on its way. Much of the US Navy was busy removing the leader of Venezuela at the time, so he lacked military options. While the US was deploying two carrier strike groups to the region, as well as considerable land-based firepower, Trump talked a lot about the dangers of Iran's nuclear ambitions, even though after last summer's war, Trump declared that the Iranian nuclear programme had been \"obliterated\". The Iranian regime has always denied that it wants a nuclear weapon, but it has enriched uranium to a level that has no civilian use in a nuclear power programme. At the very least, it seems to want the option of building a bomb. So far Israel and the US have published no evidence that it was about to happen.In his video, Trump told Iranian people that \"the hour of freedom\" was at hand. Netanyahu had a similar message, that the war will present the people of Iran with the chance to overthrow the regime. That is not at all certain. There is no precedent for regime change happening just because of air strikes. Saddam Hussein of Iraq was overthrown in 2003 by a huge US-led invasion force. Muammar Gaddafi of Libya was overthrown in 2011 by rebel forces that were provided with an air force by Nato and some Arab states. In both cases the result was the collapse of the state, civil war and thousands of killings. Libya is still a failed state. Iraq is still dealing with consequences of the invasion and the bloodletting that followed.Even if this becomes the first case of air power alone collapsing a regime, the Islamic regime will not be replaced by a liberal democracy that upholds human rights. There is no credible alternative government in exile waiting in the wings. Over almost half a century the Iranian regime has created a complex political system that is underpinned by a mix of ideology, corruption and when required, the ruthless use of force. The Tehran regime demonstrated in January that it was prepared to kill protestors. It has security forces that obey orders to shoot and kill thousands of fellow citizens for challenging the system on the streets and demanding freedom.Perhaps the US and Israel are trying to kill the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel believes in the power of assassination as a strategy. In the last two years it killed the leaders of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and many of their lieutenants.The Islamic regime in Iran is a different matter. It presides over a state, not an armed movement. It not a one-man show. If the supreme leader was killed, he would be replaced, most likely by another cleric supported by the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which exists alongside the conventional armed forces with the explicit task of defending the regime against threats at home and abroad.Trump offered them immunity if they laid down their arms or certain death. The IRGC is unlikely to be tempted by his offer. Martyrdom is a constant motif in the ideology of the Islamic Republic and in Shia Islam. Trump believes that the primary motivating force in politics and life is transactional – as his book puts it, the art of the deal. But dealing with Iran requires factoring in the power of ideology and belief. That is much harder to measure.As this crisis has built since the turn of the year, and America assembled its armada, there have been increasing signs that the leadership in Tehran saw war as unavoidable. They engaged in talks, conscious that talks were going on last summer when Israel attacked and the US joined them. They do not trust the US or the Israelis. In his first term Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, which restricted the Iranian nuclear programme and was the marquee foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration. There have been signs that Iran might have been prepared to accept a JCPOA mark two deal, at the very least to buy time. But the US appears to have also been demanding severe restrictions on its missile programme and its support for regional allies that oppose Israel and the US.That was unacceptable to them, amounting to a capitulation. Giving up missiles and allies might even in the minds of the leadership make it much more vulnerable to regime change than the threat – and now reality – of attack.Iran's leaders will now be calculating how to ride out the war, how to survive and how to manage its consequences. Their neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia, will be dismayed by the huge uncertainty and potential consequences of today's events. Given the capacity of the Middle East to export trouble, the eruption of renewed and intensified war deepens the instability of region and wider world that is already turbulent, violent and dangerous.",

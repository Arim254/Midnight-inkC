    "body": "38 minutes agoChancellor Rachel Reeves continues to face backlash over accusations she misled the public on the state of the nation's economy, with the story prominent on many of Sunday's papers. \"Reeves must go,\" is the consensus from voters who took part in a poll conducted by the Mail on Sunday. The paper reports that a majority of those who took part in the poll are in favour of Reeves quitting.The prime minister is also being drawn into the scandal, with the Sunday Telegraph saying Sir Keir Starmer was aware there was no black hole in public finances but still approved Reeves' speech about the need for tax rises in the Budget. The paper quotes No 10 saying the chancellor's speech was \"entirely accurate\", adding that the PM was aware of the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) figures and the \"content of the speech\".The Sunday Times keeps its focus on the PM, reporting that Sir Keir will vow to tackle the cost of living crisis next week in an attempt to pivot attention away from the embattled chancellor. The PM will pledge to scrap \"misguided\" regulations and root out unforeseen costs in the country's economy, the paper says.The Budget's impact on working families leads the Sunday Express. The paper cites a new report that says working families with three children will need to earn £71,000 to match the welfare benefits of a similar jobless household as a result of Reeves scrapping the two-child benefit cap.The Observer fills its front page with a black and white tribute to playwright Tom Stoppard, who has died aged 88. The paper also features a famous quote from Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead: \"Words, words. They're all we have to go on.\"The Independent shifts its attention to the war in Ukraine, spotlighting an interview with a Russia expert and former top White House adviser. Fiona Hill, a security adviser during Donald Trump's first administration, warns that Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"manipulating\" the US leader and \"doesn't want peace\".Moving on to entertainment news, the Sunday Mirror previews an interview with I'm a Celebrity contestant Alex Scott. Scott told the paper of her concern when her partner, singer Jess Glynne, wasn't there to meet her when she was voted out of the Jungle. Glynne's mother had suffered a stroke and required urgent surgery.In other TV news, hit BBC crime drama This City has been struck by real-life criminals, the Daily Star reports. The paper says a crew member had his room ransacked and personal belongings stolen while the series was filming its second series in Spain.Finally, the Sun splashes its front page with an interview with TV personality Freddy Brazier's former partner. Holly Swinburn details their troubled relationship, telling the paper: \"Enough is enough, I don't' know if he can change.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "More than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. The death toll has continued to rise since a ceasefire took effect on 10 October, with Israel carrying out air strikes for what it says are violations of the truce - while bodies continue to be recovered from under the rubble.Among those reportedly killed in an Israeli drone strike on Saturday were two young brothers, Fadi and Juma Abu Assi, whose family said they had been gathering firewood when they were killed. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC they had struck two suspects who had crossed the so-called yellow line.The line marks where the Israeli military agreed to withdraw to under a ceasefire brokered by the United States more than seven weeks ago.The boys who died have been described in media reports as an eight-year-old and his brother, aged 10 or 11.Relatives said the children had been looking for firewood east of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip when they were killed.Their funeral was held at Nasser Hospital on Saturday.Figures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.Gaza's Health Ministry says the Palestinian toll is now 70,100 and that more than 350 of those deaths have happened since the 10 October ceasefire. The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "body": "9 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterZarah Sultana has accused leading figures in the new party she is founding with Jeremy Corbyn of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" to purge left-wing activists.Sultana boycotted the first day of the founding conference of the project, currently operating under the name Your Party, after several members who also belonged to the Socialist Workers Party were expelled.Party officials said the expulsions were for breaching rules that ban members from joining any other political party in the UK or abroad.Sultana's comments came as Corbyn used his conference speech to call for unity as the party had \"a unique opportunity\" to found \"a socialist party of mass appeal\".She told the BBC one of her staff had also been denied a pass for the conference. Your Party officials confirmed a pass had not been issued but denied the decision had been politically motivated. A spokesperson for Sultana said: \"This witch hunt is indefensible - we must build a party that welcomes all socialists.\"Asked by the BBC if she stood by the claim there was a witch hunt, Sultana said: \"Absolutely.\"\"And it is disgusting to see the type of behaviour we have seen in the Labour Party,\" she added. \"It's a toxic culture we're not seeking to replicate here.\"Sultana said \"nameless and faceless bureaucrats\" were \"working in the shadows\" to expel people \"without the membership actually voting on it\".Members of other groups \"shouldn't be made to choose\" between their membership and \"our new party\", Sultana said.A Your Party spokesman said: \"Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules - and these rules were enforced. \"We're focused on hosting a democratic founding conference with thousands of members coming together to debate and decide the big issues. \"This is politics outside the Westminster mould: from the ground up, not the top down.\"During his speech, Corbyn admitted there had been \"mistakes\" during the party's turbulent founding - a process that has seen Sultana frequently at odds with party officials and two MPs resign from the project.Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed quit within a week of each other, citing internal tensions.Before leaving, both Hussain and Mohamed had put their names to a letter criticising Sultana for failing to transfer an estimated £800,000 of Your Party donations held by a company she controls.The money is held by MoU Operations Ltd, which collected the initial waves of donations while Your Party was being formally registered.Sultana has transferred £600,000, promising any remaining money will be paid \"as soon as possible, as the legal details are ironed out\".Speaking on Saturday, Corbyn said: \"As a party, we've got to come together and be united, because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent.\"He also called for \"public, democratic ownership\" of the water industry, led a chant of \"free, free Palestine\" and urged party members to \"campaign forevermore for real socialism and real social justice\".",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".In a statement on Saturday, Venezuela's foreign ministry said that the US had \"unilaterally suspended\" its weekly migrant repatriation flights.\"We call directly on the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organizations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression,\" it said.Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "Australian children's music group The Wiggles has issued a statement after two of its members were featured in a music video for a song that apparently alludes to drug use.In the since-deleted clip for musician Keli Holiday's new song, Ecstasy, Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and his nephew Dominic Field, who plays the Tree of Wisdom, could be seen dancing in the background.A spokesperson for The Wiggles said the group \"does not condone\" the use of drugs \"in any form\" and that the video had been created without the band's approval.The TikTok video was viewed more than 92,000 times before it was taken down, Australian media report.\"We understand that a video circulating on social media has caused concern for many parents and professionals, and we want to address that directly,\" the group said in a statement to The West Australian newspaper. \"The Wiggles do not support or condone the use of drugs in any form. The content being shared was not created or approved by us, and we have asked for it to be removed.\"While Keli Holiday is a friend of The Wiggles, the video and the music added to it were created independently and without our knowledge.\"The clip was filmed at the TikTok Awards earlier this month where members of the band appeared on stage with Holiday - whose real name is Adam Hyde - during his song Dancing2. Holiday shared the video on TikTok, with the caption \"The Wiggles get it\",  to promote his new single Ecstasy. The song's chorus lyrics are: \"Hey girl, come on dance with me. You and your pocket full of ecstasy.\"A spokesperson for The Wiggles told The West Australian newspaper that the band's performances at the awards had been \"family-friendly\" and that the video had been \"edited together separately and without our awareness\".Created in 1991 as part of a university assignment, The Wiggles has become an international phenomenon among young children. Anthony Fields is the only original member still with the group.Keli Holiday is the solo project of Hyde, who is also known for being one half of electronic dance duo Peking Duk.The BBC has contacted Holiday's management for comment.",

    "body": "5 days agoWill VernonYury KrylovA British child chess prodigy has swept the board at a national competition, earning her a place among the top 50 women in the world for the blitz category of speed chess.Ten-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan won eight games in a row at the UK Women's Blitz Championship in Royal Leamington Spa at the weekend - triumphing over much older and more experienced players.\"I don't mind who I compete against, I only care about the game,\" Bodhana told the BBC following her latest win.Malcolm Pein, from the English Chess Federation, described Bodhana as a \"generational talent with no equivalent in any other sport\".\"It's hard to say what is more remarkable - the fact that a 10-year-old is a top seed in a British chess championship, or that she strolls to victory by a huge margin, leaving three other England internationals in her wake,\" he added.Bodhana, from Harrow in north-west London, said she was \"really happy\" about her victory. \"Chess helps me with so many other things, at school it helps with maths, art and music.\"Her father, Siva, said his daughter was very determined, and he and his wife were proud of her: \"She is doing her best, and we are supporting her.\"It is the latest success in Bodhana's phenomenal career. In August, she became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title - the second-highest ranking in women's chess, below grandmaster.  Yury KrylovBodhana became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title earlier this yearLast year, she made history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport, at the age of just nine. Bodhana says she wants to become the youngest grandmaster in history. The current recordholder is American chess player Abhimanyu Mishra, who claimed the title at the age of just 12. Blitz is a type of speed chess in which each game lasts no more than ten minutes.",

    "body": "Flooding across Asia leaves 600 dead and hundreds missing8 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, with hundreds still missingTorrential rains have triggered floods and landslides across parts of southern Asia, killing around 600 people.Monsoon rain exacerbated by tropical storms caused some of the region's worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.Intense rainfall began on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday. \"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told Reuters news agency. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" With hundreds still missing, the death toll is likely to rise. Thousands remain stranded, some awaiting rescue on rooftops.As of Saturday more than 300 people had died in Indonesia and 160 in Thailand. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.In Sri Lanka, which has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, more than 130 people are dead and some 170 missing, officials said.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.Indonesia's disaster agency said on Saturday that nearly 300 people were still missing after flooding devastated Sumatra.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 160 people have been killed, the government said on Saturday. More than 3.8 million people have been affected.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day, the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, employees were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that lost family members. Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state under water, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters in recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.Climate change has altered storm patterns, including the intensity and duration of the season, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.Getty ImagesSri Lanka's government has declared a state of emergency and appealed for international assistanceMore on this story",

The organisers said they were protesting \"against our Government's complicity in genocide and against the ban on [direct action group] Palestine Action\". Palestine Action was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 in July.In Bristol city centre, 31 people were arrested, while in Manchester, 34 were held at a rally attended by 200.In Birmingham, 25 protesters carrying placards expressing support for Palestine Action were arrested at a rally in Chamberlain Square in the city centre, West Midlands Police said.Ch Insp James Littlehales said: \"We fully recognise people's right to demonstrate peacefully, and many people continue to protest in support of Palestine without breaking the law.\"But we will take appropriate action where people are breaching the law by showing support for proscribed organisations.\"Greater Manchester Police said it had detained 34 protesters in St Peter's Square for suspected terror offences.PAThousands of demonstrators marched in London at a separate rally organised by Palestine CoalitionIn Bristol, demonstrators congregated at College Green and 30 people were arrested on suspicion of displaying articles in support of a proscribed organisation.One woman was held on suspicion of failing to provide details under the Police Reform Act, Avon and Somerset Police said.Insp Ben Spence said: \"The protest has now safely concluded and the police operation has been stood down.\"Officers also arrested 10 protesters in Norwich. Norfolk Police said a group of people were being held under the Terrorism Act on suspicion of holding placards that showed support for Palestine Action.A separate protest in London organised by the Palestine Coalition attracted about 100,000 demonstrators, the group said. Five arrests were made for suspected affray and Public Order Act offences, according to the Met Police.Many of those gathered in the capital carried Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel slogans as they walked from Green Park to Whitehall.Some set off green and red fireworks as they walked down Piccadilly in central London.Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after Hamas-led militants based in the Palestinian territory attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251.At least 70,100 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "It's time to lock in and let your winter arc begin1 hour agoGeorge SandemanBBCDani compares locking in to tunnel vision and says it helps her get things doneHave you ever locked in?No, not finding yourself locked in a lift or a bathroom.We're talking about locking IN - the phrase you might have seen on social media or heard people saying lately. To lock in is to focus; to endure short-term pain for long-term gain - whether that be building your body or your business. Do it today - not tomorrow. Everything else is a distraction.Motivational and ironic videos feature the phrase, which has been searched for online more this year than ever before, according to Google. So how exactly are people locking in and is it helping or hindering them?Locking in at the library\"My generation thrives off romanticising things,\" says Dani, a 20-year-old student at the University of Manchester.\"I feel like locking in is a way of romanticising getting into your deep work and making that decision of like, 'okay, it's time to get stuff done'.\" She compares it to tunnel vision.In her case it was a marathon revision session until 3am recently ahead of 10 hours in exam labs the following day. Her phone was kept on silent; electro-beats hummed in the background; digestive biscuits were devoured.@daniistypingtooDani thinks locking in is a way for her generation to romanticise the idea of working hardIn recent weeks as the nights have drawn in and days become colder, some influencers have been telling followers to stop missing the summer and see this as the perfect opportunity to lock in - to embrace their winter arc.\"I think it comes from TV shows and anime where you have characters with a villain arc,\" says Dani. She thinks feeling as though you are on a transformative journey of your own helps you stay on track with the tasks necessary to achieve your goals.Locking in on streamsKaragii agrees. She has turned her passion for gaming into a living and now works as a professional content creator in that industry - she locked in.For her, the phrase also serves as a personal rallying cry because of the sexism she faces \"almost every other day\" when playing games online. Her streams can last 11 hours so she has to ensure she eats regularly and spends time away from the keyboard - usually watching anime, playing with her cat or reading.@karagiiKaragii says she tells herself to lock in when she encounters sexism during online gamesThe 29-year-old says the comments she receives range from the patronising, \"you're good for a girl\", to the insulting - \"get back in the kitchen\".\"I tell myself 'I need to lock in' so [I remember] I can also play well, just like everyone else,\" she tells me from her home in Surrey.\"And also, remind myself that I need to be a role model to the young women that watch me.\"Locking in at the gymThat struggle for acceptance is also something Emma felt about joining a gym - but she found a way to overcome it.She initially did workouts at home and reduced the calories in her diet, as she felt she needed to fit a certain image of a gym goer. Now Emma, 28, feels this was damaging and unnecessary.After a year of training at home, she eventually joined a gym and enjoyed the physical and mental boost of lifting weights. So much so, she began working as a personal trainer in Lancashire this year and thinks one of the best ways to lock in is setting realistic and achievable goals. @emmarose_fitnessxxEmma says teaming up with a friend for workouts can help you avoid burning out at the gymHaving a methodical plan and a clear structure can help you get started but she cautions that you can burn out by locking in too much. \"That's completely normal and I think people should be reassured that is kind of part of the process and you're not always going to feel motivated 365 days a year,\" she tells me.Emma says there are ways to help avoid burning out. These include freshening up your workout routine, trying a new fitness class, or taking part in a challenge for a short length of time - like cycling a certain number of miles in a month.\"Accountability goes a long way as well when your motivation is low,\" she adds. Partnering up with a friend for your workout can help spur you into doing them more regularly.When did locking in begin?Adam Aleksic, a linguist who posts online as Etymology Nerd, says locking in's origins aren't certain but its use appears to have begun in the early 2000s - particularly in the African American community. There's an Urban Dictionary reference dating back to 2009.But it's only in the last year that it has taken off online, whether it be a motivational video for gains in the gym or ironically in a meme about a lazy cat.\"The more a meme gets readapted and reused, the more chances it has to stick in our actual vocabulary,\" the 24-year-old explains.Despite that, locking in didn't make it onto the word of the year lists for 2025. Collins' word of the year was \"vibe coding\", while \"parasocial\" was Cambridge Dictionary's.Allow TikTok content?This article contains content provided by TikTok.

Telling a friend to lock in on what might well be a boring day often raises a smile.\"It has that element of connecting us all,\" says Dani. \"I've never actually realised, given how much we use it, that it's slang.\"After her 10-hour day in labs a fortnight ago, Dani indulged her love of art - something she does to stop burning out.\"My friend and I were painting until 4am after our exam,\" she tells me. They were locked in.More weekend picks",

Fifty patients and their immediate family members are now receiving care in surroundings that are safe and welcoming.\"In October the prince unveiled a global memorial for humanitarian aid workers where he delivered a speech on humanitarian values.This royal visit signals further intent from Prince William to establish what he has called \"more empathetic leadership around the world\" where humanitarian issues are concerned.Speaking in a recent episode of the documentary series The Reluctant Traveller,  he told presenter Eugene Levy \"change is on my agenda, change for good\".\"Not overly radical change, but change that needs to happen,\" he added.After his visit to the Gazan children, a Palace spokesperson said: \"The Prince wished to offer a moment of comfort to these young people who have endured experiences no child should ever face. \"The Prince was also able to offer his heartfelt gratitude to the NHS teams providing exceptional care during such a profoundly difficult time.\"His Royal Highness was moved by the courage shown by the children and their families and by the dedication of the team who are supporting them with such professionalism and humanity.\"Israel launched a military operation in Gaza after Hamas-led militants based in the Palestinian territory attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and abducting 251.At least 70,100 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "3 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.  Sources told BBC Ukrainian that Sea Baby drones were used in the attack - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms like Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet American officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

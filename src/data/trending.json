    "body": "Pickford on England records, World Cup dream & love of motocrossThe Football Interview is a new series in which the biggest names in sport and entertainment join host Kelly Somers for bold and in-depth conversations about the nation's favourite sport.We'll explore mindset and motivation, and talk about defining moments, career highs and personal reflections. The Football Interview brings you the person behind the player.Interviews will drop on Saturdays across BBC iPlayer, BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website. This week it will be shown on BBC One at 23:55 GMT (and after Sportscene in Scotland).———————————————————Jordan Pickford is Everton and England's number one and, fresh from signing a new contract at the Toffees, it will be something he hopes to remain for years to come.The 31-year-old started his career at his boyhood club Sunderland and had spells on loan at several lower-league clubs before making the move to Merseyside in 2017.Since then Pickford has only gone from strength to strength, making more than 300 appearances for Everton and has won their player of the year award four times, including the past three seasons.More recently, he set a new England record for consecutive clean sheets, which he extended to nine matches after the win against Latvia earlier in October.Before Monday's return to Sunderland in the Premier League, Pickford sat down with Kelly Somers to talk about his childhood, taking his son to football training and a love of motocross.Media caption, 'I'm praying I get a good reception' - Pickford awaits Stadium of Light returnKelly Somers: Let's start with football, what does it mean to you?Jordan Pickford: It is all I know really. As a young kid I played since I was five years old, so I grew up being a football fan and I had the opportunity to be a footballer which is every kid's dream. There are only so many people who can achieve that dream so it is a massive honour really and I take a lot of pride that I became a footballer.Kelly: Did you always think you would be a goalkeeper?Jordan: I was always in goal, my first memory was being in goal. I remember playing with my brother and his mates in the street and I was in the goal on the concrete. When my brother was playing for the district at the time there was a team training who needed a goalkeeper so I went in goal and that was pretty much the start of me.Kelly: A goalkeeper playing on concrete as well?Jordan: I'm daft aren't I?Kelly: Who was your childhood idol?Jordan: When I was watching football it was Kevin Phillips and Thomas Sorensen at Sunderland when I was young, but when I got older it was Wazza [Wayne Rooney] and Joe Hart.Kelly: So you always had the attacking player you liked but the goalkeeper too?Jordan: Wazza is a legend isn't he? I was a bit too young for Gazza [Paul Gascoigne].Kelly: What was it like when you first joined Sunderland, because you were a boyhood fan?Jordan: I was at Sunderland from the development squad at seven or eight and got my first contract at under-nine and then you had to do well every year to keep getting another year. Once I joined and was going to games and played every Sunday for them it was mint, but it is probably when you are a bit older at 14 or 15 that you realise you have an opportunity.Image source, @Jpickford1Image caption, Jordan Pickford started his career at SunderlandKelly: Was there ever a moment you thought, 'I could make this here?'Jordan: It starts at a younger age now but when I was growing up you used to get day release one day a week on a Tuesday, so you had the full day at training. At 14 or 15 I got invited to train on Thursday morning at Sunderland and train with the youth team, so I used to have a day and a half off school so that was when I thought that I was sticking it properly then.Kelly: You didn't have it easy all the time at Sunderland going on a lot of loans, but then you did make it here to Everton. What was that move like for you?Jordan: The loans I would say now if any goalkeeper can have an opportunity to go on loan and play in the lower leagues it will be more beneficial than youth team football. You are playing a proper game, there's a lot more pressure that you thrive off and you learn and mature more as a goalkeeper. It is probably the best thing that happened to me going on all those loans. I'll never forget when I was on loan at Preston, I was doing really well and big Sam [Allardyce] called me back and gave me a new contract and I made my debut in the FA Cup against Arsenal in the same week. A week later I made my Premier League debut, I was sat on the bench for the rest of the season but it was another good experience as well. The year after Vito Mannone got injured and that is where I grabbed the opportunity with both hands.Kelly: It feels like there's a lot of excitement around the club but there's also a lot of hype around you. You are often linked to other clubs. Why was this the right time to sign a new deal?Jordan: When I first signed we were in Europe and that was the driver then and that is where Everton should be. We had the two or three years that were a bit of a rollercoaster ride, weathered those storms and now it is all looking positive and the club is going in the right direction. You see with the signings the club has made and the drive we have this season to improve, it comes from the top of the club. I think we will see a lot more positive results and us pushing higher up the table. You want to be playing in the Premier League and I have that opportunity with Everton.Kelly: What are the ambitions of Everton this season?Jordan: I'll never look at the end of the season and say, 'I want to do this', I always take it game by game.Kelly: But when you sign a new contract you must have an idea where you want Everton to go?Jordan: We want to be pushing that top half of the table. The manager is driving us to be in the top half and try to get into Europe. I think getting into the top half and sustaining that momentum in the top half and not dropping down and keep putting us as players that pressure, to go get more results and keep improving, is definitely a drive. I think if we do that and, with the squad we have, we can push for Europe. We never know if it will be Champions League, Europa League, Conference League, but if we are in that bracket then we have had a good season.Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Jordan Pickford had several loan spells while at Sunderland before joining Everton permanently in 2017Kelly: As for England that is not going too badly too - qualifying for the World Cup and keeping nine successive clean sheets for you as well, surpassing Gordan Banks' record. What does that mean to you?Jordan: I don't take all the credit. It is a great honour to break a record like that because Banksy is an absolute legend of the game but I always say it is a team effort - we win together, lose together and keep clean sheets together. I know Harry Kane keeps scoring goals week in and week out, but the lads are there to provide service and I am there to help the lads when I am needed to make a save and be called upon, that is what I feel like I do. I am always in the moment as a goalkeeper because them games I probably have not had that much to do, but when called upon and making saves I am making the right decisions, playing out from the back. So there's a lot more to it than just clean sheets because it is not as if I am having seven or eight saves to make in a game, there's the concentration element to it. I take credit for that in terms of staying in the game and the moment but I'll never take the credit for keeping a clean sheet.Kelly: How do you stay in the moment when you are not busy?Jordan: You have to stay mentally prepared. Every goalkeeper is different. For me it will be if the ball is in the other half of the pitch I will always be on the right side, always mirroring the pitch and making sure I feel if it is breaking down I am in the right position to maybe get a through-ball or make a save. Communication as well, I feel like just being connected is key.Kelly: It has been a remarkable career for you so far and you still have a fair few years left, but when you reflect on it all has there been a turning point or a moment where you think, 'if that hadn't happened, maybe I wouldn't have achieved what I have?'Jordan: I think I have always had that mentality that I want to improve myself. I don't want to think that because I've got 80 caps for England or played 330 times for Everton that I've made it, I am always striving for more for myself. When my son Arlo was born that was a big change where there was an unknown to the family. It was new to me and Megan and that was a big change. That was when I had a bit of a dip of form and that is when I started using psychologists, rough with the smooth.Kelly: There's been some interesting quotes from your team-mates where they have talked about your personality. I've heard James Tarkowski say you bark at him and you have had arguments on the pitch. Kyle Walker has described you in various ways, Declan Rice - I've read some of the quotes - but basically they are all just saying you are a bit bonkers!Jordan: There is probably a line where sometimes I go too much that way. That is something I am trying to adapt. There has got to be a balance. When I put a football shirt on, if I am doing small-sided games with the lads in training I hate losing. It gets me right up. I think it shows the passion I have for wanting to win.Kelly: We know how your team-mates describe you, how would your best friend or family describe you?Jordan: I think they will say I am caring and that I look out for people like my mates and I always want the best for everybody. I think it is one thing I am good at.Kelly: What are you like as a football dad? Do you try to blend in or are you shouting at your boy?Jordan: If I am behind the goal, but the last few times he has switched on because I had a little discussion with him where I told him he'd enjoy football more if he was concentrating. I went to one game and he wasn't interacting and getting involved as much but he is only six. He took it so much on board and me and Meg went the next week, he was playing against Stoke's academy and it was when there was a storm and it was freezing but he was amazing. I didn't say anything to him then because he had taken it on board and it was amazing to see him enjoying it. I asked him if he was enjoying it and he said yes and I felt mint then. He played again at the weekend and he was really good again. I wouldn't shout at him, if he is lacking concentration I will just say \"switch on\".Image source, @Jpickford1Image caption, Jordan Pickford and his wife Megan have three childrenKelly: What was it like growing up in your house?Jordan: Mad. That was mad. My parents brought me and my brother up really well. They were strict but not too strict. They let us do a lot of what we wanted to do. Times have changed now, you don't see kids out on the street as much now and I feel like we've lost that way a bit. I was out on the street and my mam was shouting, 'get in Jordan, you have school tomorrow'. I wanted to be out all the time,Kelly: Were you a bit of a naughty kid, maybe?Jordan: I think so. My mam would describe me as something else!Kelly: I read a quote from you the other day that even when you get an England call-up now your mum still texts you congratulations so you are obviously very close.Jordan: I will ring her every morning and on the way home from training every day. She will text me before every call-up and text me saying good luck before every game and would text me after saying well done whether I've had a good game or a bad game.Kelly: Tell me one thing about yourself that would surprise me.Jordan: I am not allowed to do it as a footballer but I would love to be able to do motocross. I grew up going to watch it every week with my mates, and my best best mate now rides in the British Championships. If I could I would go every week to watch as much as I can. I would do it if I could but there are strict rules in our contracts where we are not allowed to do activities like that. That is probably one thing in my life I would have love to have done.Kelly: Is that a big passion of yours?Jordan: Yes as I went from such a young age and we would stay in motorhomes and caravans at the racetrack as kids and it was mint. The adrenaline I get from watching my mates on the start line and the gate drops, then get to the first corner... the adrenaline I get if they get a good start and I am properly leaning over and cheering them on.Kelly: Do you get spotted there?Jordan: Yeah I get spotted but it doesn't bother me, I am leaning over the fence to push them on to try to do better. It gives me proper adrenaline and it is one of the things I love.Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing for the rest of your career what would it be?Jordan: Win the World Cup.Kelly: Next summer?Jordan: Yep. That would do me. It is what the whole nation is waiting for.Kelly: Do you feel like you've got the best opportunity now?Jordan: Yes we've had some great opportunities. The more experiences you have in tournament football and see the lads winning cups and Champions League then you can lean on that. I think, for me, to lift that World Cup or a major trophy for England would be number one and if I could ever get silverware at Everton that would be number two. It has been that long since England has won something and to be a part of that would be amazing. We have to believe in ourselves, we have that opportunity and we have to take it with both hands but you are playing the best nations in the world and you have to play your best in each game and that's what takes you so far.Kelly: What are you proudest of?Jordan: As a young kid growing up, getting that opportunity to become a footballer, you might make your debut for Sunderland and it might become a dream but it is that sustainability for doing it for so many years and keep progressing and keep getting better that I think I am proud of myself for - and to keep putting the dedication I put in.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsA 60-day cruise around Australia has been cancelled days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind by the ship on a remote island.Suzanne Rees had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) is investigating the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner.The CEO of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said on Saturday that passengers and crew on the Coral Adventurer were told on Wednesday that the remainder of the voyage had been cancelled due to the \"tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues\".He added in a statement that passengers would be issued a full refund, and said Coral Expeditions was working \"to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights\".Amsa also released an updated statement on Saturday, saying it had \"issued a notice to the Master of Coral Adventurer\" prohibiting any new passengers from boarding the ship.The spokesperson said that officials would attend the vessel in Cairns upon its return.The ship initially left the north-western city on 24 October, and was just two days into the voyage at the time of the 80-year-old's death. Lizard Island was the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard - who typically pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise - were transported there for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said on Thursday that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Earlier this week, Mr Fifield confirmed that Coral Expeditions was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".He said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] on board just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening\", Ms Mallinson added. \"This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoAndrew HardingParis correspondent, ParisThis week's trial of three undercover operatives, accused of helping the Kremlin to wage a hybrid warfare campaign to \"destabilise\" France, sounds like a surefire recipe for drama, sophistication, and intrigue.If only.Over the course of three days, in a spacious, pine-panelled courtroom on the northern edge of Paris, the case against three seemingly unremarkable Bulgarian men, seated behind glass and shadowed by three police officers who seemed absorbed with their own mobile phones, unfolded with all the panache and excitement of a half-whispered lecture in a library.\"I had absolutely no idea where we were.\"\"I did it for the money.\"\"In the future I plan to get involved in charity work.\"These few lines from the men's testimony may help convey the general tone.All three were jailed on Friday for two to four years.But to bemoan the barely audible banality of it all – the dull motives, the mumbled attempts to shift blame, the sullen complaints about prison life and unsatisfactory psychiatric evaluations - is to miss the truth.The banality is the whole point.Like the cheap drones that both Russia and Ukraine now use to patrol their front lines, the three men on trial in courtroom 2.01 at the Palais de Justice in Paris represent a low-budget evolution of modern hybrid warfare.Improvised and startlingly effective.Rising in turn inside their glass cage, Georgi Filipov, Nikolay Ivanov and Kiril Milushev admitted carrying out the acts, but denied working for a foreign power as well as antisemitism.Early one morning in May 2024, on the banks of the River Seine in the heart of Paris, the three men conspired to spray red paint - and filmed themselves doing so - on the Wall of the Righteous, a monument to those who saved French Jews from the Holocaust during World War Two. Thirty-five red handprints were left on the Shoah memorial. Five hundred more were painted elsewhere.It was the first in a series of symbolic attacks in France: pigs' heads placed outside mosques (an act blamed on a group of Serbians); coffins left ominously by the Eiffel Tower; Stars of David painted around the capital.News of each event was swiftly broadcast around the world – not just by regular media outlets, but by the automated army of Russian social media trolls which, according to the French agency monitoring such activity, routinely seeks to weaponise each sliver of news that might raise doubts about the stability of French society, and the strength of Europe's democracies, its institutions, and its values.France is seen as a particularly tempting target for the Kremlin, given its current political and social divisions, its often ambiguous attitude to Nato, its large Muslim and Jewish populations, the increasing popularity of the far right, and a history of close ties to Moscow on both extremes of the political spectrum.In another era, the Kremlin might have used its own deep undercover agents to carry out acts of sabotage or vandalism. But – to make the drone warfare comparison again – why rely solely on valuable assets like highly trained spies, giant ballistic missiles, or submarines used to cut undersea cables, when for a few thousand euros you can, through discreet and easily deniable channels, recruit your own disaffected army of petty criminals, or unemployed wannabe fascists?\"I had absolutely no idea where we were,\" said Georgi Filipov, as he tried to play down his alleged role in the \"red hands\" operation, arguing that he had travelled from Bulgaria simply to make a little money to help with child support payments for his nine-year-old son. He was allegedly paid €1,000 (£875) plus travel expenses.In the dock, Filipov, 36, cut a gaunt but muscular figure, twitching slightly like a boxer before a fight as he attempted to defuse awkward questions about his tattoos. In particular, the swastika on his chest and the social media photos showing him giving a Nazi salute and wearing a t-shirt that claimed Hitler \"was right\".\"I made bad choices in the past,\" Filipov explained, and pointed out that he had already removed several tattoos. The Paris criminal court sentenced him to two years in jail.Having been successfully extradited from Bulgaria and Croatia to face trial in France, the men all sought to place the blame on a fourth man, Mircho Angelov, who remains at large but is alleged to have links to a Russian intelligence officer. He was given a three-year term in absentia.The second defendant, Kiril Milushev, 28, said he had only come to France because he had broken up with his partner, was struggling with a bipolar disorder, and wanted to keep his friend, Mircho, company. He was given two years.Seated beside Milushev, Nikolay Ivanov creased his forehead as he denied any links with Russia. He spoke of his grandparents' role in saving Jews during World War Two and said his ambition now was to obtain a master's degree in law, and to be reunited with his girlfriend - if she'd still have him, when all this was over.Considered the mastermind behind the plot, he was given the heaviest jail term of four years.As for Russia's alleged role in the red-hands affair, even the defence lawyers openly admitted that \"we suspect\" Moscow's hand. But they insisted, as did their clients, that they were unwitting pawns, proxies – one might even say \"drones\" – in a shadow war against the West.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentElla MurrayElla (left) with flatmate Maisy, says socialising is often done at the kitchen tableHomes without lounges are becoming a reality for renters on tight budgets faced with a lack of available lets.Nearly a third of homes advertised on flat-sharing website SpareRoom in the first half of the year had no living room.Ella Murray, aged 22, who shares with three other people in London, said: \"At this stage in my life I'm not willing to sacrifice money for more space.\"Landlords say turning a lounge into a bedroom helps them cover their higher mortgages and other extra costs, while meeting demand from tenants.But a lack of communal space means many renters are living and working in one bedroom putting them at risk of social isolation.Some also point out the \"false economy\" of being forced to go out to socialise which can cost more than a night in with friends.Cost-of-living pressuresStudents living away from home might expect to rent in a property where the front room has been converted into a bedroom.But these latest figures suggest this is a reality for young professionals renting in their 20s and 30s.Analysis by SpareRoom, shared with the BBC, shows:Some 30% of adverts for a room posted on the platform in the first half of the year were for places without a living roomThat proportion was higher in London, at 41%Birmingham saw an increase from 16% to 22% of adverts with no living room in the five years from 2020The data covers flat or house shares only, and does not include any studio, or one-bedroom listings.Official figures show average UK monthly private rents increased by 5.5%, to £1,354, in the year to September.As costs rise, there are 10 prospective tenants on average chasing every available rental property, according to the latest Rightmove data.A landlord turning a lounge into a bedroom provides an extra place for a tenant. It could also mean lower rent payments for each tenant but potentially more rent overall for landlords covering higher mortgage repayments seen in recent years.Ella and her three housemates split the rent of £3,000 a month dependant on the size of their bedrooms, but their home does not have a living room.\"We have a decent-sized kitchen with a dining table which is where we hang out instead. We would definitely socialise more if we had a living room,\" she said.She said the rent was cheaper as a result, and - living in London - it was the norm among her friends in other rental properties in the city.She works in musical theatre, and said she would be more inclined to rent somewhere with a living room were her wage to increase and were she to move in with a partner.Hannah CarneyHannah and her flatmate Emma usually socialise in the kitchenHannah Carney, 26, also shares a property without a lounge and says none of the places she had rented since she was 18 had a living room.She says she misses having a \"chill place that is social\" and it means she and her flatmates probably spend more on going out for dinner and drinks.\"I'd love to say that all properties should have a communal area. I wish that was the norm, but I know it's not realistic,\" she said.The best she and her flatmate could do, she says, is to have movie nights in a box room that they also use to hang their washing.Matt Hutchinson, director of SpareRoom said: \"We've had so many messages from people who met their best friends and partners in flatshares, who've raised families or started businesses together.\"Those kinds of stories will become rarer if communal, sociable spaces within homes are not protected. Sadly, loneliness is alarmingly common.\"With rents as unaffordable as they are now, it's understandable people are looking for ways to cut the cost of living.\"Chris Norris, chief policy officer at the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) said the \"root of the challenges\" was too few rental homes to meet demand.The NRLA said some landlords, facing a difficult outlook, were moving into offering multi-occupancy homes so their businesses remained viable enough to carry on.\"With rising costs and the expectation of smaller margins to contend with, some landlords will certainly be looking at how to use their investments most efficiently and meet demand effectively whilst delivering high-quality private rented homes,\" Mr Norris said.At the more extreme end of the scale, the BBC has previously uncovered illegal house-sharing in multi-occupancy homes.",

    "body": "15 hours agoBen Hatton & Maia DaviesGetty Images, York Cottage, Alamy, Oliver's TravelsAnmer Hall, York Cottage, Park House and Gardens House are all on the estate - but not all of them are available Newly stripped of his \"prince\" title, Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.Formal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.The historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.It was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.The estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.The main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.It remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.Andrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.Some assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.\"But no,\" he said, \"he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.\"\"This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.\"Sandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.The Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.But royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be \"as soon as possible and practicable\". Here is a look at some of the options on the estate.York CottageAlamyOriginally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.It has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.There were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.It has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.Everything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proudWhere does the King get his money?Park HouseBrendan Beirne/ShutterstockThe birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.In 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.The charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.Gardens HouseOliver's TravelsGardens House was put on the market as a holiday let over the summerAnother option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.The Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.Its grounds hold a working sawmill and organic farm.It was put on the market in July at a weekly price of £4,110. It is not unusual for royal residences to rent out property to holidaymakers - with eight cottages and lodges available for hire at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.The FollyAnother possibility is The Folly - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge built in the 1800s.Complete with a turret and a wraparound balcony, it has been used as a hunting lodge and a place to take afternoon tea.Also listed as a holiday let to the public, it is said to have room for six guests - a change from the 30-room Windsor mansion Andrew will be vacating.Given the lodge's \"grandeur\", Majesty Magazine's managing editor Joe Little told the BBC earlier this year, there is a \"a heightened awareness that the privately owned royal estates are actively striving to bolster\" the Royal Family's revenue streams.Wood FarmShutterstockThis is one option that is understood to have been ruled out.The farmhouse, described as \"small and intimate\" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, has strong associations with Andrew's parents.His father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, chose the secluded property as his permanent home when he retired from public life in 2017.He and the late Queen already regularly stayed there in preference to opening up Sandringham House when it was just the two of them.Anmer HallGetty ImagesAnmer Hall was gifted to the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales as a wedding present by the late queen in 2013 - so this may be an unlikely choice.They spend much of the school holidays in the 10-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house, which is about 2 miles (3km) east of the main Sandringham house.The Georgian property dates back to about 1802, but some parts are much older - and it has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898.",

    "body": "1 day agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesAfter weeks, months, years and even decades of scandals, all the titles and privileges of the former Prince Andrew have been completely removed. There are no modern precedents for such a colossal loss of royal status.Unlike the previous statement on his future, this was from Buckingham Palace rather than Andrew himself. It's a ripping off the bandage moment, which the Palace will hope will finally draw a line under the endless oil slick of bad news stories about Andrew.Follow live updates on this storyThe sliver of dignity given to him, that he was voluntarily choosing not to use his titles, has been taken away.Titles such as Duke of York, the Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh will be forcibly removed.All that remains is his place in the line of succession, and new guidance from the House of Commons Library has shown that too could be removed by Parliament, if Commonwealth realms give their consent.After more than a year of pressure, the so-called Siege of Royal Lodge is over, with Andrew losing his independent lease and moving to the King's estate in Sandringham. It's not revealed where exactly, but it's not Wood Farm.Sandringham is privately owned by the King, ending any reliance on a Crown Estate property.His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson is said to be making her own separate arrangements, not currently expected to be with Andrew in Norfolk.It makes Andrew dependent on the King for his home and his money. And also it has to be said, a duty of care for his brother's welfare.This announcement might head off the immediate threat of Parliament taking matters into its own hands and voting to strip Andrew of his titles. MPs had become increasingly vocal about debating the scandal and the Public Accounts Committee had been flexing its muscles over protecting public funding.But it's going to be much harder for the Palace to settle an authentic feeling of public outrage. The sense of unchecked privilege surrounding Andrew has genuinely irritated the public and it will take more than taking away his titles to dispel the sense of ugly entitlement.Polling by YouGov published on Thursday showed Andrew now has the worst ever popularity ratings for a royal, with 91% holding a negative view of him.And the King heard that unhappiness first hand from a heckler in Lichfield this week, who shouted: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\"Watch: Moment King gets heckled about Prince AndrewFor the Palace, there will be questions about why such longstanding problems around Andrew weren't dealt with before now. So much of this has been known for so many years - the unsuitable business links, the unexplained funding, the connections with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The cast list changes - alleged Chinese spies or dictators' wealthy relatives - but the story has remained the same.The unsavoury link with Epstein was being widely discussed 14 years ago when Andrew was stripped of his role as trade representative.Andrew has been losing jobs but continuing to live in a royal style for many years now and it's stretched public patience. It felt arrogant and out of touch.A few clicks on Google will find decades of stories raising doubts about his suitability, often accompanied by pictures of Andrew in a top hat, like a renegade Monopoly piece.BBC NewsnightPrince Andrew pictured during his Newsnight interview in 2019There might be some public fatigue around this Andrew story. People might feel they've heard enough and are sick of it. But there was also an angry public mood that expected a clearer sense of accountability.What remains to be seen now is whether a wider can of worms has been opened.Who knew what and when at the Palace about Andrew and Epstein? Do we need more transparency around royal property and finance? How many houses do they have up their sleeve in Windsor? And what fresh scandals about Andrew could still emerge?But this scorched earth approach to Andrew's future might also show an unexpectedly steely side to the King. While other members of the Royal Family were part of the decision, including Prince William, it's understood that it was the King who made this big call on his brother's future. Whatever the grandstanding of pundits, it can't have been an easy decision.There seemed to have been an irrevocable change of attitude when an email from Andrew to Epstein emerged, showing their continued contact. It seemed to destroy Andrew's promises in the Newsnight interview to have cut ties.It no longer seemed tenable that Andrew should have the honour of being a prince and living in some splendour among the royals in Windsor.Instead the King highlighted the victims of abuse, whose stories lie at the dark heart of Epstein's circle.It's not long since Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was grinning on the Buckingham Palace balcony, waving to the crowds. He'll wake up tomorrow morning for the first time in his life as Mr Mountbatten Windsor, private citizen.",

    "body": "'Nobody owns the sand': The 12-metre fence dividing an affluent beach town6 hours agoCurtis LancasterSouth of England, SandbanksBBCA group of Sandbanks residents are unhappy with the erecting of a fence on a local beach\"We're being denied something that should be free to us,\" is the feeling among some local residents of a seaside town that is divided over a section of beach. Resorts like Sandbanks in Poole often lay dormant in the winter months, silently waiting for summer tourist crowds to descend once again.But after a fence went up on a beach, a row erupted between residents who enjoy the area all year round.Some locals claim their right to roam has been restricted and others say they own the land and can use it however they like.As a regular beachgoer I went down to hear both sides of the argument that has split a community.Norman Allenby-Smith is the chairman of the Sandbanks Community Group'Nobody owns the sand'Sandbanks holds a special place in my heart, as the spot where I first met and proposed to my now wife.And as I stroll along the promenade on a chilly autumn morning I'm aware of the dozens of other people also meandering in their own world, each with their own special link to this place.This is why the erecting of a wooden fence on a stretch of beach earlier this year, has caused passions to run high.\"Nobody owns the sand, the sand is a natural public right of way,\" says Suzanne McGowan who has lived in Sandbanks since 1992 and has walked her dogs in the area daily.\"The boy I've got with me today first come down when he was 12 weeks old and he is now 12 and a half years old,\" she says as she looks down at her black labrador.We walk down Footpath No. 82, a stone's throw from the main beach, flanked by a yacht club on one side and housing on the other.It runs from Panorama Road down to the edge of Poole Harbour and locals have used it to access the beach and foreshore for decades.Luxury homes are fortunate enough to have rear gardens that lead right down to the sand where the fence has been put up.Now there is also a sign warning people to stay within a 1.8m-wide path on the beach, adding: \"Trespassers will be prosecuted.\"Ms McGowan said she was recently told to leave the area when her dog ventured beyond the fence, onto land which homeowners say belongs to them.She said she had not been able to return to the site since as she felt it was \"very intimidating\".Suzanne McGowan and Fanny Thomas say they have been warned off the landFanny Thomas, who is about to turn 80, says she has been walking in the area for her whole life.She said when she recently walked her dog on the beach late at night a security light came on, a CCTV camera was filming her and a voice echoed from a nearby speaker telling her to \"go away\".Sue Draper, has lived in the area since the 1980s and is \"angry\" with the situation.\"Why should we have our beach fenced off?\" she asked.Adding that residents have \"used it for all these years and nobody was bothered\".She explained that when people follow the public footpath they are now forced to congregate on one small patch of sand because there was \"nowhere to go\".Lesley Barratt, has walked there since 2002, and said the quiet area is ideal for dog walking when the main beach is busy.\"We don't sit around there we go along and then come back again,\" she said.Residents say dog walkers are forced to congregate in a small areaSandbanks tops the list as Britain's most expensive seaside location with an average house price of £965,708 in the area last year.On The Horseshoe, which is the road that backs onto the beach at the centre of the row, I am greeted by the front gates of those homes whose gardens lead to the sand.After trying each of the buzzers on the road I was unable to find the owner of the fence, however Nick Sawyer, a resident on the road did answer his intercom and shared his views.\"It is not a beach as they keep saying, it's actually a foreshore and it's privately owned,\" he said.He added: \"It's all gotten really out of hand and ridiculous.\"Mr Sawyer told me he does not mind people walking along the beach as long as they were \"courteous and respectful\". \"I'm not trying to fight anybody here, I'm just trying to find an amicable solution,\" he said.A wire fence has been put up further down the beach with private property attachedNorman Allenby-Smith, the chairman of the 650-member Sandbanks Community Group says he has also been trying to find a civilized solution but has so far \"failed\".He said the intimidation of local residents is what forced his group into action.\"We felt we had to do something about it, before then it was friendly and people didn't mind but now unfortunately it's brought it to a head,\" he said.The group are now seeking legal advice, as they fear the impact that leaving something like this could have.\"It all sets a precedent and there are other areas that could have the same sort of problem if they are not careful,\" he said.\"We've got to watch the protection of the public realm all around the peninsula.\"Who owns the shoreline?The Crown Estate (TCE) manages around half of the foreshore around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which is the land between mean high and mean low water mark.It said: \"The land in question isn't under TCE ownership and appears to be privately owned.\" A spokesperson for Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, said: \"As the land is in ownership, there is no planning application required for the fence. \"In terms of the beach, I've been informed it is a private beach by the relevant officer and have nothing further to suggest public access is possible.\"Lewis Winks, a campaigner with the national group Right to Roam is appealing for new legislation to protect public access to the countryside.He said ownership can be \"complex\" and the group wants people to have access to places where they have historically been able to roam like the foreshore \"regardless of the ownership there\".\"I think one of the issues that's being encountered is because the ownership structures are so complex and because we don't have robust statutory rights of access that we end up with these situations where people literally overnight can lose really cherished access,\" he said.More on this story",

    "body": "She's a pop star, he's a former PM - why Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau just might work7 hours agoNadine Yousif,senior Canada reporter, and Nardine Saad,in Los AngelesGetty Images / PAIt is a pairing that few could have predicted: a former Canadian prime minister and an American pop star who has toured the world and reached the edge of space.Justin Trudeau and Katy Perry have made it official. The couple were spotted holding hands in Paris last weekend as they left the Crazy Horse cabaret, where they had been celebrating Perry's 41st birthday.While they may seem an unlikely duo, Trudeau and Perry – who have both been in the spotlight for the better part of the last decade – have more in common than some might think. And their budding romance is not entirely unprecedented in Canadian political history.The pairing also allows them to change the conversation after a year in which both have faced hits to their reputations.The relationship is a \"rebranding for both of them in a very interesting and unexpected way\", says Jose Rodriguez, a professor of communication studies at California State University Long Beach.Partnering with a statesman creates a credible bridge for Perry into civic and philanthropic endeavours, he adds. It expands her audience and access to a politically engaged public, and global organisations outside the music industry.For Trudeau, 53, the California Girls singer helps his new persona because she is in \"a softer arena\", Mr Rodriguez says, rather than the tough world of politics.At the core of it is simple human connection, too, observers note. Both are newly single - Trudeau and his wife separated in 2023 - and this is the first post-split high-profile romance for both.Changing the conversationThe romance rumours between them began swirling in late July, when the two were spotted having dinner together at Le Violon, a swanky restaurant in the heart of Montreal. Two days later, Trudeau was spotted attending Perry's show in the city, singing along to her hits Firework and Teenage Dream.Then, in mid-October, images of them kissing aboard Perry's yacht off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, went viral.Neither Trudeau nor Perry have publicly spoken about their romance. Their representatives did not respond to the BBC's requests for comments. But before the weekend photos landed, the singer appeared to hint at the relationship during a London tour stop last month.A fan in the audience proposed to her shortly after photos of her and Trudeau canoodling surfaced.\"You know, you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago,\" Perry responded.Even though many may not have seen it coming, observers say their getting together helps serve their individual public images.Getty ImagesTrudeau resigned in January after nearly a decade in power due to his plummeting popularity in CanadaAfter becoming a global progressive icon when he was catapulted into Canada's highest office in 2015, Trudeau was forced to resign earlier this year after his popularity plummeted.Despite winning a sweeping majority a decade ago - promising \"sunny ways\" domestically while being admired for his youthful charm abroad - it did not take long for scandals to tarnish his image.A series of luxury vacations drew criticism for being tone-deaf - including one trip to the private island of the Aga Khan in the Bahamas, which was found to have violated federal conflict-of-interest laws. Trudeau then faced another controversy in 2019 after old photos of him in blackface surfaced, forcing him to issue a public apology.By the end of his tenure, Canadians had grown frustrated with his leadership and were ready to move on.Perry has similarly faced a crop of undesirable headlines after riding high for years.The singer was enjoying the height of pop stardom in the 2010s, churning out consistent hits, and her bold, colourful style helped define pop culture. In 2018, Billboard magazine named her one of the greatest popstars of the 21st Century. But scandal found her, too. Her newest album, 143, was panned by critics as her worst artistic effort to date. The Guardian called it \"some way short of a total catastrophe\", while the Telegraph called it \"disastrous\".And earlier this year, she was mocked for taking part in an all-woman Blue Origin space flight with billionaire Jeff Bezos' wife Lauren Sanchez and CBS anchor Gayle King. Perry acknowledged the criticism in April, saying \"I'm not perfect\" but that \"the internet is very much a dumping ground for the unhinged and unhealed\".Getty ImagesJustin Trudeau and Sophie Grégoire Trudeau announced their split after 18 years of marriage in 2023Then came the split between her and Bloom, who she was with after her marriage to comedian Russell Brand fell apart in 2011.\"When you're in the middle of an unfortunate storyline, the best thing you can do is move onto a different storyline,\" notes Los Angeles Times pop music critic Mikael Wood.The relationship with Trudeau \"changes the subject from a flop album and from a tour that seemed a little thirsty and misguided, and makes us talk about something else\".The measured roll-out of the relationship also seemed to ease observers into the romance. Prof Rodriguez notes that the optics of them appearing together in Paris was \"a high signal, low speech confirmation\" of their affection that allowed the visuals to do the work. \"Each has weathered scrutiny, so a carefully staged relationship narrative can re-index attention around vitality, optimism and cross-domain relevance.\"A match made in heaven?The pair do have things in common.Perry and Trudeau are ideologically aligned, LA-based music writer Gerrick Kennedy observes, being \"anti-establishment\" disruptors in their respective fields.Perry herself is no stranger to activism and politics, having performed at multiple campaign events in 2016 for Democratic US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. She is a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights and has supported various feminist charities and causes - issues that Trudeau had also publicly backed (he famously made gender-parity in cabinet central to his policy).They also each appear to be dedicated parents to their young children. Perry's four-year-old daughter, Daisy, features frequently on her Instagram. Trudeau's Instagram shows he spent the summer taking each of his three children on separate holidays.Getty ImagesKaty Perry recently ended a nine-year relationship with actor Orlando Bloom, with whom she shares a daughterBy dating Perry, Trudeau is charting a different path post-politics than his predecessors, who often assume high-level consulting gigs or join law firms. It is, however, on-brand for a prime minister who was always unusual, says Michael Mulvey, a marketing professor at the University of Ottawa.As the son of another former prime minister, Pierre Eliott Trudeau, he grew up in the spotlight. One of the earliest photos of him is of an infant Justin being held by former US First Lady Pat Nixon.After the separation from his wife, the youngest Trudeau could not escape the inevitable comparisons to his father, who also separated from his first wife and the mother of his children, Margaret, while in office.The senior Trudeau had his own famous flings, namely with American singer Barbra Streisand and Canadian actress Kim Cattrall, of Sex and the City fame.\"There's no question that we see history repeating itself,\" says Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa.But Prof Mulvey notes that there are others who connect with his human experience of being a newly single dad.Not long after his exit from politics, Trudeau posted a photo of himself buying kitchenware, which commentators took as him signalling the start of his \"divorced dad era\".\"There are probably some people that hope he gets it together, has a cooling off period from the post-divorce trauma and gets on with his life,\" Prof Mulvey says.

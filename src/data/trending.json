    "body": "3 hours agoPA MediaThe Liberal Democrats have called for Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) services in England to be designated as critical national infrastructure to stop vulnerable children being treated as \"cash cows\" by private investors.Council spending on SEND - support for children who need extra help because of a disability or learning difficulty - has soared in recent years, while private companies have increasingly bought up schools and services.The Lib Dems said their proposals would give the government more powers to scrutinise acquisitions of SEND providers and ensure deals are in the public interest.The government is expected to set out its plans to reform the system next week.It has already announced that there will be new national standards and price bands for independent providers. The Department for Education said this would end fee variation and give councils the confidence to challenge poor value placements.It has not set out the level of these bands but reports have suggested there could be a cap of £60,000 a year.If schools do not comply with the bands they will not be able to take on state-funded pupils.Ministers have also expressed a desire for more children to be supported within mainstream schools.Independent special schools charge an average of £63,000 per child per year, more than twice the £26,000 cost of a state special school.More than 30% of independent special schools are backed by private equity firms, according to the government.Currently the status of critical national infrastructure is reserved for essential services like energy, transport and water.Under the Lib Dem plans, SEND acquisitions would also be subject to public interest tests under the Enterprise Act. This would give the government greater powers to oversee acquisitions and mergers, with the secretary of state able to intervene if a deal threatens the public interest.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"No parent wants to see their child's education suffer while private equity firms cash in on a broken system.\"Liberal Democrats would introduce new protections to ensure taxpayers' money is spent on front-line services for children, not lining the pockets of offshore investors.\"The Department for Education has been approached for comment.Delayed government plans to overhaul the system could be unveiled as early as Monday, when MPs return to Parliament.Leaked plans suggest that from 2029 children will have their right to support reassessed after primary school and when they move from secondary school to college.As the government seeks to control rapidly rising costs, this will mean a smaller proportion of children will retain their legal entitlement to support.The proposals could face a backlash from campaign groups who fear they could water down the legal rights of children.The government has already agreed to clear £5bn worth of debts that councils have built up and take on responsibility for SEND spending from 2028.",

    "body": "1 hour agoJessica MurphyGetty ImagesDane revealed in April 2025 that he had been diagnosed with ALSEric Dane, the actor best known for his roles on Grey's Anatomy and Euphoria, has died less than a year after revealing he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 53. Dane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or 'Dr McSteamy', on medical drama Grey's Anatomy.The California-born actor was diagnosed last year with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).\"With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS,\" reads a statement from his family. He was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.The written statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, \"who were the center of his world\". \"He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he's received,\" it said. Dane also played Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley & Me, Valentine's Day and Burlesque.Getty ImagesDane first appeared in the second series of Grey's Anatomy in 2006 before returning as a main cast memberALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles. It affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, causing patients to slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk and breathe independently. \"Because, you know, my father was taken from me when I was young,\" he told the programme. \"And now, you know, there's a very good chance I'm going to be taken from my girls while they're very young\".His father died by suicide when Dane was seven years old. The actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993. Dane's Grey's Anatomy co-stars are leading tributes to the late actor.Kim Raver - who plays doctor Teddy Altman in the series - said: \"During filming he'd get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you.\" Kevin McKidd, who plays trauma surgeon Owen Hunt, posted \"rest in peace buddy\" on Instagram.Euphoria creator Sam Levinson told Variety: \"I'm heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend.\"\"Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift,\" he said.Correction 20 February 2026: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Kim Raver played Eric Dane's on-screen wife in Grey's Anatomy. Their characters had a short-lived romance but were not married.",

    "body": "8 hours agoThere is one image of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor dominates the today's front pages, marking the moment the former prince was arrested and released on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Daily Express runs the picture of Mountbatten-Windsor slouched in the back of the car while leaving police custody on Thursday evening. The paper headlines on the King's comment that \"the law must take its course\". Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Guardian also leads with the same picture and the King's comment about his brother. The front page also previews a editorial in the paper reflecting on challenges for the Royal Family going forward, remarking that the \"old model – of discreet exile and silence – seems finished\". \"Downfall\" is the one-worded headline on the front of the Daily Mail, next to a zoomed-in version of the Mountbatten-Windsor photograph. It describes the former prince as looking \"haggard, shamed and haunted\" as he was released from police custody. The Daily Telegraph reports the former prince has become the first senior member of the Royal Family in modern history to have been arrested.  \"The magnitude of his fall from grace seemed etched on his face,\" the paper says. The Times has called the arrest of Andrew the \"biggest crisis for the monarchy since the abdication\".Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"has nowhere to hide\", the Daily Mirror reports. A former royal protection chief Dai Davies called the moment \"huge\" and says that the situation \"could affect the whole monarchy\". \"Now he's sweating\" is the headline of the Sun, a reference to the 2019 BBC Newsnight interview in which he claimed to be unable to sweat due to a medical condition. The Metro's headline also focuses on the response of King Charles to his brother's arrest. The King is believed to have had no warning before the arrest, which happened on the former prince's 66th birthday. The i Paper reports that Thames Valley Police \"carried out a morning raid at his temporary farmhouse residence on the Sandringham estate\". The Daily Star also carries the zoomed in image of Mountbatten-Windsor \"looking tired\" leaving the Aylsham police station after \"11 hours in police custody\". And, the one paper not focused on the former prince, Financial Times features the latest developments from the US on Iran. President Donald Trump has set \"a 10-day window to decide on Iran strikes\" or make a deal, the paper reports. It says in recent days the US has bolstered its \"huge military force deployed to the Middle East\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment7 hours agoHelen BriggsScience correspondentGettyOver 10 million cats are kept as pets in the UKThe first detailed genetic map of cancer in pet cats reveals striking similarities with human versions of the disease, possibly helping find new ways to treat cancers in both.Scientists analysed tumour DNA from almost 500 domestic cats, uncovering key genetic mutations linked with the condition.Cancer is one of the main causes of illness and death in cats, however, very little is known about how it develops.\"Cat cancer genetics has totally been a black box up until now,\" said lead researcher, Dr Louise Van der Wayden. \"The more we can understand about cancer in any species has got to be beneficial for everybody.\"GettyUnderstanding the genetic basis of cancer in cats can lead to better treatments They found many of the genes driving cat cancers are mirrored in humans, suggesting the two species share key biological processes that allow tumours to grow and spread.The scientists say the household cat could hold the key to understanding certain types of breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer. Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples, and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment. Getty ImagesCancer is one of the leading causes of illness in catsAlmost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are. \"This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,\" said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.The research is published in the journal, Science.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterAFP via Getty ImagesEMI Records was one of the major players of the music industryWarning: this article contains offensive and derogatory languageJeffrey Epstein considered investing in music company EMI after his associate David Stern appeared to suggest it potentially offered access to women, recently released emails suggest.Epstein replied that he was interested, adding: \"Do we need help - mandelson? [sic]\"Stern and Lord Mandelson did not reply to requests for comment.Many of his emails to Epstein flagged potential deals, and in February 2010 he forwarded a short news article about the financial woes of EMI at the time. EMI is a now-defunct conglomerate that included EMI Records, formerly one of the major players of the music industry. It was acquired by Universal Music in 2012.\"Troubled industry but related to P,\" Stern wrote to Epstein.\"P\", which Epstein apparently used to refer to women, is believed to be an abbreviation of the word \"pussy\", another term Epstein often used.For birthdays and New Year greetings, Stern wished Epstein \"lots of P\", according to the recently released files. He once offered to get Epstein fashion show tickets \"to review Chinese P\". He would send Epstein a \"P factor\" for the places he visited, giving the Spanish island Ibiza 9/10, and Sarah Ferguson's 50th birthday party 0.2/10.The emails have been newly released by the US Department of JusticeAt the time Epstein had considered asking Stern for his help in an EMI investment, Lord Mandelson was First Secretary of State and Business Secretary in the UK government.Stern said it was \"too early to get Mandelson involved before i know more\".Epstein appears to have emailed Lord Mandelson a few days later, saying: \"please email me bens contact info.. or havehim cal me re emi. [sic]\"In reply, Lord Mandelson appears to say: \"Gave to [redacted]. Email is [redacted]. Talk re EMI ??\".It's not clear exactly who \"ben\" is.Epstein sent another reply to Stern, suggesting that if the deal went ahead, he would put US businessman and former Sony Music company CEO Tommy Mottola in charge of it.He wrote, \"my friend is tommy mottola former head of sony I'd like him to be brought in to fix it\".Mottola did not reply to a request for comment. US Department of JusticeAn image from the Epstein files showing David Stern at the opening of a new office for his company Asia Gateway in Beijing in 2011Epstein's proposed deal did not go ahead – and EMI's main lender Citigroup ended up taking control of the company.However later on, in 2011, Epstein's circle were still discussing a bid for EMI.Kevin Law, a businessmen in the US state of Connecticut who was often in touch with Epstein, apparently wrote: \"Tell your buddy Andrew from the UK if he's interested in EMI as we discussed I can put him in the syndicate w KKR.\" It is not clear if Epstein's \"buddy\" referred to here is Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.PA MediaDavid Stern sits to the left of the Queen at a Pitch@Palace event at St James's Palace in London, in November 2016Law has said he \"never bid on EMI with any group nor did I ever do a business deal with Epstein,\" and said he did not know the former prince.The giant private equity firm KKR declined to comment. At the time KKR had a controlling stake in a rival record company, BMG.Stern was apparently still keen on acquiring a record company in 2011. He wrote: \"EMI may now come up for sale. Could actually be of interest to Chinese if structured properly. Also, most certainly great asset to have for P!\"However Epstein did not buy it then either.In November 2011, Citigroup split EMI into two parts and, the following year, sold it to Universal and a consortium involving Sony and record executive David Geffen.The DOJ files show other discussions between Epstein and associates about buying model agencies and fashion-related businesses, which also did not go ahead.French prosecutors have previously suspected that Epstein used his contact in the fashion industry, Jean-Luc Brunel, to house and transport young girls.More on this story",

    "body": "25 minutes agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: Obama gave \"classified information\" with alien comments, says TrumpUS President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to \"begin the process of identifying and releasing\" government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life. Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said \"aliens are real\" on a podcast last week. \"He's not supposed to be doing that,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: \"He made a big mistake.\"Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: \"Well, I don't know if they're real or not.\"Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday. \"They're real, but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in Area 51,\" Obama said. \"There's no underground facility unless there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.\"After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe. In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: \"I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!\" Obama's initial comments were made during a quickfire \"lightning\" round of questions on the podcast.There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and \"doesn't have an opinion on it\". Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that \"based on the tremendous interest shown\" he will seek the release of files \"related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters\".The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a secret Pentagon programme to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.In 2022, Congress held the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter - setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.The following year, a US House of Representatives panel on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the Pentagon said there was \"no evidence\" that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoBethany BellBBC Vienna correspondentBergrettung KalsAn Austrian climber has been found guilty of gross negligent manslaughter after his girlfriend froze to death on Austria's highest mountain last year.The man, named only as Thomas P in line with Austrian privacy laws, has been given a five-month suspended sentence and fined €9,600 (£8,400).His girlfriend, Kerstin G, died of hypothermia during a climbing trip on the Grossglockner mountain in January 2025.In a statement sent to the BBC, the court said it considered Thomas P's previous clean record and the loss of a person close to him \"to be mitigating factors\". It said it also took into account \"the public discussion on social media, which was incriminating for the defendant\".The judge, Norbert Hofer, himself an experienced climber who works with mountain and helicopter rescue teams in Tyrol, said Thomas P was an excellent Alpinist, but that his girlfriend was light-years behind him in terms of her climbing abilities.He said the couple should have turned back as Kerstin G did not have enough experience in winter conditions.The court also heard from Andrea B, a former girlfriend of Thomas P, who described how he had left her alone on a previous tour on the Grossglockner in 2023. She said she had been at the end of her tether, feeling dizzy and her headlight had gone out. She said she was crying and screaming when he suddenly disappeared, walking ahead and leaving her behind.Grossglockner mountain in AustriaAccording to reports in the Austrian media, the court heard how the mountain rescue team found Kerstin's body hanging upside down from a rock face.\"We were amazed that she remained in that position,\" one of the rescuers told the court. If the wind had been any stronger, \"she would have fallen over the south face\".The prosecution said there were strong winds of up to 74 km/h (45 mph), and was very cold. It was -8C, with a windchill temperature of -20C, they said.They argued that as the more experienced climber, Thomas P was \"the responsible guide for the tour\". They said he failed to turn back or call for help in time to help his girlfriend.Thomas P should never have allowed himself to get into this situation, the prosecutor said.Thomas P pleaded not guilty. He told the court he was deeply sorry. He said he had loved his girlfriend, who was very sporty and that they had planned the trip together.His lawyer Kurt Jelinek said the couple had found themselves in a really difficult and stressful situation.He said Kerstin was not inexperienced and knew what she was getting into.www.foto-webcam.euThis still from webcam footage shows the couple still climbing at 21:00 on 18 JanuaryProsecutors say the couple got stuck on the mountain and that the man failed to call the police and did not send any distress signals when a police helicopter flew overhead at around 22:30.Video footage from the helicopter showed the couple still climbing. The judge noted that no distress signals were sent.The defence argued that at that point Thomas P and girlfriend still felt fine and did not call for help as they were close to the summit.Webcam images show lights from their torches as they scaled the mountain.But shortly afterwards, the defence said the situation changed dramatically, when Kerstin became exhausted close to the summit.The defence said that she told Thomas P to go to get help.At 00:35 on 19 January, he called the mountain police. The content of the conversation is disputed. Rescuers said it wasn't an emergency call but the lawyer says he denies telling police that everything was fine.He scaled the summit and descended on the other side, leaving Kerstin behind. Prosecutors say he left her at 02:00 am.Webcam images show his torchlit figure coming down from the summit.The trial sparked interest and debate, not just in Austria but in mountain climbing communities far beyond its borders, raising questions about when personal judgement and risk-taking become a matter of criminal liability.The case is subject to appeal.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Spring is just around the cornerByDarren BettLead Weather PresenterA major change in the UK's weather pattern is heading our way.The brief spell of cold weather with frost, ice and hill snow is ending, with temperatures set to jump by up to 10C from Friday onwards.The blocked weather pattern which has been maintaining the recent wintry spell is being pushed away with milder air sticking around for the next week or so.It will be accompanied by further spells of wet weather coming across from the Atlantic. Heaviest rain is expected to be over western hills and the ongoing threat of flooding is likely to continue.How warm will it get?Image caption, Maximum temperatures this weekend will be higher than the average for mid FebruaryRecent days have seen temperatures typically 4C or 5C (39-41F) by day and as low as minus 9C (16F) in Scotland at night. It also felt colder in the strong south-easterly wind.The cold air is being pushed away to the east of the UK and a change to south-westerly winds will bring much milder air from the Atlantic. Daytime temperatures will be 10-14 Celsius (50-57F) in many parts of the country over the weekend and into next week. The risk of frost is much reduced with temperatures at night generally falling to 5-9 Celsius (41-48F).There has been a stark lack of mild days in Scotland this year, with the start of 2026 marking the longest wait for the temperature to reach 12C (54F) in the country since 1986.Why such a significant change?Image caption, Jet stream further north allowing south-westerly winds to lift temperaturesThe cold blocking area of high pressure over Scandinavia that has been in place for much of 2026 so far is being pushed away. That means milder winds can push across the whole of northern Europe more consistently. The jet stream, which has been positioned across the UK for the last few weeks will move further north at times, keeping the UK in warmer air. Risk of flooding to continueImage source, BBCWeatherWatchers/s PaceImage caption, Flooding in Datchet. A large number of flood warnings are in southern EnglandThe persistence of the rain has led to the flooding many parts of the UK have experienced. Parts of Cornwall have had rain falling on each of the last 50 days. Katesbridge in Northern Ireland and Aboyne in Scotland have already had half a years rainfall in just a few weeks.Image caption, Wettest places in each home nation with rainfall totals all well above averageThe predominantly south-westerly winds over the next few weeks will bring in spells of rain and areas of low pressure from time to time. The wettest weather is expected to be over western hills. That means a change of fortune in Scotland, where up to now it has been extremely wet in eastern Scotland but drier than normal in the west of the country.The recent snowfall will also melt rapidly as temperatures rise.Given saturated ground in many parts of the UK and flood warnings, mainly in England, the risk of flooding will remain a concern well in to March.You can find the longer range forecast here.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoFaarea MasudGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves has come under criticism for her public borrowing rulesThe government's finances had a record monthly surplus in January as it took in more tax receipts than it spent.The surplus - the difference between public spending and the tax take - was £30.4bn in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The ONS said it was the highest surplus in any month since records began in 1993, and nearly double last January's £15.4bn monthly surplus.Analysts had expected the surplus to be £23.8bn. The government usually collects more tax than it spends in January compared with other months due to the collection of self-assessed taxes, but higher levels of capital gains tax payments to HMRC pushed the figure to a record.Borrowing in the 10 months to January was £112.1bn - 11.5% lower than the same 10 month period a year ago - although the ONS noted that it was the fifth-highest borrowing for the period on record.HM Treasury said borrowing for 2026 is forecast to be \"the lowest since before the pandemic.\"Chief Secretary to the Treasury, James Murray said: \"We know there is more to do to stop one in every £10 the government spends going on debt interest, and we will more than halve borrowing by 2030-31 so that money can be spent on policing, schools and the NHS.\"Separately, retail sales grew more than expected in January, according to official data.The amount of goods bought rose by 1.8% in January, up from 0.4% in December, the ONS reported.City economists had expected a rise of 0.2%. The performance was boosted by strong demand for sports supplements and jewellery. Sales of artwork and antiques also did well.\"The big reduction in public borrowing and surge in retail sales in January support other evidence that the economy started the year looking a lot healthier,\" said Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics. He said it will give Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"something positive to point to\" in her Spring Statement on 3 March.Dales added that Reeves' freeze on income tax thresholds took in an additional £3.6bn from a year ago, and a  \"£17bn surge\" in capital gains tax receipts in January also buoyed the public finances.The Treasury's freeze on income tax thresholds is dragging people in to paying higher tax rates as their incomes rise.Another thing that helped the government's finances was that it spent less on interest payments on its debt, the ONS said - which offset higher costs on public service and benefits.Taking a look at the whole year, Dales cautioned that the \"that borrowing has failed to come down much\", and that much of the success in retail sales came from transient boosts such as sports supplements - which would fall back as people fell off the new year health kick.He suggested part of the boost in retail spending was not sustainable, especially as recent figures showed that wage growth had slowed, and unemployment had reached its highest in five years.",

    "body": "12 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentPA MediaTwo addresses are being searched following the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorWhen Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.What led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.It was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.One email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip. There were further email revelations from the files. A month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.These will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen. In order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would \"support\" Thames Valley Police.Detectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.So far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surfaceIt is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew's part.The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date. Now detectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks. Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King's brother.If they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman's terms, the King against the King's brother.

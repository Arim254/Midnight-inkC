The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "4 hours agoTom Bennett,LondonandBernd Debusmann Jr,White HouseReutersThe UK has named career diplomat Christian Turner as its new ambassador to the US, Downing Street has confirmed.The previous ambassador, Peter Mandelson, was sacked by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer after evidence, including emails and photos, emerged showing his continued association with the paedophile Jeffery Epstein.Turner has spent nearly 30 years working across Whitehall and the Foreign Office.As the new ambassador in Washington, he will have to navigate relations with the Trump administration, which have been partly strained by disagreements over how to handle the war in Ukraine, as well as President Donald Trump's criticism of Europe.The Foreign Office said in a statement that King Charles had formally appointed Turner, and the UK would now seek official approval - or agrément - for his appointment from the US.Turner said he was \"honoured\" to be nominated for the position. \"At a pivotal time for the transatlantic relationship, I look forward to working with President Trump's administration, and leaders in Congress, business and society to strengthen that bond in the years ahead,\" he said. Turner will face a heavy load of diplomatic tasks when he takes up the role.Chiefly among them is working with the US on Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, which European nations fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution.Earlier this month, a US national security strategy document - signed by Trump - argued that Europe was facing \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether certain European countries could remain reliable allies.Turner will also have to work to secure a long-anticipated but delayed tech deal with the US, amid concerns from some White House and congressional officials who have been critical of the UK's online safety laws. Some have characterised those regulations as \"censorship\" and legal overreach that impacts US firms.AFP via Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson (right) announced US-UK trade agreement alongside Donald Trump in May Starmer's government has pushed for close ties with Trump, hosting him on a second state visit in September, during which Trump praised the \"unbreakable bond\" between the US and UK.But just days before Trump arrived, Starmer sacked Mandelson after revelations over his friendship to Epstein. Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.The Foreign Office reportedly pushed hard for a diplomatically experienced figure to be appointed as the new ambassador. Turner's previous roles include political director at the Foreign Office, British High Commissioner to Pakistan, and Foreign Office Director for the Middle East and North Africa. He also previously worked in 10 Downing Street as private secretary to the prime minister.Before entering government, he worked in television documentaries.In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Starmer said: \"The United Kingdom and United States have a very special relationship, and Christian's extensive experience as an outstanding diplomat will support this uniquely close bond and ensure it continues to flourish.\"Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said Turner would bring \"exceptional diplomatic experience and deep understanding\" to the role. Ambassador to the US is seen as one of the UK's top diplomatic postings. More on this story",

    "body": "Just nowThe Minister for Women and Equalities, Bridget Phillipson, is blocking the publication of trans guidance that would require businesses and public bodies to protect women-only spaces, describing them as \"trans-exclusive\", according to the Daily Telegraph. The paper also focuses on Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch's criticism of the government's plan to tackle misogyny in schools, saying it must look at immigration from cultures that \"don't respect women\". And the Prince and Princess of Wales' outdoor family Christmas photo with their three children takes the top picture spot undre the caption \"Fresh heir\". A photo of actress Olivia Coleman at the launch of Labour's strategy to stop violence against women and girls is splashed across the Metro's front page. The government has revealed a raft of new measures aimed at cracking down on the \"national emergency\" and change men's behaviours towards women.The Independent follows with their lead on the government's vow to make women and girls \"safe at last\". The paper also focuses on a call from Under-Secretary of State for Safeguarding and Violence Against Women and Girls Jess Phillips for \"all of society to step up and end the epidemic of abuse and violence that shames or country\". Elsewhere, a smiling Rory McIlroy lifts the trophy for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.The i Paper is predicts a \"mortgage price war in spring\" after the Bank of England cut interest rates to 3.75%, the lowest since 2023. Mortgage brokers are hoping for a \"golden era of house buying\" early in the new year as the central bank expects inflation to fall quicker than expected, the paper says.The signs of cooling inflation also makes the Financial Times' lead story. Elsewhere, there are fears of financial reprisals by Russia among some EU states if a move to agree to a multi-billion euro loan in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs goes ahead. According to the paper, last year Western businesses held at least $127bn of assets in Russia.Staying with Russia, the Daily Express features comments by Badenoch, who says the Tories are the only party to have the \"competence\" to deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats. The Conservative leader added that the UK could not afford complacency and must \"face down\" Russia, the paper reports.In news closer to home, nearly 10 million voters face having their local elections delayed until 2027 as part of Labour's plans to reorganise local government, the Times reports. The paper says the government has asked more than 60 districts and county councils if they want to suspend elections due to take place in May next year.\"Labour's running scared of voters\" is the Daily Mail's take. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has likened the move to the actions of a \"dictator\" the paper says.The Guardian turns its attention to the new photos from late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate released by US House Democrats. Among the new batch of images are what appear to be lines from the novel Lolita written on different parts of a woman's body, the paper says. As Christmas nears, around 1.8 million people will spend the day alone, says the Daily Mirror. The results from a poll have prompted pleas from ministers for people to \"pop in on a pal\" and look out for their lonely neighbours.The Sun reports that former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the broadcaster rigged voting to kick him off the show. A BBC spokesperson said: \"Strictly Come Dancing's public vote is robust and independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy.\"Finally, the Daily Star pays tribute to darts ace Ally Pally's \"lucky wasp\", which was sadly swatted and killed after it landed on PDC World Championship winner David Munyua's face. \"Rest sting peace\" is the headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "26 minutes agoPeter Hoskins,Business reporterandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentTikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance has signed binding agreements with US and global investors to sell the majority of its  business in America, TikTok's boss told employees on Thursday.Half of the joint venture will be owned by a group of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake and the Emirati investment firm MGX, according to a memo sent by chief executive Shou Zi Chew.The deal, which is set to close on 22 January, would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns.The deal is ​line with one unveiled in September, when US President Donald Trump delayed the enforcement of a law that would ban the app unless it was sold.In the memo, TikTok said the deal will enable \"over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community\".Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will hold 15% each.Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, according to the memo.The White House previously said that Oracle, which was co-founded by Trump supporter Larry Ellison, will licence TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal.The deal comes after a long delay. In April 2024, during President Joe Biden's administration, the US Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns, unless it was sold.The law was set to go into effect on 20 January 2025 but was pushed back multiple times by Trump, while his administration worked out a deal to transfer ownership.Trump said in September that he had spoken on the phone to China's President Xi Jinping, who he said had given the deal the go ahead.The White House referred the BBC to TikTok when contacted for comment.Oracle declined to comment.",

    "body": "5 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinHouse Oversight CommitteeThe House Oversight Committee has released a batch of around 70 photos from the estate of late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It's the third such release from a tranche of over 95,000 photos the committee has acquired from Epstein's estate. It includes images of quotes from the book Lolita written across a woman's body, and redacted images of women's foreign passports. It comes hours before the 19 December deadline for the Department of Justice to release all files related to its investigation into Epstein. \"These new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession,\" said ranking member of the committee, Robert Garcia.What's in the images releasedSome of the photos released on Thursday show Epstein speaking with professor and activist Noam Chomsky aboard a private plane; Bill Gates standing beside a woman whose face is redacted; Steve Bannon sitting at a desk across from Epstein, and former Alphabet president Sergey Brin at a dinner event. The BBC has attempted to contact each for comment.These are the latest wealthy, powerful men to be seen in Epstein estate photos released by the House Oversight Committee - previously released photos also show US President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, as well as film director Woody Allen, former US treasury secretary Larry Summers, attorney Alan Dershowitz, former prince Andrew Mountbatton-Windsor, and others. Appearing in the photos is not evidence of any wrongdoing, and many of the pictured men have said they were never involved in Epstein's illegal activity. House Oversight CommitteeIn a statement accompanying the photo release, Democrats on the US House Oversight Committee said the Epstein estate did not provide context or timings for the pictures. \"Photos were selected to provide the public with transparency into a representative sample of the photos received from the estate, and to provide insights into Epstein's network and his extremely disturbing activities,\" the statement says.The release also includes several photos of quotes from the Vladimir Nabokov novel Lolita written in black ink across different parts of a woman's body, like her chest, foot, hipbone, and back. Lolita tells the story of a young girl who was groomed by a middle-aged literature professor.One quote from the book written across a woman's chest reads, \"Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth\". House Oversight CommitteeThere are also a number of photos of female passports and identification documents from countries around the world, including Lithuania, Russia, the Czech Republic, and Ukraine.  Most of the information on the documents, like names and birth dates, is redacted but the House Oversight Committee said in a press release that the passports belong to \"women whom Jeffrey Epstein and his conspirators were engaging\".Another photo shows Epstein sitting at a desk closely surrounded by three female figures whose faces have been redacted - one has her hand on Epstein's chest under his shirt, and another is crouching to look at a nearby laptop. Epstein appears to be helping the third put on a bracelet. House Oversight CommitteeAnother image released is a screenshot of text messages from an unknown person who says they have been sent \"some girls\" and are asking for \"$1000 per girl\". House Oversight CommitteePhoto release comes ahead of DOJ deadlineThe committee has thousands of images in its possession from the Epstein estate, which are \"both graphic and mundane\", its statement on Thursday explained. The House Oversight Committee first subpoenaed the estate of Epstein, who died in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations of sex trafficking, in August. The photos and files the Epstein estate gave to the committee are separate from what is largely referred to as \"the Epstein files\". Those are documents within the justice department's possession related to its own investigation into Epstein. Under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Trump signed into law last month, the DOJ has until 19 December to release its files. The extent of what's contained in the DOJ's files is unknown, and it's likely that much of the content will be heavily redacted, similar to House Oversight Committee materials. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoNadine YousifandMax MatzaPolice have issued an arrest warrant for the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two people and injured nine others, sources close to the investigation told the BBC's US partner, CBS News.Authorities are now searching for the person and a car the suspect is believed to have rented, according to CBS. They have not publicly identified the suspect.They also are looking into a possible link between the shooting at Brown and the killing of a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology two days later.The search is now in its sixth day, with investigators knocking on doors, asking for home-security videos, and appealing to the public for tips to find the gunman.A news conference that police in Providence, Rhode Island, had planned for Thursday afternoon was abruptly cancelled, but they said they expected to give an update later in the day.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources that they are investigating possible connections between the shooting and the killing of an Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) nuclear science and engineering professor two days later. Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, was shot \"multiple times\" on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources told CBS. The sources said a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes. Federal authorities had previously said there was no link between the two murders.On Wednesday, authorities released a photo of an individual they believe was in close proximity to their primary person of interest.Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, \"who may have information relevant to the investigation\".The chief also said the killer \"could be anywhere\", adding that \"we don't know where the person is or who he is\".A day earlier, police had shown footage of a person of interest where a man was seen walking around the university campus with a black mask over his mouth, possibly \"casing\" the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration that the mass shooting investigation has appeared to yield little progress so far. In response, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught \"and it is just a matter of time before we catch him\".The FBI has offered a $50,000 (£37,350) reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University's Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman student. ",

    "body": "1 hour agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesMillions of people will be able to set their own contactless card payment limits or even have no limit at all, a regulator has confirmed.Banks and card providers will be given the power, from March, to set a maximum - or unlimited - single payment amount without the need to enter a four-digit PIN.But they are also being encouraged by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to allow cardholders to set their own individual limits, or switch off contactless entirely. Some banks already offer this function.The move comes despite the FCA's own survey showing little appetite among consumers and industry respondents for a change from the current £100 limit on contactless cards.The FCA said it did not expect card providers to make immediate changes to the current limit from March, but they had the flexibility to do so.When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021.While contactless cards currently have a £100 payment limit, anyone using their smartphone to pay can spend any amount without the need for a PIN.In-built security features, such as thumbprints and face ID, provide greater protection.But concerns have been raised about cards becoming more attractive to thieves and fraudsters, when high-value payments can be made with a tap of a card.Various protections are already in place, such as a prompt to enter a PIN after a series of consecutive contactless transactions are made.Consumers would still get their money back if it was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA.\"Contactless is people's favoured way to pay. We want to make sure our rules provide flexibility for the future, and choice for both firms and consumers,\" he said.Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand allow industry to set contactless card limits.Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments and innovation at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: \"Any changes made in the future will be done carefully and ensure strong security and fraud controls remain in place.\"Temptation to spend?The FCA's own survey on changing the rules, released during consultation, showed that 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the current limits.Consumers and academics have suggested that the extra convenience of unlimited contactless payment limits could also lead to shoppers spending without thinking.This is said to be a particular issue with credit cards, when people are spending borrowed money and accumulating debt.Financial abuse charities have also warned that unlimited contactless spending could give abusers free access to drain a survivor's bank account with no checks or alerts.They also worry it could also hasten the shift towards a cashless society, despite notes and coins being a lifeline to many financial abuse survivors whose card transactions are monitored online by their abusers.One policy to help vulnerable customers access cash, as bank branches close, is the development of shared banking hubs.Cash Access UK, the organisation set up to protect access to cash across the UK, announced the official opening of its 200th banking hub in Billericay, Essex, on Friday.

    "body": "Wiz Khalifa sentenced to nine months jail in Romania for smoking cannabis on stage5 hours agoMircea Barbu,BucharestandAndré Rhoden-PaulGetty ImagesA Romanian court has sentenced Wiz Khalifa to nine months in prison for smoking cannabis on stage.The American rapper, real name Thomaz Cameron Jibril, admitted to smoking a joint during his performance at the Beach, Please! festival last year in Costinesti.A Romanian appeals court overturned an earlier fine of 3,600 Romanian lei (£619; $829) for drug possession and ruled the rapper must serve the sentence in custody. However he was sentenced in abstentia, and it is unclear if Jibril is even in Romania - he was last seen on Tuesday, performing with Gunna in California.The BBC has approached the ten-time Grammy-nominated artist for comment. Police briefly held and questioned Jibril after the concert on 13 July 2024, and prosecutors later charged him with possession of \"risk drugs\" for personal use.  Romanian investigators said he was in possession of more than 18 grams of cannabis and consumed an additional amount on stage. In a written decision, the Constanța Court of Appeal judges said they overturned the original fine because the artist had sent \"a message of normalisation of illegal conduct\" and thereby encouraged \"drug use among young people\".Calling it an \"ostentatious act\", the judges said the rapper was \"a music performer, on the stage of a music festival well known among young people\" who \"possessed and consumed, in front of a large audience predominantly made up of very young people, an artisanal cigarette\".Jabril said in a post on X a day after the incident that he did not mean to offend the country. \"They [the authorities] were very respectful and let me go. I'll be back soon. But without a big ass joint next time.\" Romanian criminologist Vlad Zaha told BBC News that there was little-to-no chance of the US extraditing Jibril, and described the sentence as \"unusually harsh\". \"Given the defendant's wealth and connections, Romania's lack of real negotiating power on extradition, and the legal and political status of cannabis in the US, it is highly unlikely that Wiz Khalifa will be sent to serve a prison sentence in Constanța, even though a formal judicial request will be submitted to the United States,\" Mr Zaha said. The  artist, known for songs like Black and Yellow, See You Again and Young, Wild & Free, is often pictured smoking on his social media and founded his own marijuana brand in 2016. Cannabis is legal recreational and medical use in some US states, but remains illegal under federal law.",

Improvement works taking place over the Christmas period mean several routes will be closed or restricted.Information on what routes will be closed for repairs can be found on the Network Rail website.National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.Daniel Mann, Director of Industry Operations at the Rail Delivery Group, said: \"We encourage customers to reserve seats where possible, bring only luggage that is easy to carry and fits in designated storage areas, and allow extra time for their journeys.\"FlightsFriday is expected to be the busiest day of the festive season for airports, but the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said flying on Christmas Day was becoming more popular.It advised customers to know their rights in case their flight is cancelled or delayed.If this happens, airlines are required to support passengers. This can include:Providing food and drink during extended delaysCovering accommodation if passengers are delayed overnightOffering a refund or alternative travel if a flight is cancelledIf your flight is cancelled, and it is covered by UK law, your airline must let you choose between either getting a refund or being booked on to an alternative flight.You can check if your flight is covered under UK law here.The CAA also said that travellers can minimise their risk of delays by ensuring their cases are packed correctly.This includes leaving presents unwrapped as they may need to be inspected.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe UK government says it will ban so-called \"nudification\" apps as part of efforts to tackle misogyny online.New laws - announced on Thursday as part of a wider strategy to halve violence against women and girls - will make it illegal to create and supply AI tools letting users edit images to seemingly remove someone's clothing.The new offences would build on existing rules around sexually explicit deepfakes and intimate image abuse, the government said.\"Women and girls deserve to be safe online as well as offline,\" said Technology Secretary Liz Kendall.\"We will not stand by while technology is weaponised to abuse, humiliate and exploit them through the creation of non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes.\"Creating deepfake explicit images of someone without their consent is already a criminal offence under the Online Safety Act.Ms Kendall said the new offence - which makes it illegal to create or distribute nudifying apps - would mean \"those who profit from them or enable their use will feel the full force of the law\".Nudification or \"de-clothing\" apps use generative AI to realistically make it look like a person has been stripped of their clothing in an image or video.Experts have issued warnings about the rise of such apps and the potential for fake nude imagery to inflict serious harm on victims - particularly when used to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM).In April, the Children's Commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza called for a total ban on nudification apps.\"The act of making such an image is rightly illegal – the technology enabling it should also be,\" she said in a report.The government said on Thursday it would \"join forces with tech companies\" to develop methods to combat intimate image abuse.This would include continuing its work with UK safety tech firm SafeToNet, it said.The UK company developed AI software it claimed could identify and block sexual content, as well as block cameras when they detect sexual content is being captured.Such tech builds on existing filters implemented by platforms such as Meta to detect and flag potential nudity in imagery, often with the aim of stopping children taking or sharing intimate images of themselves.'No reason to exist'Plans to ban nudifying apps come after previous calls from child protection charities for the government to crack down on the tech.The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) - whose Report Remove helpline allows under-18s to confidentially report explicit images of themselves online - said 19% of confirmed reporters had said some or all of their imagery had been manipulated.Its chief executive Kerry Smith welcomed the measures.\"We are also glad to see concrete steps to ban these so-called nudification apps which have no reason to exist as a product,\" she said.\"Apps like this put real children at even greater risk of harm, and we see the imagery produced being harvested in some of the darkest corners of the internet.\"However while children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news, its director of strategy Dr Maria Neophytou said it was \"disappointed\" to not see similar \"ambition\" to introduce mandatory device-level protections.The charity is among organisations calling on the government to make tech firms find easier ways to identify and prevent spread of CSAM on their services, such as in private messages.The government said on Thursday it would make it \"impossible\" for children to take, share or view a nude image on their phones. It is also seeking to outlaw AI tools designed to create or distribute CSAM.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAlison HoltSocial affairs editorGetty Images via 24/7StudioJames MelleySenior Social Affair ProducerWaiting times for adult gender clinics are \"unacceptably long\" with patients waiting an average of five years and seven months for a first appointment, according to a review of services.Dr David Levy, a cancer specialist and former medical director, visited all nine gender clinics in England as part of his inquiry.He said services for adults seeking gender care were \"falling down\" with long waits, inconsistent assessments caused by a lack of shared policies across the clinics, and a lack of data about the results of the care people received.His report, published by NHS England, said unless improvements were made some patients would end up waiting 15 years for a first appointment.The nine Gender Dysphoria Clinics (GDCs) offer ongoing assessments and treatment for adults who are distressed about a mismatch between their biological sex and the gender they identify with. They can provide medication to patients, including hormones, but they do not carry out surgery.Dr Levy described the waiting times for patients to be seen at these clinics as \"shocking\" and said the \"distress some patients experience\" is often \"exacerbated by unclear waiting times and a lack of communication\".He found that the number of referrals to the clinics had more than doubled from 4,331 in 2021/22 to 9,985 in 2024/25, with around 40,000 people waiting for a first appointment by March 2025.However, the review said it was impossible to get an accurate picture of the numbers waiting as each clinic had its own list, and some people would have been referred to more than one service, either by themselves or by GPs.The clinics reported that \"there have been significant changes\" in the age of people referred to them. Previously patients tended to be older, but the \"majority of referrals are now 18 to 25 years old\".The review said the clinics found \"the new, younger cohort of patients has a higher proportion of additional neurodevelopmental conditions\", such as autism spectrum disorder and a range of other conditions, including mental health issues and trauma and abuse during childhood.The review said about a quarter of referrals were for 17 to 19 years-olds. Some had transferred from children's services, including many who had \"aged out\" because long waits meant they would not be seen before their 18th birthday.Criticism of the Tavistock clinic, which used to run the only children's gender services in England, led to its closure in 2023. A number of new multi-disciplinary children's gender clinics are being set up.The changes followed recommendations made by the Cass review into children's gender care.  Its final report, published in April 2024, also called for a review of adult gender services. Dr Levy who began his review in July 2024, described carrying it out as a \"minefield you have to walk through,\" but said the clinics had been \"very good\" and that they \"talked about this as an improvement journey.\"\"This is about getting things better for the patients, getting things better for the staff,\" he said.The report found a wide variation in services across the country and said while more money had been put in to help them recruit extra staff, that was not always reflected in an increase in the workforce.It also said some clinics did \"little or no improvement work or knowledge-sharing\".Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting welcomed the report, and said that further services would be commissioned, self-referrals would be stopped and existing services would be improved.Trans rights organisation, TransActual, welcomed recommendations \"for a more streamlined, patient-centred care pathway\", but raised concerns about ending self-referrals and said requiring a first assessment to be done by a senior clinician \"risks unnecessarily hampering efforts to reduce waiting times\".Translucent, a transgender advocacy group, said the report makes clear that \"trans healthcare is in crisis\" and called for more trained trans-people to be involved in designing and running gender care services.Sex Matters, a gender critical human rights organisation, said the review failed to consider whether the treatments offered by the clinics were effective. CEO Maya Forstater said: \"It is a wasted opportunity to rethink a failed treatment model.\"Dr Levy will now chair a new national improvement programme for adult gender services, starting in 2026.",

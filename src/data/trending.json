    "body": "13 minutes agoKate Whannel,Political reporterandNick Eardley and Harry Farley,Political correspondentsRachel Reeves has urged Labour MPs to unite behind her Budget as she vowed to stay on as chancellor in the years ahead.Speaking to a meeting of Labour's Parliamentary Party on Monday evening, Reeves warned MPs they must \"stick together\" if they wanted to win the next election. The Budget, which is expected to contain tax rises, will be delivered on Wednesday following weeks of speculation.Reeves said she thought Labour MPs would like 90-95% of her spending plan but warned they would have to accept the tougher measures as well saying: \"It's a package, not a pick-and-mix. You can't say you like the cola bottles but you don't like the fruit salad.\"\"It all comes together and hangs together as a whole.\"She said her three priorities would be: \"Cutting the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and cutting the cost of debt.\"Following the meeting, one Labour MP said the chancellor had been \"strong and honest\" but another said her pleas for unity had sounded \"desperate\". In the year since the last Budget, Labour MPs have become increasingly critical of Reeves' judgement.The Chancellor has been forced to make U-turns on some policies, including cutting the winter fuel payment.There had also been concerns in the party about suggestions she would use this Budget to raise income tax rates, a move that would have broken the party's election manifesto promise. The government now appears to have stepped back from that proposal. ",

    "body": "Two climbers have died after falling from New Zealand's highest peak on Aoraki, or  Mount Cook, which is known for its brutal terrain.They were in a group of four that was trying to climb the 3,724m-high summit. The other two were uninjured and rescued by helicopter early on Tuesday, after contacting emergency services the previous night. Hours later they found the bodies of the dead climbers, still connected by the climbing harness. But authorities are working to recover them \"in a challenging alpine environment\".Hikes to the top of Mount Cook, which towers over the Southern Alps running the length of the South Island, are difficult even for experienced climbers because of large crevasses and unpredictable weather.None of the climbers have been publicly identified, but New Zealand media outlet Stuff reported that one of those killed was a well-known,  internationally recognised mountain guide.Nearly a year ago three climbers from the US and Canada disappeared on the mountain. They were eventually declared dead after a multi-day search even though their bodies were never found - authorities say the search was hampered by bad weather.Dozens of people have died trying to make it to the summit of Mount Cook. Hardly a climbing season goes by without at least one fatality, according to the New Zealand alpine club ClimbNZ. ",

    "body": "Are we going to have a white Christmas this year?Image source, Getty ImagesBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter As the nights draw in and festive lights are getting strung up, some of us might start to hope - or dream - of seeing some Christmas snowfall.Christmas cards often depict scenes blanketed in snow. While this is a rare sight in much of the UK, a 'white Christmas' is more common than you might think.The definition of a white Christmas means that more than half of all Christmas Days in the UK have seen snow falling somewhere.So, although the odds are technically stacked in favour of a white Christmas, the detailed festive forecast for this year won't be confirmed for a while yet. At this early stage, what do we actually know about the chances of this Christmas being 'white'?For a Christmas to be officially considered 'white', the snow doesn't need to be 'deep and crisp and even.'In fact, just a single snowflake has to be recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 observing stations.The definition has changed over the years and has been broadened to include data from automated weather-recording stations as well as manned or manual sites.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day may make things look merry and bright, but it does not count under the official definition of a white Christmas.When will we know for sure that we'll have a white Christmas?Image caption, In December 2010, the UK experienced very low temperatures and significant snowfalls. Lying snow was reported in many places on Christmas Day It's still too early to know for sure. The festive forecast will become much clearer about five days before Christmas, so keep an eye on the BBC Weather app or website for the latest updates. You can also read our thoughts further ahead in our monthly outlook.Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult because, as an island nation, it is most frequently influenced by mild Atlantic weather patterns.However, longer-range weather forecasting models are beginning to show possible trends for the Christmas period, influenced by wider teleconnections - large-scale interactions in which weather patterns in distant regions create atmospheric waves and flows that affect conditions thousands of miles away.One such potential influence to our winter weather is a 'warm blob' in the Pacific Ocean which could favour higher pressure and colder conditions developing in Europe.Meteorologists are also keeping an eye on the development of a potential La Niña event over the coming months - the colder phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Whilst the link between La Niña and UK weather isn't clear cut, the Met Office suggests that historically it promotes high pressure to develop in the Atlantic in early winter.  This could mean a higher than average chance of colder weather to start December.Overall most computer models are hinting at a trend towards slightly calmer and colder conditions developing towards 25 December, so perhaps there's a chance of seeing something white on the big day! When was the last white Christmas in the UK?The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations, and very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.Since 2020, every year except 2024 has officially been a white Christmas. However, in each of these years, very few places reported any snow actually settling on the ground.What are the \"white Christmas\" odds?The chances of festive snowfall vary a lot in different locations, with much better odds the further north and the higher up you venture. The places most likely to get a white Christmas Day are northern and eastern Scotland, northern England, north Wales and the north-west Midlands.Image caption, Christmas Eve snow is now less likely in much of Europe, some parts of the UK have seen an upward trend in recent yearsAs our climate warms, winters in the UK are becoming milder and wetter. A rise in land and sea temperatures has generally reduced the chances of a white Christmas, especially when compared to the 18th and 19th centuries. ",

    "body": "The controversial, US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) says it is winding down its aid operations in the Palestinian territory, after almost six months.The organisation had already suspended its three food distribution sites in Gaza after the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel took effect six weeks ago.The GHF aimed to bypass the UN as the main supplier of aid to Gaza's population. UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.",

    "body": "Judge dismisses cases against ex-FBI director Comey and NY attorney general James11 hours agoAna FaguyComey: \"Donald Trump will probably come after me again\"A US judge has dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling that the prosecutor who brought the charges was unlawfully appointed.Judge Cameron Currie said that Lindsey Halligan, who was handpicked by Trump to bring the charges against two of his political adversaries, was never eligible to assume the post.Both Comey and James have maintained their innocence and described the prosecutions as political in nature. In response to the ruling, the White House told the BBC:  \"The facts of the indictments against Comey and James have not changed and this will not be the final word on this matter.\"President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Comey and James, declaring in one social media post, \"They're all guilty as hell\", and later adding \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\" In her decision on Monday, Judge Currie wrote that Halligan, a former White House aide who had never prosecuted a case before, was not authorised to present the charges to the grand jury.\"All actions flowing from Ms Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr Comey's indictment, were unlawful exercises of executive power and are hereby set aside,\" Currie ruled.Getty ImagesLindsey HalliganHalligan was named as a replacement for Erik Siebert, an interim US attorney who resigned in September amid the Trump administration's pressure to file charges against both Comey and James.Judge Currie determined that Halligan's appointment violated the statute governing interim US attorneys. Under that law, the attorney general has 120 days to make an interim appointment - a period that began on 21 January with Siebert's designation, the judge noted.When that 120-day window closed on 21 May, the attorney general's authority to appoint an interim replacement expired as well, Judge Currie wrote. As a result, Halligan \"has been unlawfully serving in that role\" since her 22 September appointment.The cases were dismissed \"without prejudice\", meaning the justice department could potentially refile the case at a later date.The department did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the justice department would appeal against the dismissal of Comey and James's cases \"very soon\".She said the administration's position was that Halligan had been legally appointed. Leavitt also accused the judge of \"trying to shield\"  Comey and James.Getty ImagesLetitia JamesAfter the ruling, Comey said he was grateful a prosecution \"based on malevolence and incompetence\" had ended, but noted \"Trump will probably come after me again\".Comey was fired by Trump during his first term, after leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The former FBI director was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice in September, after Trump called for his prosecution and appointed a new federal prosecutor to pursue the case. James issued a statement saying she was \"heartened by today's victory\".\"I remain fearless in the face of these baseless charges as I continue fighting for New Yorkers every single day,\" the statement continued.James was facing federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. She previously brought charges against Trump before he won re-election, and later became a target of the Trump administration.

    "body": "2 hours agoJessica UreBBC London InvestigationsBBCLouise Gates, manager at the Phoenix Garden, says she often finds phones thrown over the fenceVolunteers at a community garden in central London have been reuniting phone theft victims with their stolen devices after finding them buried in flower beds.The Phoenix Garden, which sits off Shaftesbury Avenue in Covent Garden, has seen snatchers attempt to stash stolen phones in the grounds due to its close proximity to the West End.Garden volunteers said they collected the phones from bushes and flowerbeds and handed them to their owners or the police. As a result, fewer devices have been unearthed in recent weeks.Louise Gates, Phoenix Garden manager, said she often found phones \"thrown over the fence from the night before\" when she unlocked the garden in the morning.\"Some of our volunteers have dug up phones wrapped in tin foil,\" Ms Gates added.Tin foil is often used by phone snatchers to stop the device's location being detected. It is believed that snatchers, often on electric bikes around hotspot areas like Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, have been temporarily stashing the phones in the garden for collection at a later date.Ms Gates said some of the theft victims had arrived at the garden after tracking their device's signal through Apple's Find My app.Ms Gates said the volunteers returned the phones to their owners or handed them to the policeMs Gates said if she could find the emergency contact information on the phone, she called the number provided.\"They're all really so grateful, which is nice,\" she said.\"Other times I charge it up, but nobody rings, I don't know who it belongs to or I can't find them on social media, so I just take it to the police station\".Ron Chenery, a volunteer of two years, said finding phones was a regular occurrence.\"Most of us love the garden so much, we're constantly out in the fresh air. If we see something we hand it in,\" he said. Ron Chenery said volunteers regularly found phones stashed in the gardenCommunity worker Elliot Hughes, who helps local students access the garden and get into nature, said it was important to teach young people about the wider risks of phone theft across the capital.\"The best we can do is give awareness\" he said. \"There's young people now, walking around central London on their phones, in the middle of the street, which are essentially £1,000 computers. \"So [I am] just highlighting to them maybe the things they shouldn't be doing\".A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said local officers had stepped up patrols in the area to identify potential phone snatching offenders. \"By intensifying our efforts we're catching more perpetrators and protecting people from having their phone stolen in the capital and have reduced theft by 16% since April.\"We're also dismantling organised crime groups suspected of large-scale phone theft.\"The force called on phone companies including Apple and Samsung for security improvements that would make stolen phones harder to sell.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "UK's Indo-Pacific Minister Seema Malhotra has defended her government's immigration proposals during a visit to India, while expressing concern about a rise in foreign students seeking asylum at the end of their studies.Under the new plans, some migrants could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently in the UK and the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years.The proposals will apply to an estimated 2.6 million people who arrived in the country since 2021. They have drawn criticism from some quarters, including a few Labour MPs, even though the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.The reforms are \"in line with what countries around the world do\" to stop the abuse of their immigration systems, Malhotra told the BBC in the southern Indian city of Chennai, adding that there was a \"very strong message we also send, which is that we welcome those coming legally\".According to Malhotra some16,000 international students from across the world had applied for asylum in the UK last year after completing their courses, which she said was evidence of abuse of legal migration routes.A further 14,800 students sought asylum this year to June 2025, latest Home Office figures show. It is unclear how many of them are Indian nationals.\"We've seen visa abuse in the case of legal routes, where people have gone legally and then sought to overstay when their visas weren't extended,\" Malhotra said.\"If you see that level of abuse, it undermines your immigration system. It undermines public confidence, and the fairness and control people expect.\"India remains one of the UK's biggest sources of international students, but demand is cooling. The number of Indian students heading to the UK has fallen 11% from last year as tougher immigration rules kick in. This has triggered concern among UK universities which rely on foreign students and are already under financial strain.According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, India was the top country of origin for foreign students in the UK in 2023-2024, making up 25% of arrivals. China followed at 23% while Nigeria made up 8%.Malhotra said while Britain still \"very much welcomes\" Indian students, her government was working with universities to ensure they are genuine foreign students. She said the recently concluded free trade agreement (FTA) between the UK and India had also encouraged UK universities to open local campuses in India, with Liverpool University announcing it will open a campus in Bengaluru city in 2026 last week.The FTA, signed in July after years of negotiations, is forecast to boost the UK's GDP by £4.8bn annually and expand bilateral trade between the two countries by £25.5bn.As part of the education chapter in the deal, nine UK universities have been cleared to set up campuses across India.However, these wider trade ambitions face a domestic political climate that has hardened around migration. During a visit to India in October, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would not relax visa rules for Indian nationals despite Delhi's long-standing push for easier mobility in return for trade concessions.Malhotra rejected the idea that Britain wants deeper trade while shutting the door to Indian professionals, citing the nearly half-a-million visas granted to Indian nationals last year across work, study and visitor categories.The UK is moving towards a \"contribution-based\" immigration system, where settlement and long-term stay depend on a person's economic contribution rather than the length of time they have lived in the country, Malhotra said.The government's proposal to overhaul the UK's immigration system is part of a broader attempt to show firmer control over borders, but has drawn criticism from some Labour MPs and members of the House of Lords, particularly over their potential impact on international recruitment in sectors like healthcare and social care.While the reforms are still under consultation, Malhotra, when asked about settlement routes for migrant professionals like nurses and care workers said, \"we are expanding routes for those with skills in areas that the UK requires\". A survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had warned that up to 50,000 nurses could leave the UK if the government went ahead with its immigration proposals.The report notes that the UK now has more than 200,000 internationally educated nursing staff, making up around 25% of the country's total nursing workforce of 794,000.A significant number of these nurses and care workers are from India. Several investigations, including by the BBC, have shown that many of them have fallen prey to cross-border visa scams and lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.But Malhotra said the UK was ramping up efforts to protect people from such exploitation and working with law enforcement agencies of countries like India to share intelligence and crack down on such gangs.

    "body": "Farage says he's 'never directly racially abused anybody' after school racism claims11 hours agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandDavid Deans,Wales political reporterReform UK leader Nigel Farage has insisted he has \"never directly racially abused anybody\", following complaints from 20 people he went to school with.A Guardian investigation spoke to contemporaries at Dulwich College who alleged Farage made racist and antisemitic remarks to them, which a spokesperson denied.Speaking directly to a journalist about the allegations for the first time, Farage, 61, was pressed on what he meant by \"directly\" and replied: \"By taking it out on an individual on the basis of who they are or what they are.\"He also ruled out holding an investigation into his own party, following the jailing of former Welsh Reform UK leader Nathan Gill for taking pro-Russian bribes. Among the allegations in the Guardian are that Farage joked about gas chambers and put another pupil in detention, when he was a prefect, for the colour of their skin.When asked about the claims, Farage responded: \"Have I said things 50 years ago that you could interpret as being banter in a playground, that you can interpret in the modern light of day in some sort of way? Yes.\"He added: \"I've never directly racially abused anybody. No.\"Pointing towards \"political disagreements\" with some of his school peers, Farage also denied having \"ever been part of an extremist organisation or engaged in direct, unpleasant personal abuse, genuine abuse, on that basis\".  Pressed on whether he would say categorically that he did not racially abuse fellow pupils, Farage said: \" I would never, ever do it in a hurtful or insulting way.\"Asked whether he had perhaps said things to fellow pupils that he had not intended to be hurtful or racist, but they took it that way, he said: \"I hope not.\"And asked whether he had said things at school that people might have taken offence to, he replied: \"Without any shadow of a doubt. \"And without any shadow of a doubt I shall say things tonight on this stage that some people will take offence to and will use pejorative terms about. \"That is actually in some ways what open free speech is. Sometimes you say things that people don't like.\" When asked if he would apologise to the people claiming he had been racist towards them, Farage replied: \"No, I'm not, because I don't think I did anything that directly hurt anybody.\"Farage, who was an MEP from 1999 until 2020, and was UKIP leader from 2006 to 2009 and 2010 to 2016, was also questioned about his former UKIP MEP colleague Nathan Gill, who was jailed for ten and a half years last Friday after admitting taking bribes to make pro-Russian interviews and statements when he was an MEP. Gill was first elected to Brussels as a UKIP MEP in 2014, becoming a Brexit Party MEP in 2019, sticking with the party when it became Reform UK, and becoming Welsh leader in 2021, although he failed to get re-elected shortly afterwards.Speaking at a Reform UK rally in Llandudno, north Wales, Farage said Gill was \"briefly… leader of Reform Wales\".The fact Gill took bribes \"is of course an absolute and total disgrace,\" he said. \"We disown his actions and we disown what he has done in every single way.\"In a separate interview, Farage was asked if he needed to investigate any other Russian links within his party, but said: \"I'm not a police force, I haven't got the resources.\"He added he thought there should be a broader investigation into Russian and Chinese interference in British politics, suggesting MI5 should conduct it.Farage said he was as confident \"as I can be\" that no one else in Reform past or present had done similar things to the former Reform Wales leader, labelling the issue a \"very minor embarrassment for Reform\".He said: \"I'm very shocked about Gill – he was in UKIP for a very, very long time – albeit it his time in Reform was very, very short...\"I've had no engagement with him and nobody in my leadership team has had any engagement with him whatsoever.\"Asked if that meant he could not rule out that there might be people in the party that might have spoken to him since his arrest, he added: \"Nobody in authority.\"Responding to the accusations of racism during Farage's schooldays, Liberal Democrat President-Elect Josh Babarinde MP said: \"The Reform leader's refusal to deny that he's said these racist remarks is unbecoming from someone who wants to be our next prime minister.\"The British people deserve a straight answer.\"It looks like the mask has slipped and fact-of-the matter-Farage is turning into no-answers-Nigel.\"And Labour accused Nigel Farage of claiming \"you can racially abuse people without it being hurtful and insulting\".Lord Mike Katz, a Labour peer and former Chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, called on Farage to \"come clean\" about the claims and said \"failure to do so would be yet more evidence that Farage is simply unfit for office\".He said: \"Just when you thought Nigel Farage couldn't sink any lower, he is trying to say abhorrent racist comments, including vile antisemitic insults, doesn't matter. \"He seems to think that you can racially abuse people without it being hurtful and insulting. Let's be crystal clear: you can't.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "2 hours agoSara GirvinIreland correspondentBritish Heart FoundationAdam's wife Hannah was awoken by Polly's bark, to discover her husband breathing strangelyA four-year-old golden retriever from County Fermanagh will be honoured as a \"CPR hero\" in London on Tuesday.Polly's owners Adam and Hannah Cooke, from Ballinamallard, are convinced she helped save Adam's life after he suffered a cardiac arrest in his sleep last year.A bark from Polly raised the alarm and woke Hannah who found Adam breathing strangely, before he stopped breathing completely.She then performed CPR until an ambulance arrived, saving his life.Hannah, who works in social services, said it had been a \"normal night\" before she was woken up by Polly barking just before 01:00 GMT.The 33-year-old said she initially thought Adam had been choking but he then stopped breathing.  \"I used to be a carer and I've been with people at the end of their life so I know what that end of life breathing is like,\" she said.\"If anyone has heard it, you'll never hear anything like it.\"British Heart FoundationAdam nominated his wife, and his dog, in the annual Heart Hero awards, organised by the British Heart Foundation.Hannah added: \"But he was also really, really fighting to come back. But I did think that was it, that he was never going to come back.\"Paramedics shocked Adam with a defibrillator seven times on the journey from his home to hospital.He woke up in hospital six days later.A keen runner, Adam was just 37 years old at the time of his cardiac arrest. He was later diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and was fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) – a device that can deliver an electrical shock to correct heart rhythms.After weeks of recovery in hospital, Adam and Polly were reunited.An 'emotional' reunion\"Polly is a part of the family, so I just wasn't shocked when I heard she had such a big role to play,\" he said.\"I'm not going to shy away from it, I cried, I was in tears, I think she was too.\"She was whimpering because I think she was thinking, 'Wow, you're back home. I didn't think you'd be back here'.\"It was an emotional moment\".Hannah said: \"With a cardiac arrest, everything I've learned since, it all happens in seconds, and Polly gave me those seconds.\"Polly is so in tune with Adam. After she barked, she was silent. I would say Polly knew before it was even happening. I would say Adam had just started the arrest as she barked.\"I love her to bits. She is the best dog in the world. Neither of us did anything special, but we did it together.\"Adam nominated his wife, and his dog, in the annual Heart Hero awards, organised by the British Heart Foundation.Polly wasn't able to travel to London for the event, and had her CPR medal presented to her at her favourite walking spot.Fearghal McKinney from the British Heart Foundation said he hoped the Cooke's story would encourage other people to learn CPR.\"In the UK every year there are 40,000 out of hospital cardiac arrests - fewer than one in ten will survive,\" he said. \"For every minute that passes after a cardiac arrest the chances of survival decrease by up to 10 per cent, that's a vital window, so more people having confidence to intervene will save lives.\"Adam said he owes his life to his wife and his dog.\"They are heroes. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them.\"Louise GlazebrookDog behaviourist Louise Glazebrook says owners can underestimate what their pets are capable of.Dog behaviourist and trainer, Louise Glazebrook, said said dog owners can underestimate what their pets are capable of.\"Dogs are constantly picking up signals from us that we as humans either don't understand or we don't see them do it.\"Dogs have something like 220 million scent receptors and we have around five million which is why we are breeding and creating programmes for dogs to do incredible things in disease detection.\"But obviously this is incredible that Polly managed to save a life and change the trajectory of that life forever.\"So how is Polly handling all the attention?\"She loves attention, she always has since day one,\" Adam said.\"In her mind she's number one. Even though we have a son, and another child on the way.\"Hannah added that Polly rules the house. ",

    "body": "The head of the culture select committee has questioned whether the BBC board is in \"safe hands\" under its chair Samir Shah, describing his evidence to MPs on Monday as \"wishy-washy\".Shah appeared in front of the Commons committee after a turbulent period for the BBC, which has seen its director general and head of news resign after claims about impartiality in its reporting. Speaking to the BBC's World Tonight after the hearing, Dame Caroline Dinenage, the most senior MP on the committee, said she was concerned about a lack of \"grip at the heart of BBC governance\".Shah told the Commons committee he would not walk away from the job, saying he would \"steady the ship\" and \"fix it\". Shah and other senior BBC figures were summoned to give evidence about how the corporation is addressing concerns raised about impartiality in its news coverage.The row was triggered by the leak of a memo written by an ex-independent advisor on editorial standards, which included criticism of how a Donald Trump speech was edited by the Panorama programme. The fallout has seen two of the BBC's most senior leaders quit, the US president threaten to sue and renewed pressure on the organisation from senior politicians in the UK.Asked about the assurances Shah gave to the committee, Conservative MP Dame Caroline said: \"He didn't really have direct answers on the questions of how to get the BBC to act quicker, act more decisively... we were really looking for hard evidence that the BBC board are going to grip this... I'm not entirely convinced that they can and they will.\"Asked about Shah's position, she said: \"The BBC can't be left without a [director general] and without a chair - someone needs to be there to lead the march to replace the leadership.\"But equally I don't think we as a committee were wildly enthused that the board is in safe hands.\"She continued: \"We're going to need to see a lot more robust answers to questions like the ones we were posing today... everything was very wishy-washy... there wasn't a huge sense that there was grip at the heart of the BBC governance.\"Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Ofcom head Dame Melanie Dawes said the BBC had \"serious issues recently with editorial decision making\".\"The board has a lot to do to set that right,\" the broadcasting regulator chief said.Shah told the committee the search for a new director general had begun, and that he wanted to create a deputy role because the job was \"too big for one person\".He also told the committee the BBC had been too slow to respond to controversy over how Trump's speech from 6 January 2021 had been edited.In that speech, Trump said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The BBC apologised for the edit after the leaked memo triggered public scrutiny and criticism from the White House more than a year after it had first been broadcast. The corporation later said it had given \"the mistaken impression [Trump] had made a direct call for violent action\", but Shah said on Monday that it had taken too long to do so due to an internal dispute over the wording and nature of the apology.He told the committee: \"It took time to get it right, what the actual apology was for.\"While the BBC has apologised for the edit, it has strongly rejected Trump's position that he has cause to sue the corporation for defamation, and said it would not pay financial compensation, which the president's lawyers had demanded.The leaked memo was authored by Michael Prescott, who previously acted as an external advisor to the BBC on editorial matters. He claimed there had been \"systemic\" failings over a range of topics, including claims of bias in how BBC Arabic had covered the Israel-Gaza conflict, and in the BBC's coverage of trans issues.Giving evidence to the same committee, Prescott said he believed issues were \"getting worse\" at the BBC, and that the board was \"not taking stuff as seriously as I hoped\" - though added that he did not believe the organisation to be \"institutionally biased\". Monday's hearing also took evidence from other senior figures connected to the BBC. Their evidence included: Board member Sir Robbie Gibb, a former BBC editor and ex-communications director for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, rejected claims he had orchestrated a politically motivated coup against the director general and head of news as \"complete nonsense\"Caroline Thomson told MPs that BBC News had argued the Trump edit was \"justified\" but was not \"transparent enough\", while the board felt it was \"misleading\"Caroline Daniel, another former external editorial advisor, said there had been \"robust debate\" on some issues within the BBC, and described the leaked memo as Prescott's \"personal account\"In an email to staff on Monday, Shah said recruiting a new director general, the most senior position in the BBC, to replace Tim Davie would be a \"top priority\" for him in the coming months.He said work was under way to assess whether action taken in response to issues raised in the leaked memo was \"appropriate\" or whether \"further action is required\".Shah also said a review would be carried out into how the BBC's Editorial Guidelines and Standards Committee operates, in order to ensure it has the necessary powers, represents a \"broad range of voices\", and is accountable. Both Davie and head of news Deborah Turness, who quit within hours of each other in an unprecedented shake-up at the top of the BBC, rejected there was systemic bias in the corporation's reporting.

    "body": "Five key moments after MPs question top BBC figures11 hours agoLauren TurnerCulture reporterVuk Valcic/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesFive senior BBC figures, including its chairman, faced questions from MPs for more than three hours after a leaked memo raised claims of bias at the corporation. It comes after BBC director general Tim Davie and BBC News chief Deborah Turness resigned earlier this month over a Panorama episode that edited together parts of a 2021 speech by US President Donald Trump.That edit was highlighted in the memo, which was leaked and published by the Daily Telegraph. The memo's author Michael Prescott was among those facing MPs' questions on Monday.Prescott appeared alongside Caroline Daniel, his fellow former external editorial adviser to the BBC, at the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee. BBC chairman Samir Shah and fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson also appeared.'Real work needs to be done at the BBC'Prescott, a former Sunday Times political editor, was clear when asked if he thought there was institutional bias at the BBC.\"No, I don't,\" he told MPs. \"Let's be clear, tons of stuff the BBC does is world class.\" But he said there were problems with dealing with editorial issues, adding that \"the BBC was not, and I hope they will change, treating these as having systemic causes\". \"There's real work that needs to be done at the BBC,\" he added.Prescott said he wrote the memo \"because I am a strong supporter of the BBC\". But he stressed there were \"incipient problems\" not being tackled. In other words, issues at an early stage he felt were not being dealt with.He singled out a now-removed BBC Verify story from 2024 that incorrectly reported that people from ethnic minorities paid higher car insurance premiums. This story was found to be \"utterly untrue\", Prescott said, saying this was a \"dreadful thing to have put out\". There were \"multiple levels\" of editorial failure on this story, he added, as well as the apparent absence of an inquiry into what happened and why.We were too slow to apologise, says Shah Shah started his evidence to the committee by apologising to all those who believe in the BBC, licence fee payers, and to BBC staff, saying: \"I regret the mistakes that have been made.\"This comes after he made an apology to the committee - and after the BBC also made an apology to Trump.Shah admitted action should have been taken sooner after issues with the Trump speech edit became known at board level.Former Newsnight journalist David Grossman, who wrote internal reports commissioned by the BBC board, first flagged the edit in January and it was then discussed further in May, the committee heard.\"Looking back, I think we should have made the decision [to respond] earlier, in May,\" said Shah.He told the committee that Turness, the BBC News chief, had wanted to apologise for the edit sooner, but he did not think this was \"sufficient\" as the real issue was the impression given that Trump \"encouraged a call to violent action\".\"I think there is an issue about how quickly we respond, the speed of our response, why do we not do it quickly enough,\" he said, adding: \"We should have pursued it to the end and got to the bottom of it, and not wait as we did until it became public discourse.\"Asked if there was pressure from the board to delay the apology, he said \"absolutely not\". Shah vowed to stay in his role to fix the problems.Difference of opinion over apologyThomson, who worked at the BBC until 2012 and returned this year as a non-executive board member, also spoke about the timing of the BBC apology. She said there was a \"continuing and sharp difference of opinion\" between members of the board and Turness about whether they were going to apologise for the edit or the impact of the edit. Thomson told the committee she thought the edit gave a \"misleading\" impression of what the US president said.She added that news bosses continued to maintain the impression given was correct because of the content of Trump's speech that day, saying: \"They felt that the edit was justified, but it should have been a more transparent edit.\" Sir Robbie told the committee it came down to whether \"there was a serious error\". He said he felt that the edit gave the impression that Trump's comments were a call to arms, adding this \"was a breach of editorial policy\".Chairman urged director general not to resignAsked if he tried to stop Davie stepping down, Shah said \"I did indeed\". He described the actions of Turness as \"honourable\" and \"proper\", repeating her assertion that the \"buck stops\" with her. But on Davie, he said: \"I wish, and the board wishes, that the director general had not resigned. He had our full confidence throughout.\" \"I am very sorry to lose him,\" he added. House of CommonsBBC chairman Samir Shah said he urged Tim Davie not to resignShah also told the committee the role of director general is \"too big for one person\" and that he is \"inclined to restructure the executive in the future, once we get a new director\". The BBC officially launched its search for a new boss on Monday, with the advert for the next director general now on its careers site.\"The lens through which we examine potential candidates for the director general includes the idea that there will be a deputy director general, who would be focused on journalism,\" Shah told the MPs.Sir Robbie Gibb claims he was 'weaponised'Sir Robbie, who spent over 20 years working at the BBC and was director of communications for former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, was asked how he managed his own bias. \"I have impartiality through my bones,\" he told the committee, saying it was \"drummed\" into him when he joined the BBC in 1991.He said he felt he had become \"weaponised\" in the way he had been perceived. Asked about Sir Robbie during the session, Shah said he had \"absolute faith\" in him. Sir Robbie also dismissed claims of there having been a \"board-level orchestrated coup\" over the leaking of the memo as \"complete nonsense\".\"It's also deeply offensive to fellow board members who are people of great standing in different fields,\" he added.

    "body": "8 hours agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic CorrespondentandKayleen Devlin,BBC VerifyBBCOn 26 January, staff in an office in Mumbai received an urgent e-mail from a crew member aboard a tanker off the coast of Singapore.The email, purportedly written on behalf of five colleagues aboard the tanker sailing under the name Beeta, contained a litany of complaints: crew members, it was alleged, had not been paid and were being treated \"like animals\"; and provisions were running low.The staff in Mumbai worked for the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), the world's leading organisation representing seafarers, and were used to dealing with complaints from all corners of the globe.But what caught their eye was the fact that the emails hadn't just been copied to multiple ITF offices, but also to sanctions enforcement bodies in several countries.\"The vessel is sanctioned and blacklisted,\" the sailor wrote.He said he had discovered that the vessel calling itself the Beeta was in fact an American-sanctioned tanker called the Gale.The sailor and his colleagues were desperate to leave.\"I've been at sea for many years,\" he told the BBC when we contacted him. \"I know what's right and wrong.\"Inadvertently, the crew member had found himself involved in a problem at the heart of some of today's most contentious geopolitical issues: a surging number of tankers, transporting Russian and Iranian oil, operating outside maritime rules, using a variety of methods to conceal their identities.This \"shadow fleet\", as it's known, is growing fast.ITFThis image shows the American sanctioned tanker called the GaleEstimates vary, but the latest data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com says the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.That's about 18-19% of the total internationally trading tanker fleet, carrying approximately 17% of all seaborne crude, says Michelle Wiese Bockman, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI.The phenomenon that first emerged in the 2010s, as North Korea and Iran sought to evade international sanctions, has proliferated, leaving western governments scrambling to keep up.So what can those governments do when countries circumvent or flout the rules to export oil and use the profits to fuel engines of war or repression?'Modern-day slavery'Definitions vary - as do names: it's also been called the \"dark\" or \"ghost\" fleet - but shadow vessels generally exhibit some or all of a particular set of characteristics.They tend to be old, averaging an age of around 20 years, and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed. Insurance is below Western standards and sometimes fake.Vessels frequently switch off or manipulate their automatic identification system (AIS), making them harder to track.Seamen, recruited on contracts that typically last six to nine months, don't always know what they're getting into.\"I didn't understand what shadow fleet vessels actually were,\" Russian engineer Denis told us, after serving aboard an EU- and UK-sanctioned tanker, Serena, for several months last year.Serena is currently flying under the flag of Cameroon. While Denis was aboard, it was flying a false Gambian flag.Denis says he realised the Serena was under sanctions only when he went aboard. But like many seamen, he says he needed the work.\"Once they're at sea, they've got them prisoner on board,\" says Nathan Smith, an ITF inspector familiar with the Serena.Smith has heard numerous stories of abuses aboard shadow vessels.\"It's a modern-day slavery,\" he says.Over the course of months spent sailing between Russia and China, the reality of life aboard a shadow vessel became increasingly apparent to Denis.\"Things began to deteriorate very quickly because no spare parts were sent,\" he said. \"The radar on the bridge hadn't been working for over a year, the life-saving equipment wasn't working and there were numerous faulty fire sensors.\"During a stop at the Russian port of Vladivostok, last October, the crew tried, without success, to repair a davit, a small specialised crane used to lower the tanker's life boats into the water. Denis says a port official nevertheless issued a certificate of successful inspection. The BBC has approached the Port of Vladivostok for comment.Denis says he never found out who owned the Serena or who crew members could contact to raise complaints.It's notoriously difficult to establish ownership of shadow fleet vessels. Ships have registered owners, which are often shell companies or entities set up to manage a single vessel. The names of real, or \"beneficial\" owners are frequently hidden. We have tried to make contact with the owners of the Gale and Serena, but without success. In the case of the Gale, it has proved impossible to establish the identity of the beneficial owner.Crews are poorly protected throughout the industry, with unpaid wages and abandonment by owners all-too frequent. But Denis says shadow vessels are the worst.\"Now I'll be more careful,\" he says. \"I've learned to identify dangerous vessels that I won't work on any more.\"The ships brought back from the deadDeep within the murky recesses of the shadow fleet also lurks a category experts have dubbed \"zombie ships\" - vessels which steal the identity of dead ships in order to hide their true identity.After being sanctioned, a zombie ship often disappears from tracking systems, later reappearing under a new name, using a stolen nine-digit International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number from a scrapped or decommissioned vessel.The ship's AIS tracking system, which uses transponders to continuously broadcast its location, is re-programmed to imitate the previous vessel.With the dead tanker's identity magically resurrected, the zombie ship continues to ply its trade, free from sanctions.The Gale is one such ship.According to the global trade intelligence company Kpler, the tanker, currently flying a false Gambian flag, has assumed multiple identities since being sanctioned by the US last year for its involvement in the export of sanctioned Iranian oil.After a period sailing under the false identity Sea Shell, using a different stolen IMO number, the Gale again changed identities, re-emerging as Beeta and loading a cargo of Iranian oil on 31 January.According to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite imagery, AIS data and shoreline photography to follow the movement of crude oil, the shipment was delivered by another US-sanctioned vessel via a ship-to-ship transfer, a procedure commonly used by shadow-fleet vessels involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil.Copernicus Sentinel 2, 2026Satellite imagery shows the Gale (Beeta) loading a cargo of Iranian oil in a ship-to-ship tranferThe ship-to-ship transfer took place south of the Riau Archipelago, around 150 miles east of Singapore.Windward AI's Michelle Wiese Bockmann calls the area \"an epicentre of maritime lawlessness\", where dozens of tankers gather to store or transfer Iranian oil.Bockmann says China imported 1.8 million barrels per day of sanctioned Iranian crude per day in 2025. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy for a response.\"None of it was traced,\" she says, \"because tankers hide their loading and the oil has come on four or five tankers, deliberately to obscure the origin and destination of the cargo.\"The Gale's history and behaviour mark it out as a classic zombie ship.A computer screenshot taken on board by the crew member who contacted the ITF appears to give instructions on how to fake the ship's location, a process known as spoofing.Two other screenshots, taken on 26 January, show the spoofing at work.One displays the tanker's actual location, east of Singapore. The second, taken just five minutes later, shows a fake location, around 2,800 miles away, off the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.\"The confirmed linkage between Gale, Sea Shell, and Beeta, alongside fabricated AIS position history and prior impersonation, is consistent with deliberate identity manipulation,\" says Ana Subasic, an analyst at the global trade intelligence company Kpler.The BBC has no reason to believe the Serena is a zombie vessel, but the ship's former engineer says he saw equipment that would enable the Serena to fake its position.\"I spoke with the bridge officers about turning off the AIS and other manipulation,\" Denis told us. \"We had equipment on board to change the vessel's position. I think this equipment is only used for sanctioned cargo.\"What can be done?Such practices, coupled with the knowledge that Russian and Iranian oil revenues continue to fuel conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, are driving an urgent debate in western capitals about how to respond.Donald Trump's recent actions in Venezuela – seizing seven tankers since early December as part of a pressure campaign on the regime of then president Nicolás Maduro – has shown that one solution is the simple application of force.The operation to chase and capture one vessel, the Russian-flagged tanker Marinera, took the US military, including a coastguard vessel and special forces, on a two-week chase far out into the North Atlantic.The Marinera, previously known as the Guyanese-flagged Bella 1, was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and Iran.Getty ImagesBella 1, renamed Marinera, was intercepted in the early hours of 7 JanuaryThe change of name and flag was designed to provide the tanker with a measure of international protection.Upping the ante further, Russia took the highly unusual step of requesting that the US call off its pursuit and said it had dispatched a submarine to escort the tanker, which was empty at the time. The Russian Foreign Ministry said there was not \"any basis\" to allege the tanker was sailing \"without a flag\" or \"under a false flag\".Undeterred by the possibility of an international incident or by the possible accusation of piracy on the high seas, the US intercepted the Marinera in international waters between Iceland and the UK in the early hours of 7 January.Getty ImagesThe Russian-flagged Marinera - seen in January in Burghead, Scotland - was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and IranFor the first time, the UK got involved, sending an RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship to help the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\" and said the UK was \"stepping up activity against shadow vessels\".Perhaps spurred on by Washington's assertive approach, there is some evidence that European partners are willing to take more robust action too.Two weeks after the Marinera episode, France launched an operation in the Mediterranean to seize the Grinch, another Russia-linked tanker suspected of violating international sanctions.ReutersA French navy boat stopping the Grinch oil tankerOnce again, the UK was involved. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS Dagger, shadowed the Grinch, as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.With at least one sanctioned vessel passing through the English Channel every day, according to experts, speculation is mounting that the UK might soon conduct its own interceptions.Healey recently told MPs that \"further military options\" were being explored.For some, it can't come soon enough.\"There's obviously huge frustration in the policy-maker circles in Brussels and London that Russia is continuing to sell its oil,\" says Tom Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.Keatinge runs a maritime sanctions task force at Rusi, bringing together representatives from industry and government. Some participants, he sees, are keen to see more forthright action.\"We have people… who like jumping out of helicopters on ropes,\" he says. \"And that community has thus far been kept firmly in its box.\"He adds: \"Put bluntly, no one's had the balls to look at what is often a 50-50 call and say 'We'll send the boys in'.\" The MoD said: \"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government.\"But the constraints are considerable.\"You've got a bunch of consequences that you need to be ready to deal with,\" Keatinge says. \"The first is you've got an absolutely enormous vessel. What the hell do you do with that?\"Once seized, tankers need to be maintained, with engines running and a skeleton crew on board. The appetite for holding such vessels, particularly older ones that might pose an environmental risk, is minimal.The Marinera remains moored in the Moray Firth, with other US-seized vessels being held off the coast of Texas and Puerto Rico.\"If you look at the very high costs that the US is probably incurring at the moment to have two tankers off Houston, awaiting legal action, it's not something you take lightly,\" says Bockmann.A problem of resourcesThen there's the question of what to do with the oil itself.Again, Trump's approach is blunt: confiscate it.The president says 50 million barrels have been taken so far, as the US assumes control of Venezuela's oil industry.\"Venezuela is going to get some and we're going to get some,\" he said in a recent interview.The president's European allies are unlikely to follow suit.\"That would probably be a step too far for the Foreign Office,\" says Keatinge.So would Ukraine's increasingly direct approach. In recent months, Kyiv has targeted at least seven Russian shadow fleet tankers, using a variety of drones and mines.ReutersA Ukrainian sea drone shows the Dashan, a tanker part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\", being struck by another sea drone in the Black SeaMost of Ukraine's attacks have been in the Black Sea, but one tanker, the Qendil, was hit and critically damaged while passing through the Mediterranean in December. Another tanker, the Mersin, was attacked and immobilised off the coast of Senegal in late November. Kyiv has not commented on reports that it carried out the attack.Most of the international effort so far has been more bureaucratic than kinetic: sanctioning hundreds of vessels, persuading countries such as The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Comoros, among others, to tighten their regulations, and addressing the issue of insurance.The number of falsely flagged ships globally more than doubled last year to over 450, according to the IMO, the BBC reported in November.Last year, the European Commission introduced new rules requiring all vessels entering EU waters to provide proof of insurance.The UK has a similar, voluntary reporting scheme, but shadow fleet vessels often ignore it or alter course when challenged.Ultimately, the sheer number of shadow vessels poses a simple problem of resources.But with Russian ships sometimes suspected of involvement in the monitoring or sabotage of undersea cables, there's an added national security dimension.In late January, the UK and thirteen other countries with Baltic and North Sea coastlines issued a coordinated warning that AIS manipulation, along with interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems represented a growing threat to maritime safety and security.Vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the statement said, \"may be treated as a ship without nationality\", under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a reminder to anyone paying attention that existing laws already provide for the detention and seizure of ships.Windward AI's Bockmann says the Trump administration's actions over Venezuela have shown European leaders what can be done.\"There's definitely a low threshold [for intervention] building for the darkest of the dark fleet,\" she says.More from InDepthThe net is gradually closing on Russian oil. Last October, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the country's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.The EU's next sanctions package against Russia may include a full ban on maritime services, making it impossible for European tankers to transport Russian oil under the legal price cap currently in place.Around 30% of Russia's maritime oil exports are currently carried on EU-owned vessels.But for Russia and Iran, war and sanctions are the mothers of invention. As the net tightens, you can be sure that the world's burgeoning fleet of shadow vessels will continue to operate in the dark.Top picture: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Fear and Gibson target GB's first medal - Wednesday's guideImage caption, Updated 10 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day five: Wednesday, 11 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by – the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final.Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022.Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15).Day six: Thursday, 12 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).Daily highlightsSkeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)This event promises to be one of the most entertaining – and open – of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka, Breezy Johnson, and Emma Aicher are in good form.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05.

Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season.

The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held.

She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10).

At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45).

The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10).

The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014.

Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05.

Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day.

Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage.

The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty ImagesThe prime minister wore the smiles of a survivor and his team wore expressions of relief.The Panshanger Community Centre in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, was bedecked with Union flag bunting and plastic chairs.I was there as it was my turn to conduct what is known as a pool interview on behalf of all of the broadcasters.At the start of the year, Sir Keir Starmer had hoped trips like this would be a regular focus.On the first day back in January he invited us reporters to a similar community centre in Reading. But loads of the questions were about Venezuela and Greenland.A later planned trip was postponed and a news conference held in Downing Street instead, such were the dominance and volume of international news.Sir Keir has long been keen to talk about the cost of living, but the opportunity cost of chaos, both international and then domestic, has made that a whole lot harder. The space to be heard gets squeezed.A cabinet minister expressed this frustration to me the other day: they felt there was evidence slowly emerging of things picking up economically, but not the capacity to talk about it.Maybe, just maybe, they may get a chance now.The magnitude of Monday, the genuine peril the prime minister faced, meant that many including some officials in Downing Street thought for at least a while that Sir Keir might have to announce his resignation before the day was out - as our chief political correspondent, Henry Zeffman, reports here.But the scale and imminence of the threat prompted the depth and breadth of hastily expressed and (potentially time-limited) support we then saw from the cabinet and later from MPs.It has cleared some political air for Sir Keir for now.But the fundamentals, the catalysts that drove events towards this week's crescendo, remain unaltered.An unpopular government led by an unpopular prime minister will continue to prompt those on his own side to ponder alternative leaders, unless it and he respectively become less unpopular pretty quickly.But it is also true that for many, many Labour MPs, whatever their view of their leader, the prospect of a turbulent leadership contest, while in government, feels irresponsible and potentially very damaging to them.And yet tricky imminent elections point to headaches on the horizon.In the meantime Downing Street has to deal with the consequences of how the last few weeks have played out.The prime minister is having to make the best of things with Anas Sarwar, Labour's leader in Scotland, who publicly called for him to resign. Sir Keir still wants Sarwar to become Scotland's first minister. But the Labour campaign looks awkward, to put it gently, given the two men are at odds on the fundamental of whether Sir Keir is up to being prime minister.Then there is the Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who appears to be able to get away with rather a lot while remaining in the cabinet. Streeting's decision, off his own bat, to publish his text exchanges with Lord Mandelson prompted the prime minister to issue a coded rebuke of his health secretary. By publicly underlining the importance of a \"managed process\" for the release of material relating to the former ambassador, he was signalling Streeting's unilateral release of exchanges clearly wasn't.It is a reminder of just how much material is due to be published relating to Lord Mandelson in the coming months, with huge potential for embarrassment personally and diplomatically.For now, though, the prime minister appears fired up.The adrenalin, frustration and anger provoked by recent days was visible publicly, which is rare for Sir Keir.How much changes now, and how much you notice, are two of the key questions as the prime minister attempts to reset, yet again.",

    "body": "6 hours agoBBC\"Terror probe into school stabbing\" is the headline in the Daily Telegraph following an attack on two boys, aged 12 and 13, in North London. The two pupils remain in hospital. A 13-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, the paper writes. A picture of teary-eyed Norwegian Olympic athlete Sturla Holm Lagried also makes the front page in \"the Olympic cheating scandal you didn't expect\". Lagried told press he had cheated on his girlfriend after winning a bronze medal in \"one of the most unusual interviews in Olympic history\".The Times also features the counter-terrorism police's investigation into the stabbing at Kingsbury High School, highlighting the head teacher's description of the event as \"deeply traumatic\". It also says the investigation into Lord Mandelson's relationship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will \"go back to Blair era\". The peer's appointment to the position of British ambassador to the US has come under fresh scrutiny after the latest release of Epstein files by the US Department of Justice. It was publicly known at the time of the appointment that Lord Mandelson had maintained a relationship with Epstein after his conviction for a child sex offence. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The Guardian says Health Secretary Wes Streeting is \"still intent on deposing PM despite united front\".  His allies tell the paper they expect he will make an attempt to topple Sir Keir Starmer \"within weeks\".Allies of the PM \"admit Starmer is too 'weak' to sack Streeting after coup speculation\", according to the Financial Times. The paper also reports on US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick who has said he visited Epstein's island in 2012.                                                                           The i Paper headlines on the news of Lord Doyle losing the Labour whip \"over link to sex offender\". The prime minister's \"ex-No 10 spin doctor\" was suspended after he campaigned for Labour councillor Sean Morton who was charged with possessing indecent images of children in 2017. He has apologised for his past association with Morton.The Daily Express highlights comments from Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch that Labour's taxes are a \"shameful assault\" on high streets. This comes \"amid warnings that small firms face an apocalypse\", the paper writes. The Daily Star calls Starmer a \"limp lettuce\" in a nod to its livestream of a lettuce during Liz Truss's premiership. It says that Larry the No 10 cat is \"fed up with Labour's in-fighting\", headlining with \"get miaowt of here\". \"Leo was gentle and kind... the heartbreak will never end\" headlines the Mirror on the comments from the father of 12-year-old Leo Ross, killed in a stabbing in Birmingham. There is a \"knives epidemic in our schools\" says the Mirror. The Daily Mail leads with the North London stabbing, saying witnesses claim the attacker shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" at the time. The paper also says it has revealed \"where shamed Fergie's hiding - while plotting return\".The Sun leads with the story of Strictly Come Dancing's Robin Windsor's suicide note, which it says detailed that he was \"destroyed\" by Strictly. The inquest continues.Metro leads with the story of a \"DIY drugs baron\" who it says \"rigged his house with Home Alone-style booby traps inlcuding a flame-thrower to stop intruders\". Ian Claughton has now been jailed and is \"going down... in flames!\" Related Internet Links",

It is water-repellent and was originally used on sailboats, external to make them glide better before being introduced to skiing in the 1980s.There were also health and environmental concerns as it does not biodegrade and is a 'forever chemical', while it has also been linked with a number of illnesses and conditions.The FIS said the Korean pair had allegedly violated a rule that bans fluorinated wax because it \"can be a competitive advantage\".Ranked 157 and 158 in the World Cup respectively, Han and Lee were not expected to be in the running for medals at the Milan-Cortina Games.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJessica RawnsleyPA MediaForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper boards a helicopter during her visit to Norway to discuss Nato's presence in the ArcticThe number of British troops in Norway will double over the next three years as part of efforts to combat Russian threats in the High North.Defence Secretary John Healey said the number of armed forces personnel stationed in the Arctic nation would rise from around 1,000 to 2,000.The commitment follows increasing concern among Nato allies about Russia's activities in the Arctic, including the reopening of old Cold War bases and a growing military presence in the region.\"Demands on defence are rising and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War,\" Healey said.The defence secretary will join Nato counterparts at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the proposals.As part of the expanded presence, 1,500 Royal Marine Commandos will take part in Nato's Exercise Cold Response in March. The large-scale drill across Norway, Finland and Sweden is designed to train allied forces in extreme Arctic conditions.In September, the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force will conduct an exercise known as Lion Protector involving air, land and naval forces from several European nations. That operation will train armed forces to defend critical infrastructure against attacks and sabotage across Norway, Iceland and the Danish straits.The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.There has been a 30% rise in Russian submarines in UK waters over the past two years, according to the MoD.The defence ministry has said Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is now back to the same levels as the Cold War era.More on this story",

Russian forces also dropped seven bombs on the city of Slovyansk on Tuesday, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. Three people, including an 11-year-old girl, were killed.Moscow has increased pressure on the area by targeting transport and energy infrastructure with a record number of ballistic missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.A state of emergency has been declared over the energy situation in the Kharkiv region by local authorities.It comes after a so-called \"energy truce\", which was meant to allow Ukraine's energy sector a reprieve during -20C (-4F) temperatures, expired last week.Tens of thousands of people across Ukraine are experiencing severe power cuts, and many households have no running water or heating.Zelensky has said the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, and that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week. Meanwhile, a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on Wednesday night.Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov said an apartment was damaged in the strike and a fire broke out at a factory. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "body": "13 hours agoNick Johnson,Bruce ThainandImogen JamesPA MediaPaul Dacre started giving evidence on Tuesday, and will return to the High Court on WednesdayFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has told the High Court he \"utterly refutes\" the \"preposterous\" allegations of unlawful newsgathering at the paper. Seven people, including Prince Harry and Sir Elton John, are suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday - for \"grave breaches of privacy\".  Dacre is the current editor-in-chief of DMG Media Ltd, the holding company of ANL, which denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.He told the court he was \"angry and upset\" for his staff at the newspapers as the allegations had \"cast a dark shadow over their lives for the past three years\".On Tuesday Dacre was back in court, facing similar questions from the same barrister, David Sherborne, who is representing the seven claimants. Dacre told the trial that he \"wasn't aware\" of the extent of the paper's use of private investigators - who he referred to as \"inquiry agents\" - until around 2007 when he \"brought the shutters down\".Sherborne asked Dacre whether his involvement in the case \"is motivated by a desire to protect your legacy\" rather than getting a fair outcome. Dacre admitted wanting to clear his name, but also said he cared about the \"honest and dedicated\" staff at the paper.Regarding allegations that hacking and tapping phones was \"habitual and widespread\" at the Daily Mail, Dacre said: \"I utterly reject this. Such blatant illegality would not, I believe, have been countenanced at any level on the paper I edited.\"He added that he is sure if he was told there was evidence a journalist or agent had blagged information, he would \"have been pretty furious\". The \"sometimes preposterous allegations\" have \"in the small hours of the night – reduced me to rage\" he wrote in his witness statement, adding that they have had a \"deeply upsetting and, in some instances, traumatic impact\" on past and present Daily Mail staff. Another of the claimants, Baroness Lawrence, is the mother of the murdered black schoolboy Stephen Lawrence. When Stephen was murdered, the Daily Mail campaigned on her behalf.In her claim, Lawrence alleges that ANL targeted her with hidden electronic surveillance, tapped her phone and monitored her bank account.Dacre told the court on Tuesday that \"my heart bleeds for Doreen Lawrence\"In his statement he added Lawrence's claims in relation to the campaign \"are especially bewildering and bitterly wounding to me personally.\"At times, the atmosphere between Sherborne and Dacre was combative. At one stage, Sherborne suggested \"you choose to remember the things that might be helpful, and deliberately forget the things that might be unhelpful\".Right at the end of the day, Mr Justice Nicklin scolded Sherborne and said he was treating his questioning like a public inquiry. \"I don't consider the large bulk of questions to have any real relevance to the issues I have to decide,\" he added.Dacre will return to the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday to continue giving evidence. The trial before Mr Justice Nicklin is due to conclude in March. A written judgment is expected to be issued at a later date.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandClaire KeenanReutersBritney Spears has sold the rights to her music catalogue.Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned. Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.In January 2024, the singer said she would \"never return to the music industry\". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022. Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston. Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public. High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too. Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue. Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999. The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father. The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship. Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025. ",

    "body": "Disney advert banned for showing 'disturbing' severed body8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporter20th Century StudiosA still from the Predator Badlands film that was not included in the advert banned by the ASAA \"menacing\" Disney advert featuring a severed body has been banned by the advertising regulator, which said it was likely to frighten and cause distress to children. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found the entertainment giant had broken its rules with its advert for the Predator Badlands film.Parents complained that the digital poster, which featured a large alien holding aloft the severed body of a smaller, human figure, was \"inappropriate and disturbing for young children\".Disney said the severed body was actually that of a robot, and the fact it had been cut in two \"further emphasised its non-human nature\".The advert, which was seen on the roadside in Giffnock, Glasgow, was promoting the Disney sci-fi film ahead of its release in November.It featured a large, alien character, resembling a human but with a distorted head shape and muzzled mouth.The alien creature was holding up a severed human figure by the neck, with its bottom half of the figure's body missing and its spine exposed.Other scenes in the large digital poster advert featured close-up shots of the alien's distorted face and sharp fangs, captioned \"welcome to a world of hurt\".Two parents complained to the ASA about the advert, arguing it was inappropriate and disturbing for young children and therefore unsuitable to be displayed outdoors.Advertising Standards AuthorityDisney subsidiary Twentieth Century Studios, which produced the film, said it was rated 12A, and the advertisement had been designed with that in mind. The company argued the brief and stylised nature of the scene meant the alien character or other imagery used would be unlikely to cause harm or offence.It also argued the character which had been cut in two was a \"synth\", or robot, and did not look like a human, adding that the fact it had been severed made it look even less human-like.The severed body appeared for less than two seconds in a 10-second advert, Disney added.Previous versions of the artwork had also been \"sense checked\" by third parties and amended based on that feedback, the studio said, adding that action \"showed a willingness\" to meet social responsibility standards.Despite Disney's arguments, the ASA said the firm had a duty to ensure scenes in its adverts are \"suitable for a general audience\", including young children.It said the alien, depicted after having dismembered the smaller figure featured in the advert, \"appeared menacing\".\"Whilst we acknowledged Twentieth Century Studio's comment that the smaller figure was not actually a human, but rather a 'synth' robot, we considered that was not clear from the ad,\" the ASA added.The watchdog said the smaller figure's severed torso and exposed spine was gory, and would be \"disturbing to younger children\".It said the close-up shots of the alien's face, and \"welcome to a world of hurt\" caption, would also have frightened younger kids.The advert breached the social responsibility and harm and offence provisions of the UK's advertising code, it concluded.As a result, the ASA banned the advert and ordered that it \"must not appear again in its current form\", while reminding Disney to ensure adverts with the potential to cause distress are not able to be seen by children in future.A Disney spokesperson said: \"We acknowledge the ASA's ruling. We take our responsibilities to audiences very seriously and strive to work closely with partners to meet the required standards.\"",

    "body": "56 minutes agoKoh EweGetty ImagesSavannah Guthrie and her siblings have released videos on social media pleading for their mother's releasePolice have detained a person in connection to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie.Police are also searching the home of the person, who was taken into custody at a traffic stop, sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.The Pima County Sherrif's Department later confirmed that police were conducting a court-authorised search at a location in Rio Rico, south of Tuscon, Arizona.Guthrie, 84, was abducted from her home near Tucson more than a week ago, sparking a widespread search and desperate appeals from her family. Authorities have not released any details about the person being held.A woman who identified herself as the mother-in-law of the detained person said he had nothing to do with the case.\"They're just invading my property,\" she was quoted as saying by CBS.The news of the detention came hours after the FBI released images and videos of a masked person at Nancy Guthrie's doorstep on the night of her disappearance. Authorities said the individual was armed.\"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement on X.He said authorities had been working to recover images from the home surveillance system that \"may have been lost, corrupted, or inaccessible due to a variety of factors - including the removal of recording devices\".The two short videos show the person approach the front door of Nancy Guthrie's home, then check the camera before moving away, picking up some vegetation from the ground and using it to cover the camera lens.Savannah Guthrie shared the new video on Instagram. \"Someone out there recognises this person,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.\"ReutersPolice search the home of a person who was detained in connection to Nancy Guthrie's disappearanceA senior official told CBS that the White House was monitoring the situation in Tucson closely. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that US President Donald Trump had reviewed the surveillance footage. Trump's initial reaction to the footage was \"pure disgust\", Leavitt said in response to a question at the press briefing.\"The President directed me to please encourage all Americans with any information to call the FBI,\" she added.US President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities to help in the investigation, previously called the case \"very unusual\".Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly 6 miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on 31 January evening, when family members dropped her off.FBIThe FBI has released images and videos of a masked person at Nancy Guthrie's doorstepAuthorities are investigating a series of ransom notes that could have been from her abductors, including one that contained two deadlines: 5 February and 9 February.Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have released several videos on social media pleading for their mother's release.The latest video was posted on Monday - the reported ransom deadline. In it, Savannah Guthrie pleads for the public to help locate her missing mother. \"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" she said in a the video posted on Instagram. \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help.\"The family has warned about their mother's ill health, saying that her health and heart were \"fragile\" and she \"lives in constant pain\".\"She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer,\" the news anchor said in a video posted on Instagram.Officials have also warned that Nancy Guthrie may be in dire health without her medication.Authorities said on the night of her disappearance, the app on her pacemaker - an implanted cardiac device - disconnected from her phone.Police also said they found blood on Guthrie's porch and analysis confirmed it was hers.The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information on the case.",

    "body": "If it feels like the rain just hasn't stopped this year, you might be on to something. Cardinham in Cornwall has recorded some rain every single day of the year so far.Katesbridge (County Down) and Aboyne (Aberdeenshire) recorded nearly four times their January average rainfall, and history is repeating itself this month. We're not even at the half way point of the month and Aboyne has already had well over double the February average rainfall.As wet as this winter has been, it's unlikely to beat the rainfall of the wettest winter on record, the winter of 2013-14.In the south-west England and South Wales region, data from the Met Office shows that 691mm of rain fell then, causing widespread severe flooding. Combining the figures for December 2025 and January 2026 gives us 415mm, but already the record looks to be far out of reach.One parallel between this winter and the winter of 2013-14 is the damage done to the main railway line at Dawlish that connects southwest England to the rest of the rail network. You might remember in February 2014 that the track was left dangling precariously high in the air as storms washed away the protecting sea wall. This winter has also seen a section of sea wall collapse due to the onslaught of storms causing some disruption.Why so wet? Around 17 January a blocking area of high pressure developed in Scandinavia and it's still there to this day. This has prevented areas of low pressure from moving beyond the UK, so they've become slow-moving, bringing very wet weather, with south-west winds to the south of the UK and south-easterly winds to the north of the UK. This wind pattern is responsible for the distribution of rain. It's worth pointing out that it hasn't been wet everywhere. North-west England and west Scotland had a much drier January than normal, and parts of the Highlands have only recorded 1mm of rain so far this month.The Scandinavian blocking area of high pressure is finally going to budge this week, allowing our weather to turn colder with some hill snow in the north later this week.Next week our weather patterns will become more typical for the time of year with the Atlantic jet stream returning to the north-west of Scotland, rather than taking an unusual position near Morocco. There will still be rain around as we'd expect in winter, but some of the wettest weather will return to west Scotland. The rain won't be as extreme in east Scotland. In the southwest of England, it won't rain every single day, there will be drier and sunnier days between our weather systems.Heading towards the end of February, there are hints that an area of high pressure may visit our shores, bringing some more settled weather conditions. It's a long way off, but it's the least we deserve given just how wet and dull it's been over recent weeks. ",

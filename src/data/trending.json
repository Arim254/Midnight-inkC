Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. Sarah, Anthony, Justin and Marianna all joined Matt Chorley on 5 Live today to answer these questions and plenty more.\nHOSTS:\n* Matt Chorley, 5 Live presenter \n* Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve and Laura Cain.

    "body": "Hewlett Packard (HP) is seeking $1.7bn (£1.3bn) from the estate of Mike Lynch - who died last year when his yacht sank - over HP's acquisition of his firm Autonomy, the tech giant's lawyers have told the High Court.HP, now known as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), bought Mr Lynch's tech firm Autonomy in 2011, but it says Mr Lynch and Autonomy's former chief financial officer, Sushovan Hussain, misrepresented the company's finances.In a 2019 trial, HPE had accused Mr Lynch of inflating Autonomy's revenues which it said forced it to announce an $8.8bn write-down of the company's worth.Mr Justice Hildyard ruled in 2022 that HPE had \"substantially succeeded\" in its claim, but that it was likely to receive \"substantially less\" than the $5bn it sought in damages.Earlier this year, he ruled that HPE suffered losses amounting to around £700m through the purchase of Autonomy.Mr Lynch and his teenage daughter Hannah were among seven passengers and crew who died when the Bayesian went down off the coast of Sicily last August during a storm which caused the vessel to capsize and sink.A hearing in London, which began on Tuesday, will now decide whether Mr Lynch's estate can appeal against the 2022 and 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Patrick Goodall, the barrister representing HPE, argued that Mr Lynch's estate was liable to pay $1.7bn, which includes around $761m in interest.He said that Mr Lynch had \"not only perpetrated an enormous fraud, but lied about it at every stage\".He said the claimants had spent almost £150m on the legal battle, and were seeking nearly £113m of their costs from Mr Lynch's estate.Mr Goodall also said that Mr Lynch's estate should not be allowed to appeal against either the 2022 or 2025 rulings.In written submissions, Richard Hill, the lawyer representing Mr Lynch's estate, said that the $761m in interest sought by the claimants was an \"excessive sum... based on a flawed analysis\" and that the \"legally and economically rational approach would provide for a materially lower figure\".The claimants' position that \"they were the victors in this litigation\" was \"overly simplistic\", he added.Mr Hill also said that Mr Lynch's estate should be allowed to appeal against the two earlier rulings, claiming that the judge \"erred in law\" and that there was a \"compelling reason for allowing the appeal to be heard\".A spokesperson for the Lynch family said: \"Today's hearing addresses technical matters that change nothing about the underlying substance of the case.\"The core facts remain that HP's claim was fundamentally flawed and a wild overstatement.\"In a separate case, Mr Lynch was extradited to the US in 2023 to face criminal charges, and he was cleared of fraud charges in 2024.He was celebrating being acquitted on his yacht when it sank.",

US President Donald Trump and the Crown Prince of Saudia Arabia Mohammed bin Salman are pictured clasping hands at the White House on the front page.The Guardian says the LinkedIn profiles in question were designed as a \"covert and calculated\" attempt to recruit parliamentarians and obtain \"non-public and insider insights\". It says that the profiles were under the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen. The Independent says a \"new row\" has erupted between London and Beijing after the MI5 alert to British politicians. It reports the Chinese embassy in the UK dismissing the accusations as \"pure fabrication and malicious slander\".As well as the MI5 story, the Financial Times front pages also features Trump and the crown prince prominently. It says the president lashed out at a reporter who asked about the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi regime who was murdered at the country's Istanbul embassy in 2018. Trump said his White House guest \"new nothing about\" the killing, seemingly contradicting the assessment of US intelligence agencies.The Telegraph says Britain is \"not ready to defend\" itself against an invasion. After a year-long inquiry, the Commons defence committee accused the government of moving at a \"glacial\" pace in the face of renewed threats from Russia and China. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured on the paper's front page following her first public speech in more than two years.The i newspaper claims Chancellor Rachel Reeves told a meeting of Labour MPs that a tax on high-value properties will be included in her Budget next week. The chancellor urged MPs to \"sell the message\" that new tax rises will fall hardest on wealthy people, according to the paper.Both the Mirror and Guardian carry claims by former schoolmates of Nigel Farage who say the Reform UK leader held \"racist and antisemitic\" views while a teenager. The party says the allegations are \"entirely without foundation\" and a \"smear\".The Metro leads on comments made by Google boss Sundar Pichai to BBC News. He told the BBC that people should not \"blindly trust\" AI models, which he said were prone to errors.The Mail leads on an investigation into the death of teacher John Wright. The paper claims he took his own life after being sacked by an elite private school for making what the Mail describes as a \"few ill-advised remarks\". Marlborough College has insisted he was dismissed for \"inappropriate conduct\".The Express says asylum seekers have been filmed \"partying and fighting\" at their temporary accommodation at a Ministry of Defence site in Essex. It calls the scenes \"raving mad\".Finally, the Daily Star leads on the news that the BBC's beloved crime drama Line of Duty is making a sensational comeback. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Holocaust survivor Vera Schaufeld has been hailed for her \"strength and courage\", following her death at the age of 95.In a tribute, the Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) said the \"extraordinary ambassador\" had \"inspired countless people\", which reflected \"just how much her work mattered\".Ms Schaufeld was made an MBE at Buckingham Palace in 2019 for her services to Holocaust remembrance and education and, later that year, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Roehampton.She was born in Prague in 1930 and at the age of nine was told she had to move to England on her own following the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia.She saw her parents for the last time in 1939, before she fled the country on Sir Nicholas Winton's Kindertransport.The Kindertransport movement was set up to evacuate Jewish children from Germany and other European countries in the wake of Kristallnacht - a night of co-ordinated violence by the Nazis in November 1938 which resulted in the destruction of hundreds of synagogues and Jewish properties across the German Reich.Her parents remained in what is now the Czech Republic and were sent to a concentration camp where they were later murdered.Michael Newman, chief executive of the AJR, said: \"Despite being only nine years old, Vera's strength and courage shone through, as she bravely waved farewell to her parents, never to see them again.\"Ms Schaufeld was raised in England and, after the war, she trained as a teacher and spent some time in Israel, where she met her husband, Avram.When the pair returned to England, Ms Schaufeld continued teaching, sharing her testimony in schools and colleges, and began her work as an ambassador for remembrance and education.Mr Newman said: \"Within the association, Vera's dedication was unfaltering; she generously shared her testimony in our Refugee Voices archive, giving voice to her experiences as a Winton child and participated in many engagements, lectures, and educational events.\"Through her eloquence and heartfelt storytelling, she brought the human dimension of the Kindertransport to life.\"He added: \"Thank you, Vera, for your unwavering commitment, your strength, and your generosity. Your voice, your memory, and your spirit will continue to inspire all of us in the AJR - and beyond - for generations to come.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentPalestine ActionOne defendant is accused of striking an officer across the back with his sledgehammerAn alleged Palestine Action member attacked a police officer with a sledgehammer, fracturing her back, during an organised break-in at an Israeli defence firm, a court has heard.Woolwich Crown Court was told that six people accused of breaking in to Elbit Systems near Bristol had meticulously planned the incident on 6 August 2024 to cause as much damage as possible to the factory.Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31, are jointly accused of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder.They deny all charges and Mr Corner denies an additional allegation of causing grievous bodily harm.Opening the trial on Tuesday, Mr Justice Johnson told jurors that the allegations they would consider predate Palestine Action's proscription under terrorism laws this June. He added that the ban was not for them to consider and was irrelevant to the evidence in this case.Beginning the prosecution's case, Deanna Heer KC, said that the six defendants had been \"willing participants\" in a plan to cause damage to the plant, which manufacturers defence technology equipment.Wearing red jumpsuits and carrying sledgehammers, they used a prison van, allegedly driven by Charlotte Head, to crash through security fencing, before then breaking into the factory itself, the court heard.Ms Heer told the jury that each of the \"red team\" carried a sledgehammer to cause damage - but they were also prepared to use them as weapons.\"The evidence demonstrates that all of these defendants used them for that purpose, to threaten or to attack the security guards and to lend support to one another as they did so,\" she said.\"When the police arrived, as the defendants knew they would, Samuel Corner attacked them, going so far as to strike a female officer, Sgt Kate Evans, across the back with his sledgehammer while she was on the floor, facing away from him.\"Ms Heer said that the red team had taken three minutes to gain access to factory, first cutting into a roller door and then smashing through it with the prison van.\"Inside the warehouse, the Red Team set about destroying as much property as they could,\" said Ms Heer, adding the group was armed with sledgehammers, whips, and fireworks.'Screamed in pain'\"They used fire extinguishers filled with red paint to spray the walls and floor.\"They used crowbars and hammers to damage computer equipment and boxes of technical products, which they smashed apart.\"The fabric of the building was also damaged, not only the loading bay but also the security systems and even the disabled toilet,\" she added.Footage played in the opening address was said to show Zoe Rogers brandishing and swinging a sledgehammer in front of a security guard, Angelo Volante.He also said he had been whipped by Charlotte Head and threatened with a saw by Leona Kamio.Eventually he retreated - but later returned with the police. As he led officers into the factory, video played to the jury on Tuesday was said to show Ms Kamio raising her sledgehammer over her head and bringing it down towards him.She was then tasered - but continued to resist arrest. The video is then said to show Samuel Corner approaching Sgt Evans and striking her back with a sledgehammer.\"Having hit her once, he raised the sledgehammer again and hit her with it a second time,\" said Ms Heer.\"Fortunately, Sgt Evans was wearing a stab vest which may have absorbed the force of the impacts. Nevertheless she screamed in pain as she felt the force of the blows.\"She was immediately terrified that her spine had been damaged and when she tried, she was unable to get up.\"Sgt Evans suffered a fractured vertebrae and was unable to work for three months. Due to the ongoing impact of the injury, she has been confined to restricted duties.The trial is expected to last until January.Related internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAdverts by four of Britain's biggest hotel and travel firms have been banned for stating misleading minimum prices for rooms.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints against the Hilton hotel group, Travelodge, Booking.com and Accor over their use of eye-catching so-called \"from\" prices.The watchdog found only a small number of rooms actually available to book at the promoted price and concluded the adverts overstated the deals.It said this was unfair on those looking for good deals or seeking to make informed choices about where to book.ASA operations manager Emily Henwood said: \"Advertised prices must match what's really available. If only a few rooms are actually offered at the price shown, or it only applies to a specific date, then this information must be made clear to avoid misleading people.\"People should be able to trust the prices they see in ads and these rulings show that we will take action if the rules are broken.\"The ASA used AI to identify the misleading adverts as part of a wider probe into the availability of advertised hotel prices.PA MediaThe Hilton hotel group was rebuked over two adverts, one reading \"Hampton by Hilton Hamilton Park From £68\", and the other advertising stays in Newcastle from £59.The ASA asked Hilton whether it could back up the claims, with the hotel offering evidence that rooms were bookable at the hotels on the respective dates the adverts were viewed.But the ASA concluded Hilton had exaggerated the availability of the advertised rooms, leaving potential customers at risk of being misled. It ordered the chain not to publish the adverts again and warned Hilton to ensure any future price claims reflect deals available for \"a significant proportion of rooms\".Travelodge had two adverts banned - one offering rooms in Nottingham Riverside \"from £25\" and the other rooms in Swansea \"from £21\".The ASA found that the advertised prices were only available for a single night's stay, warning Travelodge in future to ensure deals are available \"across a range of dates\".A Travelodge spokesperson said it recognised the need for clarity and transparency in pricing and is working with Google to ensure its adverts are clear and comply with the ASA's guidelines. It said the relevant advert was removed before the ASA's ruling.Similar findings were issued against Booking.com and hotel group Accor, while staycation chain Butlins was criticised for changing the deadline of a sale it promoted via email.Accor told the ASA it believed its adverts were accurate as rooms were available at or below the headline prices in the days following their publication.Booking.com sent the watchdog a screenshot demonstrating that seven bookings had been made at the prices it advertised.A spokesperson told the BBC that Booking.com accurately displays price and availability at the time advertisements are shown and will work with the ASA \"to address any outstanding questions they might have\".The ASA also found Butlin's had breached its code by writing to customers that \"The big Butlin's sale ends in four days\" and \"Time is running out\".The deadline to participate in the sale was eventually extended by two weeks, which the watchdog said was unfair on those who had been put under pressure to book a break before the initial deadline.It urged the firm to ensure future promotions are fair to consumers. Butlins said no customers were disadvantaged by the extension of the sale window.The ASA's findings come after the Competition and Markets Authority on Tuesday launched a probe into eight companies over potentially misleading online price claims.

    "body": "7 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says Saudi crown prince \"knew nothing\" about Jamal Khashoggi's murderUS President Donald Trump said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"knew nothing\" about the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as he welcomed the kingdom's de facto ruler to the White House.Trump's comments appeared to contradict a US intelligence assessment in 2021 which determined the crown prince had approved the operation that led to Khashoggi's death at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. The crown prince, who has denied any wrongdoing, said at the White House that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right things\" to investigate Khashoggi's death, which he called \"painful\".It was his first US visit since the assassination, which sent shockwaves through the US-Saudi relationship. In the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump shot back at a reporter who asked a question about the killing. \"You're mentioning someone that was extremely controversial,\" the US president said. \"A lot of people didn't like that gentleman that you're talking about. Whether you like him or didn't like him, things happen.\" \"But he [the Crown Prince] knew nothing about it,\" Trump added. \"You don't have to embarrass our guests.\"The crown prince added that Saudi Arabia \"did all the right steps\" to investigate the murder, which he called \"painful\" and a \"huge mistake\". A US intelligence report made public in 2021 - under President Joe Biden's administration - determined that the crown prince had approved of a plan to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi in Istanbul. During his first administration, Trump White House officials declined to release the report. While dozens of Saudi officials faced sanctions in the wake of the assassination, none directly targeted the crown prince.At the time, Saudi Arabia rejected the report as \"negative, false and unacceptable\". On Tuesday, Khashoggi's widow called on the crown prince to apologise for her husband's murder, for which she said there was \"no justification\".\"The Crown Prince said he was sorry so he should meet me, apologize and compensate me for the murder of my husband @JKhashoggi,\" Hanan Elatr Khashoggi posted on X. Granted political asylum in the US, she lives in the Washington DC area.Tuesday's meeting between Trump and Mohammed bin Salman was expected to include deals on civilian nuclear power, artificial intelligence and Saudi investment in the US, which the crown prince said was being upped to $1tr (£761bn) from $600bn pledged earlier this year. Echoing Trump's own words, bin Salman said that the US was the \"hottest country on the planet\" and praised the US president for creating \"long-term opportunity\". The two men also discussed the potential sale of advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to the Saudis. Trump said that while export licences were still being announced, he expected a deal between the Saudis and US defence giant Lockheed Martin. The potential sale has caused alarm among some Israeli officials, who have said that it could potentially hurt the country's \"qualitative military edge\" in the Middle East, where it is so far the only nation to have F-35s. The US president said the model sold to the Saudis would be broadly similar to the one the Israelis operate.\"This [Saudi Arabia] is a great ally, and Israel is a great ally,\" Trump said. \"I know they'd like you to get planes of reduced calibre.\"But as far as I'm concerned, I think they are both at a level where they should get top of the line,\" he added. The crown prince's visit to Washington continues with a gala dinner on Tuesday night, followed by an investment summit on Wednesday. Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo - who plays in the Saudi professional league - was also expected to be at the White House on Tuesday, a White House official confirmed to the BBC. Biden did not host the crown prince and vowed to make Saudi Arabia a \"pariah\" over its human rights record. In 2022, however, Biden visited the kingdom to reach agreement on other issues. ",

    "body": "9 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPolice drama Line of Duty is to return to the BBC for a seventh series, with Adrian Dunbar, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston all set to reprise their roles in the hit show.A new six-part series, written by creator Jed Mercurio, will begin filming in Belfast in the spring, the BBC confirmed.McClure said she was \"so excited\" the series was returning, with Dunbar adding: \"What a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year.\"The last series concluded in 2021 with a finale that attracted more than 17 million viewers. Speculation about a return has been rife ever since, but Mercurio and the BBC have not confirmed it until now.The BBC has not yet announced when the new season will hit screens.The finale of series six drew the show's long-running storyline about the hunt for criminal mastermind known as \"H\" to a close, and the BBC and creative team behind the show said at the time there were no plans for any further series. However, the corporation confirmed on Tuesday that a seventh series is now in development.Series seven will open with AC-12 having been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards, the BBC confirmed.Steve Arnott (Compston), Kate Fleming (McClure) and Ted Hastings (Dunbar) are still working to tackle corruption in the police force.The BBC said their line of work \"has never been more difficult, and, in this challenging climate, [the trio] are assigned their most sensitive case so far\".A new character, Det Insp Dominic Gough, a charismatic officer celebrated for a string of takedowns of organised crime, is accused of abusing his position to act as a sexual predator. But his case could be a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat still operating in the shadows, the announcement teased.In a statement, Mercurio said: \"Everyone involved in Line of Duty feels enormous gratitude to the show's fans. \"We're privileged to have had so many of you follow the ups and downs of AC-12 over six previous seasons and we couldn't be more delighted to be returning for a seventh.\"He added: \"Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I've been forced to use my imagination.\"Line of Duty launched in 2012 and went on to become one of the most popular TV drams of the last decade, attracting guest stars such as Stephen Graham, Thandiwe Newton, Kelly Macdonald and Lennie James.Compston described appearing in the police drama as \"a job of a lifetime\". \"Not only in terms of the show's success but the people I've had the opportunity to work with I now call some of my closest friends.\"I can't wait to pull the waistcoat on again and get the team back together,\" he said.McClure added: \"It goes without saying I'm so excited Line of Duty is back! Can't wait to work with Jed, Martin and Adrian again. Belfast, we'll see you soon!\"Dunbar remarked: \"As we count down the AC-12 days of Christmas what a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year. \"Delighted with the news and looking forward to those mercurial twists and turns.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsGettyThe researchers found evidence of kissing in multiple species Humans do it, monkeys do it, even polar bears do it. And now researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary origins of kissing. Their study suggests that the mouth-on-mouth kiss evolved more than 21 million years ago, and was something that the common ancestor of humans and other great apes probably indulged in.The same research concluded that Neanderthals may have kissed too – and that humans and Neanderthals may even have smooched one another.The scientists studied kissing because it presents something of an evolutionary puzzle - it has no obvious survival or reproductive benefits, and yet it is something that is seen not just in many human societies, but across the animal kingdom. GettyThe scientists defined a kiss as mouth-on-mouth contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\"By finding evidence of other animals engaging in kissing, scientists were able to construct an \"evolutionary family tree\" to work out when it was most likely to have evolved.To ensure that they were comparing the same behaviour across different species, the researchers had to give a very precise - rather unromantic - definition to a \"kiss\". In their study, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, they defined kissing as non aggressive, directed oral-oral contact \"with some movement of lips or mouthparts and no food transfer\".\"Humans, chimps, and bonobos all kiss,\" explained lead researcher Dr Matilda Brindle, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Oxford. From that, she concluded, \"it's likely that their most recent common ancestor kissed.\"\"We think kissing probably evolved around 21.5 million years ago in the large apes.\"In this study, scientists found behaviour that matched their scientific definition of kissing in wolves, prairie dogs, polar bears (very sloppy - lots of tongue), and even albatrosses. They focused on primates - and apes in particular - in order to build an evolutionary picture of the origin of the human kiss. The same study also concluded that Neanderthals - our closest ancient human relatives that died out around 40,000 years ago - also kissed. One previous piece of research on Neanderthal DNA also showed that modern humans and Neanderthals shared an oral microbe - a type of bacteria found in our saliva. \"That means that they must have been swapping saliva for hundreds of thousands of years after the two species split,\" explained Dr Brindle.        GettyThe scientists say this behaviour is something 'we share with our non-human relatives'While this study pinpointed when kissing evolved it was not able to answer the question of why. There are already a number of theories - that it arose from grooming behaviour in our ape ancestors or that it might provide an intimate way to assess the health and even the compatibility of a partner. Dr Brindle hopes that this will open a door to answering that question. \"It's important for us to understand that this is something we share with our non-human relatives,\" she said.\"We should be studying this behaviour, not just dismissing it as silly because it has romantic connotations in humans.\"     ",

    "body": "A loose wire on a cargo ship caused a power outage that may have led to the 2024 deadly collapse of Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge, US investigators have said. The Dali container ship, which crashed into the bridge and left six workers dead, was \"preventable\", National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators said during a hearing on Tuesday. Police stationed at the bridge's ends were notified that the ship had veered off course but did not call the construction team's inspector to warn them.  Had the six workers been notified when police were, the NTSB said, they may have had time to evacuate. \"There would have been about one minute and 29 seconds to evacuate\" before the collision, said NTSB engineer Scott Parent, according to the Washington Post.That could have been \"sufficient time to drive to a portion of the bridge that did not collapse\", he said. In the black of night on 26 March 2024, several vehicles on the Scott Key bridge plunged into the icy waters of the River Patapsco in Baltimore, Maryland, after the Dali container ship crashed into one of its pillars. Six workers fell to their deaths.Tuesday's hearing unveiled the potential causes behind the deadly tragedy, as outlined in the NTSB's year-long investigation. The agency identified multiple factors, including the loss of electrical power from a faulty cable, problems with a fuel pump on the ship and a lack of counter measures to reduce the bridge's vulnerability. The NTSB also reviewed its safety recommendations.The findings confirmed those of a 2024 NTSB preliminary report, which had cited faulty cables as the likely cause of an electrical blackout on the Dali in the final moments before collision. \"This tragedy should have never occurred. Lives should have never been lost. As with all accidents we investigate, this was preventable,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said at the hearing. The deadly incident was massively disruptive to the major US shipping Port of Baltimore while it was closed, and severed part of a major interstate roadway.Officials preliminarily estimated the repairs would be completed by 2028 and cost roughly $1.9bn (£1.4bn). However, an update on Monday estimated the total cost of repairs to be closer to $5bn and moved the timeline for completion to 2030.\"Just as families across the country are dealing with the reality of increased costs, so is Maryland,\" the state's Democratic Governor Wes Moore said in a statement on Monday.  \"Trade policies out of Washington, D.C. have raised prices on everything - including essential materials we need in order to rebuild the Francis Scott Key Bridge. \"Still, despite this new economic reality, our resolve is unwavering,\" he said.

    "body": "14 hours agoRobert Cuffe & Matt MurphyBBC VerifyNurPhoto via Getty ImagesNet migration to the UK last year was 20% lower than previously thought, according to revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The number, the difference between those entering and leaving the country, has been revised down by 86,000 people and now stands at 345,000 in 2024.The driving factor behind the change is that more British nationals are thought to have emigrated in 2024 than initially recorded, with 100,000 fewer now thought to be living in the UK.Migration peaked higher than previously thought, according to the figures, adding 944,000 to the UK population between April 2022 and March 2023. Previous estimates put the number at 906,000 by June 2023.When challenged on the migration peak - which occurred under Rishi Sunak's Conservative government - Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said that \"once those figures came out we actually put in quite a few measures to bring immigration down\".\"But we recognise immigration was too high,\" she added during a news conference ahead of next week's budget. \"It was because people took their eye off the ball, allowing bureaucrats to manage our borders - that was not what people voted for when they voted to leave the EU.\"Successive Conservative governments sought to cut migration to the UK, while Labour argued in last year's manifesto that higher migration \"reduces the incentives for businesses to train locally\".In May Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced measures which he said would ensure net migration falls \"significantly\" over the next four years. His proposals included a plan to ban recruitment of care workers from overseas, tighten access to skilled worker visas and raise the costs to employers.The new figures make little change to the overall estimate of net migration to the UK between 2021 and 2024, falling slightly from 2.6 million people to 2.5 million in the revised report.The ONS have been rebuilding the system used to produce official estimates of migration since 2020. Before the pandemic, statisticians asked a small number of passengers at airports and ports about their travel plans and used those responses to work out how many arrivals might be coming to stay.But the results obtained by this method were \"implausibly low\" for British nationals, according to Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory think tank.Officials at the ONS said the new figures are based on how often people appear in tax and benefits records, providing a more accurate and active reflection of migrants activities in the UK.Based on that method, the ONS now thinks that 257,000 British nationals left the UK in 2024 while 143,000 Britons living abroad returned. That means net emigration of Britons - the difference between departures and arrivals - is 114,000 people, rather than its initial estimate of 17,000.Dr Sumption warns that these figures are \"still not final\" because they don't measure when someone enters or leaves the country. That can cause problems if someone stays in the country but disappears from tax and welfare data because they're living on savings.Using that method such a person would usually be counted as an emigrant, skewing migration figures. The ONS has stopped using this method to measure EU migration, instead of using visas and border data shared by the Home Office.Data obtained under the old system estimated that there were 96,000 fewer EU citizens in the UK by the end of 2024, but the new system has revised that estimate downwards to 69,000.Why had migration been rising?Critics have largely attributed the recent increase to changes brought in under Boris Johnson's government from 2021.The three main factors have been identified as an increase in work visas - particularly in health and social care - an increase in student visas, and the opening of humanitarian routes for people from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan.Small boat crossings have also been rising in that time. So far this year, 39,075 people have crossed the Channel.Both Conservative and Labour governments have sought to tackle the rising migration figures. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced restrictions on the rights of students and care workers to bring their families to the UK.On Monday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced sweeping changes to the asylum system, which she said was \"out of control and unfair\".Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"",

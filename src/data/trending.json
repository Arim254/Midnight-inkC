    "body": "Maybe the time is nigh to reimagine what is possible and what is impossible in Scottish football. After this resounding Hearts win in what was deemed the biggest test of their mettle this season, talk of an era ending and a new one beginning may not be as outlandish as so many of us have been programmed into believing.For 40 years the Old Firm hegemony has held. Everybody has become a fatalist. If it wasn't Celtic, it was Rangers. Many - perhaps every - supporter in the land has long since resigned themselves to never seeing a team from outside the big Glasgow two winning the top league. It was just accepted, like night following day.Occasionally a pretender has exploded out of the blocks in early season, winning games, throwing shapes, threatening to upset the way of things, but they've always been cut down by the Glasgow goliaths. And now?Painfully early in the season, it's true. Only nine games played and 29 left to play, as Brendan Rodgers pointed out later, in a somewhat revealing comment about the way he sees the lay of the land. There's still time to catch up was his gist. This is new territory for the Celtic manager.The evidence of our own eyes right now is that Hearts are clearly the best team in the country. That's all we can go on. They've beaten Celtic and Rangers and have beaten them well. They're out-playing, out-scoring and out-defending everybody.They won this game not just because of the effervescence of their attack and the holy trinity of Alexandrios Kyziridis, Lawrence Shankland and Claudio Braga - goalscorers and goal creators yet again - but also in their togetherness and work-rate and absolute desire and self-belief.On a day of noise and colour, Hearts fans goaded their counterparts with their own version of the Celtic Poznan - all linking together, backs to the pitch, bouncing up and down - when Shankland made it 3-1.They did that and more. Cheering every Hearts touch for a spell, belting out 'We shall not be moved' in other moments. Their every utterance was akin to a 'is this all you've got?' message to their visitors. And, yes, that was all Celtic had.Hearts have now scored three goals in three of their last four games and in five of the nine they've played in the Premiership. Against Celtic, they beat their seasonal average shots on target (seven as against a previous average of 5.7). Celtic's Kasper Schmeichel made more saves than in any other league game this season. It wasn't a rout, but it was emphatic. It was an answer to those wondering about Hearts' capacity to live up to the pressure of their biggest game of the season. They did that - and then some.Derek McInnes is building something weighty here. He knows it but he's got far too much savvy to crow about it. He's measured and meticulous and mightily impressive right now. Hearts are great to watch - and from McInnes you get a sense that there's a lot more to come. More new players arriving, others just coming back into the team after injury. Not bit-parters, but big-timers, or so he hopes.There were many moments that stuck in the mind's eye. The relentless nature of the way Hearts began the game, going at Celtic's jugular in a way that only teams with true belief really can.They got their reward with a goal, Dane Murray panicking and hoofing the ball into his own net instead of making a clearance that should have been routine.Celtic put it up to them in the 15 minutes that followed. They scored and should have scored again, but didn't. They'd regret it. You can't fake confidence. You either have it or you don't. The way Hearts roared back and won was the greatest illustration of their merits we've seen so far.And a signal of Celtic's weakness. Showing Kyziridis the inside and inviting him to have a crack is a fool's errand, but that's what they did and that's how they fell behind again.Making jumpy decisions when under the cosh is not the way to survive a trial at Tynecastle, but that's what Murray did when bringing down Braga for Shankland's penalty.In the preamble, Rodgers said that he was including Murray along with Colby Donovan and Jonny Kenny because sometimes youth has no fear. It did here. Murray was exposed and Kenny was a bystander.If you were to forget that Hearts - or any other non-Old Firm club - are not supposed to win the league, you can only conclude that McInnes' side are the real deal and that Rodgers' huff and puff champions are in real trouble.They haven't looked this good since George Burley was in charge two decades ago, that particular Hearts challenge getting snuffed out not by the Old Firm but by the folly of the club's owner at the time, Vlad Romanov.Some might say it's unwise for Hearts folk to dream because it's too early in the campaign. But why not? Isn't football about dreaming of what might be? They've known plenty of misery in these parts in recent times. Telling a Jambo to calm down as their team strides into an eight-point lead at the top of the table is to be the worst kind of killjoy.They have not won the league since 1960. Long road ahead. Danger ahoy, no doubt. Pressure and injury and bumps on the way, but these are exhilarating times.And what might, just might, make it sustainable - is that the infrastructure of the club is everything that Celtic's and Rangers' is not. It's solid. It's focused. It's underpinned by the money and wisdom of Tony Bloom, the Brighton chairman, who has invested £10m for a minority stake in the club.It's underpinned, also, by the work of Jamestown Analytics and their ability to find the likes of Kyziridis, an uncapped Greek who was playing in Slovakia, and Braga, who was operating in the second tier of Norwegian football.The club is now aligned on and off the pitch after many years of being a troubled place. Celtic and Rangers wouldn't mind such stability.People entrenched in Scottish football see things as they have always been and can never see them changing. Perhaps that view will still hold true at the end of the season. Perhaps. The fact there is a considerable doubt is exciting enough for now.People like Bloom, watching here from the stand, are a breath of fresh air. He's already said that Hearts can win the league in a decade. That kind of chat from an underdog is usually laughed off in Scotland. Usually.Tynecastle was alive on Sunday. Another test passed with flying colours. Glorious maroon, of course.",

Police said they were not linking the latest attack to other offences.Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of Walsall Police, said: \"Walsall is a diverse area, and we know the fear and concern that this awful attack will cause in our communities.\"Officers have appealed for witnesses and those with information to get in touch.Related internet links",

    "body": "7 hours agoAleks PhillipsSSGGeorgian security service footage shows armed soldiers detaining three individualsThree Chinese nationals have been arrested in Georgia on suspicion of attempting to illegally purchase 2kg of uranium.Lasha Maghradze, deputy head of the nation's State Security Service (SSG), told a news briefing the group planned to pay $400,000 (£300,570) for the nuclear material in the capital, Tblisi, before transporting it to China via Russia.The alleged plot was unearthed by intelligence agents while one member of the group was attempting to buy the radioactive substance on the black market, he said.The three pleaded not guilty at a court in Tblisi and have been placed in custody to prevent them fleeing the country, according to public broadcaster Georgia Today.They face up to five years in prison under a provision of Georgia's criminal code banning the purchasing of nuclear material.Mr Maghradze told reporters the operation was being co-ordinated by other members of the group in China.SSG footage shows armed soldiers swooping on a car and detaining three individuals.It also shows two glass jars containing a yellow substance in a car boot, which tests identified as uranium. SSGAuthorities found two jars containing uranium in a car bootIt is unclear what isotope of uranium the men are alleged to have sought - though all can emit harmful radiation - and their intended purpose for it.As a former Soviet nation, Georgia had stores of nuclear materials following the bloc's collapse in 1991.The security of those materials has been an ongoing concern, with several serious incidents of uranium being illicitly sold in the years since.In July, the SSG arrested two people - one Georgian and one Turkish national - for attempting to trade $3m worth of uranium.",

    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "Three people have been killed and at least 32 others injured in an overnight Russian air attack on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, the city's mayor has said.Two high-rise residential buildings were hit in the strikes, Vitali Klitschko said, adding in a Telegram post that six children were among the injured.Meanwhile, Russian air defences destroyed two drones heading towards Moscow on Sunday, according to the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin.The latest Russian bombardment comes as Moscow has stepped up attacks on civilian targets and energy infrastructure ahead of winter, with Ukrainian authorities saying nearly 1,200 drones have been launched in the past week alone.Officials in Kyiv said the three people were killed when a drone struck a nine-storey residential building in the Desnianskyi district to the north-west of the city, with 24 others injured in the same attack.Damage was also reported to at least three other residential buildings in Kyiv. Seven people including two children are being treated in hospital, officials said.Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022, and it currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014.There has been marginal movement along the front lines as fighting on the ground continues, while Ukraine has sought to hurt Russia's warfighting ability by striking its military production plants and oil facilities that are essential to its economy.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has recently called on allies to supply his armed forces with long range weapons to continue doing so.However, he came away from a recent meeting at the White House and subsequent EU summit empty-handed.US President Donald Trump did announce new sanctions targeting Russia's largest oil companies this week - the first time he had done so in his current term - as did the EU.Trump said that talks with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin \"don't go anywhere\" as he shelved plans for the two to meet in Budapest over the war in Ukraine.On his way to Asia over the weekend, Trump said he had a \"great relationship\" with Putin but that recent events had been \"disappointing\", suggesting a meeting between the two was conditional on a peace deal being likely. Trump has appeared increasingly frustrated with Russian conditions for bringing the war to a close, with a summit in Alaska in August failing to yield any tangible results.The US president had previously said fresh sanctions on Moscow were contingent on European allies cutting their Russian energy imports. The EU has pledged to do so by 2028.Zelensky has agreed to a US proposal to cease fighting along the current front lines so peace negotiations can begin - though this falls short of Russian demands that Ukrainian forces completely withdraw from the eastern Donbas region.However, senior Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who met US officials in Washington on Friday and Saturday, told CNN that he believed Russia, Ukraine and the US were close to a diplomatic solution to end the war.\"It's a big move by President Zelensky to already acknowledge that it's about battle lines,\" Dmitriev said.\"You know, his previous position was that Russia should leave completely so actually, I think we are reasonably close to a diplomatic solution that can be worked out.\"Meanwhile, Russia said it conducted a test of an experimental nuclear-powered missile on Sunday, which has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterReutersThe US and China have agreed the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when their respective leaders meet later this week, the US treasury secretary has said.Scott Bessent told the BBC's US news partner CBS that this included a \"final deal\" on TikTok's US operations and a deferral on China's tightened rare earth minerals controls.He also said he did not anticipate the 100% tariff on Chinese goods threatened by US President Donald Trump coming into force, while China will resume substantial soybean purchases from the US.Both nations are seeking to avoid further escalation in a trade war between the world's two largest economies.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to hold talks on Thursday in South Korea.Bessent met senior Chinese trade officials on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, which Trump is also attending as part of a tour of Asia. Beijing said they had \"constructive\" discussions.Bessent said the countries had \"reached a substantial framework for the two leaders\", adding: \"The tariffs will be averted.\"The Chinese government said in a statement that both negotiating teams \"reached a basic consensus on arrangements to address their respective concerns\".\"Both sides agreed to further finalise specific details,\" they added.Trump's tariff tacticsSince Trump re-entered the White House, he has imposed and threatened sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas on various countries, arguing that the policy would help boost US manufacturing and jobs. The introduction of tariffs has resulted in many countries, including the UK, agreeing new deals with the US.But the steepest levies he has threatened have been levelled at China. Beijing has hit back with measures of its own, though the two agreed to hold off implementing the levies while pursuing a trade deal.However, earlier this month Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tarriff on Chinese goods from November in response to China tightening restrictions on export of rare earths - materials essential to the production of many electronics. The US president accused Beijing of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".China processes around 90% of the world's rare earths, which go into everything from solar panels to smartphones, making supply of them to US manufacturers a key bargaining chip.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials.China will \"delay that for a year while they re-examine it\", Bessent told a different news show, This Week, on Sunday.Another issue of contention is soybeans, of which China is the world's biggest buyer. As the trade war began heating up, China halted all orders, hurting US farmers.Bessent hinted the boycott may soon be over but refused to give details.\"I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain too... I think we have addressed the farmers' concerns,\" he said on This Week.\"I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public that our soybean farmers will feel really good about what's going on for this season and the coming seasons for several years.\"TikTok deal done?Bessent also said a deal had been agreed on video-sharing platform TikTok's US arm, with Trump and Xi left to \"consummate that transaction on Thursday\".The US has sought to prise the app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security concerns.TikTok was previously told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down, but Trump has delayed implementing the ban four times to facilitate negotiations, and has extended the deadline again to December.The White House announced last month that US companies would control TikTok's algorithm and Americans would hold six of seven board seats for the app's US operations.While Trump initially called for TikTok to be banned during his first term, he has since changed course. He turned to the hugely popular platform to boost his support among young Americans during his successful 2024 presidential campaign.On Sunday, Washington also annouced that trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia had been secured and framworks agreed with Thailand and Vietnam.",

They returned exhausted but delighted. Mission accomplished.\"Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Bravery was found guilty of attempted murder and was jailed in 2020 for at least 15 years.More on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoDamian Zane and Danai Nesta KupembaReutersHundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes because of the ongoing conflictSudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) says it has taken control of the western city of el-Fasher, marking a turning point in the civil war.The group said in a statement on social media that it had seized el-Fasher \"from the grip of mercenaries and militias allied with the terrorist army\".The loss would be a huge blow to the Sudanese army as el-Fasher is its last remaining foothold in the Darfur region, leaving the RSF effectively in control of the area. The army has yet to comment.It comes after the rebel group announced the capture of the army's 6th Division Headquarters, saying that it had destroyed \"huge military vehicles\" and taken military equipment.BBC Verify has confirmed the authenticity of videos circulating on social media that show RSF fighters inside the army base.Local pro-army fighters, the Popular Resistance, accused the RSF of running a \"media disinformation campaign\" to undermine the \"high morale of the forces\".The RSF has surrounded el-Fasher for the last 18 months, with army positions and civilians under frequent bombardment. An estimated 300,000 people have been trapped by the fighting.Medics under siege: 'We feared this photo would be our last'A simple guide to the war in SudanIn August, satellite imagery showed a series of extensive earthen walls being constructed around the city, aimed at trapping people inside.The RSF have been steadily advancing towards the 6th Infantry Division command - widely regarded as the army headquarters in the city - from several directions for weeks. There are still some parts of el-Fasher under the control of the army and allied armed groups - but those are not expected to hold out for long now. Hunger and disease has spread across the city as residents contend with constant bombardment and dwindling food and medical supplies.UN investigators have accused the RSF of committing numerous crimes against humanity during the siege. The US has said the RSF has committed genocide against Darfur's non-Arab population.Sudan has been ravished by conflict since 2023, after top commanders of the RSF and Sudanese army fell out and a vicious power struggle ensued. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises.The army controls most of the north and the east, with el-Fasher being until now the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies.The RSF controls almost all of Darfur and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region.The group has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in al-Fasher when it assumes complete control.Additional reporting by Peter MwaiMore BBC Africa stories:Inside Khartoum, a city left in ruins after two years of war'Our children are dying': Rare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan cityA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zone: 'I prayed the baby wouldn't come'Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "7 hours agoNaomi Clarke,BBC News NI and Ross McKee,BBC News NIPA MediaThe independent TD secured a record number of first preference votesIrish President Michael D Higgins has congratulated his successor Catherine Connolly after her landslide election win.The independent TD (member of Irish parliament) secured 914,143 first preference votes (63%) - a record in Irish presidential election history.However, politicians have said the unprecedented number of 213,738 spoiled votes needs to be addressed. Connolly was officially declared as the elected 10th president of the Republic of Ireland on Saturday evening at Dublin Castle, after defeating Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys.Following her win, Higgins said he rang Connolly to congratulate her \"on what is a momentous day for her and her family\".The current Irish president, who has served the maximum two terms in office, added that Connolly will have the \"full support\" of his office ahead of her inauguration on 11 November.Spoiled votes a 'clear message'When spoilt votes were excluded, Humphreys won 29% of first preference votes, while Fianna Fail's Jim Gavin, who withdrew from the race but remained on the ballot paper, won 7% first preference votes.BBC NI's Dublin correspondent, Gabija Gataveckaite, said the nearly 13% of voters who spoiled their ballot paper will \"send a very clear message to government\" that people were \"not happy that they did not have a wide range of choice\".The last time the Irish presidential election was a two-horse race was back in 1973. To secure a place on the ballot paper, a candidate must be endorsed by at least 20 members of the Irish Parliament, known as the Oireachtas, or if they are nominated by four out of Ireland's 31 local authorities.Gataveckaite said there could be \"space\" for the government to consider how to approach future elections. Tánaiste (Ireland's deputy prime minister) Simon Harris acknowledged the high level of spoiled ballots on Saturday, saying he saw \"people going to quite a lot of effort to spoil their ballot\".He added that the government needed to do \"some soul searching\" following the 46% turnout. ReutersIndependent TD Catherine Connolly defeated Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys to secure the presidential win'A win for politics' Connolly, from Galway, who has been a TD since 2016, was backed by the major left-wing parties – Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit, and the Greens.Speaking to BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said the result of the presidential election had boosted her confidence of leading a left-wing coalition into government in the Republic of Ireland after the next general election.\"I think we need to work in common cause, in a collaborative way, to find means and mechanisms to repeat this moment of hope,\" she added.\"This moment of real evidence of success and achievement and a win for politics beyond Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.\"During the election campaign, Connolly sought to establish herself as a united Ireland candidate and said she would like to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her presidency, which runs for seven years.McDonald said she expected to see a border poll during Connolly's presidency and was \"so happy\" that Ireland had a president who \"appreciates and recognises that the preparations for those referendums needs to happen now\".\"I believe that Catherine's presidency is the time where we will see the calling of the referendums, I have said for many, many reasons, the extent of change, political change, demographic change, all across Ireland,\" she said.",

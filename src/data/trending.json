The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "1 hour agoPA MediaRupert Lowe was elected as Reform UK MP for Great Yarmouth in July 2024 but now sits as an independentA former Reform UK MP, who is now serving as an independent, has launched a new political party.Rupert Lowe, who represents Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, launched Restore Britain, which he said would be a \"national political party\", on Friday night.He initially set up Restore Britain as a \"political movement\" after he was suspended from Reform UK last March.It is now expected to act as an umbrella political party, with locally based political parties as partners.Lowe, a businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, is expected to stand again for the Great Yarmouth constituency with local party Great Yarmouth First, which will be a partner of Restore Britain.Senior Conservative figures Susan Hall and Sir Gavin Williamson had been involved in an advisory board for Restore Britain when it was described as a political movement.Former minister Sir Gavin suggested to the Press Association he would end his involvement with Restore Britain as a result of it becoming a political party.Hall, the Tory leader in the London Assembly, is also understood to be leaving Restore Britain's board.The BBC's East of England political editor, Andrew Sinclair, said Lowe had a reputation for being a bit of a \"maverick MP\". \"He's not very collegiate, which was one reason why he left Reform UK,\" he said.\"He also believes, more than many, that there is a real disconnect between mainstream politicians and the public - and he points to his Great Yarmouth constituency as proof that he is right.\"There haven't been any elections in the town since he left Reform but anecdotally he seems to have a lot of support. I have been shown private polling by both Labour and his own people which suggest that he would do well if an election was held now.\"He believes that in a crowded marketplace there is room for another party, on the right, which will pride itself on its independence of mind. \"He had hoped his local creation Great Yarmouth First would make its mark in this year's local elections, but they have been cancelled. This new party will aim to pick up national support.\"More related stories",

Authorities believe she was taken against her will.In a social media post, the sheriff's department said \"law enforcement activity\" was ongoing \"related to the Guthrie case\" without providing further details.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told local media outlet KOLD that investigators were \"actively working a lead\", the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, both marked and unmarked, have been seen in the area by BBC News, including Swat teams and forensics.Investigators have also found several gloves, with the closest discovered about two miles from Nancy Guthrie's home.The sheriff's department said reports that a glove was found inside her home or on the property are inaccurate. All collected evidence has been sent for laboratory analysis, they added.It said investigators had been able to establish identifying details about the suspect after analysing footage from a doorbell camera outside Guthrie's home.Getty ImagesUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her mother NancyThe suspect was wearing a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack in the footage, the FBI said. After the doorbell footage was released, investigators received more than 13,000 tips, including 4,000 in the 24 hours.The FBI has also increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.The county sheriff department said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", adding: \"However, investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities.\" Investigators have also issued a wider appeal for video footage from Guthrie's neighbours.Police have said Nancy Guthrie, 84, needs daily medication and has limited mobility.Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's abductor.They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her safe return.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's home",

I'd play some of it here, but it's not royalty-free.\"He also quipped: \"I've compiled everyone who works at my local takeaway pizza place into a book. It's my Domino's Who's Who.\"Another gag went: \"Only women can use the herbal dumbbells. Thyme weights for no man.\"'Always loved comedy'Pickard said he thought winning the award was a \"very elaborate prank\". \"I'm very overwhelmed,\" he said. \"It's the biggest gig I've ever done and I'm very pleased that there is a competition for something that I'm good at.\"It's a skill I've always liked, rushing puns. It's something I've always been good at.\"I've always loved comedy.

You get a lot of very interesting shows here,\" he said. \"I really wish I could have stayed longer than I did.\"The festival, now in its 33rd year, comprises 700 shows across 76 venues in Leicester and Leicestershire.It features known comedians including actor and writer Sir Stephen Fry and Sue Perkins, and up-and-coming talent.Michael Harris-Wakelam, chief executive of Big Difference Company - the charity behind the festival - said: \"The skill on display this year was outstanding. \"This event is a flagship of our festivals programme and celebrates and champions the art involved in great word play. \"Congratulations to all involved and to our worthy winner.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "34 minutes agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentReutersThe US Secretary of State said America and Europe's destiny were closely linked during a closely watched address in MunichWorld leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have been gathering in Munich for Europe's biggest security and defence conference. The burning question on everyone's minds: is America still an ally of Europe?The keynote speech that everyone was waiting for was from Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State. Would he repeat the attacks made on Europe last year by the US Vice President JD Vance? Or would he be conciliatory?The hall was packed to the rafters. Generals and admirals, bemedalled in their uniforms, prime ministers and presidents, diplomats, ambassadors, US Congressmen and women, European politicians and their SPADs - all waiting nervously to hear what President Donald Trump's top diplomat had to say.The applause did not come straight away. In fact, for the first few minutes, as Rubio got into his stride, it began to sound very much like a repeat attack on Europe. Free trade, mass migration, green policies on climate change – all came in for sharp criticism. World leaders gather in Munich for high-level security talks - follow liveHe even talked about \"a climate cult\" that was harming America's economy, while he went on to slam the United Nations, saying it had failed to resolve the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. The US Secretary of State, impeccably neat and groomed, stood with one hand casually in his trouser pocket, delivering this from a prepared script at a podium.But then he spoke the words everyone in the room wanted to hear: \"Our destiny will always be intertwined with yours (in Europe).\"\"The end of the transatlantic era,\" he went on to say, \"is neither our goal nor our wish... we will always be a child of Europe\".Rubio spoke of \"unshackling creativity\", of shared goals in securing supply chains for critical minerals, and of the European culture he so admired, a continent that had given the world Shakespeare, Mozart and the Rolling Stones (he got a muffled laugh for that). But there was a sting in the tail. What we have together, he said, was unique and \"we in the US have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline\".So what did people make of this? It was broadly positive – about half the audience stood up at the end to applaud him. There was certainly a palpable sense of relief that after all the upsets of the last few months, with tariffs and the threat of a US grab for Greenland, the transatlantic alliance was not dead.\"It was a good speech,\" Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told me afterwards. \"I think the Europeans sighed with relief because it was saying that Europe is important, that Europe and America are very intertwined and good allies, and have been for so long and will be in the future.\"She did not deny, though, that there remain real differences in policy in some areas between Washington and Europe. And while both sides agree that Europe needs to shoulder much more of the burden for its own defence, I have encountered some quiet exasperation here in Munich at Trump's refusal to put enough pressure on Russia to end the Ukraine war, that is poised to enter its fifth, bloody year.",

    "body": "12 hours agoMadeline HalpertandSakshi VenkatramanGetty ImagesJames Van Der Beek kept working after being diagnosed with cancerActor James Van Der Beek seemed to be everywhere in the 1990s and 2000s. With the title role in coming-of-age teen drama Dawson's Creek, he walked some of the industry's hottest red carpets, and his face plastered magazine covers - one even dubbing him a \"new superstar\".But when tragedy struck later in life, his family needed to rely on the kindness of his friends - and fans - for financial help, shedding light on the precarious financial situation of not just many actors, no matter how famous, but millions of everyday Americans struggling with medical bills.Van Der Beek - who had six children with his wife - died on Wednesday at the age of 48 after being diagnosed with colorectal cancer three years ago.The cost of his medical treatments were so financially draining, his wife says, that she has now made a public plea for donations so they would not lose their home. They have raised $2.3m (£1.7m) thus far.Getty ImagesJames Van Der Beek auctioned off the shirt he wore in this promotional stillIn the months before his death, Van Der Beek had shared how cash-strapped the cancer treatments had left him and his family. He even publicly auctioned off items he'd saved for decades from the roles that defined his career - a plaid buttoned shirt he wore in the first episode of Dawson's Creek, a necklace he gifted to Katie Holmes' character on the teen drama series and sports shoes he wore when he starred in the 1999 film Varsity Blues.\"I've been storing these treasures for years, waiting for the right time to do something with them, and with all of the recent unexpected twists and turns life has presented recently, it's clear that the time is now,\" Van Der Beek told People Magazine last November.On top of the costly treatments, Van Der Beek was not making the same cash that he'd seen in the prime of his career decades ago. He had said he was paid \"almost nothing\" for Dawson's Creek and his contract didn't include residuals - payments writers, actors and directors receive when their work is re-aired on television. Actors on other still-popular shows from that same period, like Friends, are said to make about $20m annually from such payments.\"There was no residual money,\" Van Der Beek told Today in 2012.  \"I was 20.  It was a bad contract. I saw almost nothing from that.\"He continued working after his diagnosis, appearing in two episodes of the television show Overcompensating in 2025, but it's unclear whether that was enough to qualify him for health insurance from the prominent actors' union in Hollywood. Actors can qualify for health insurance through SAG-AFTRA only if they work 108 days a year or earn at least $28,090 on union shoots. The BBC has contacted the union.Van Der Beek is not the first high-profile American actor to highlight the issue. Beverly Hills 90210 star Shannen Doherty, who died in 2024, said she did not have insurance when she was first diagnosed with breast cancer.Getty ImagesVan Der Beek and his Dawson's Creek co-stars pictured in 1997Benjamin Byron Davis, 53, an actor who has appeared on television shows as well as in movies like Marvel's Ant Man, told the BBC that decreased residuals have become a problem for actors across the board.\"Revenue streams that actors have depended upon have disappeared,\" he said, noting that the rise of streaming has affected how production companies compensate performers. He said many actors depend on these payments both for income and to qualify for health insurance through their union SAG-AFTRA. \"I work when I'm hired and I survive when I'm not.\"Davis said he lost his health insurance during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strikes. \"There wasn't work,\" he said, adding that he ended up getting it back when the strikes were over and he was able to meet the qualifications again.Davis said that just 10 years ago, the union's minimum earnings for health insurance was a third of what it is now, at a level today that is out of reach for the vast majority of actors.Those who are covered by the union plan get good health coverage, said Valerie Yaros, an archivist with SAG-AFTRA.But it was possible Van Der Beek no longer received the union plan because of his fewer work hours, she added.In 2024, Van Der Beek told People that it had become a \"full-time job\" dealing with cancer treatment appointments and his insurance.A heated debate on health insuranceHis death put a new celebrity face on the debate about rising healthcare costs in the US - an issue that Republicans and Democrats have long recognised needs reform but have disagreed on the best ways to resolve the problem.The US has one of the most expensive health systems in the world, with spending on health care estimated to reach $5.9tn in 2026, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.About 100 million people in the US are estimated to struggle to pay off their medical and dental healthcare debt, according to recent data.The GoFundMe page posted online on Wednesday solicited donations to assist Van Der Beek's widow Kimberley and their six children, whose ages range from 4 to 15.His wife shared the page, which noted the \"significant financial strain\" the family had seen as they \"did everything possible to support James and provide for his care\".\"In the wake of this loss, Kimberly and the children are facing an uncertain future. The costs of James's medical care and the extended fight against cancer have left the family out of funds,\" the page reads. \"They are working hard to stay in their home and to ensure the children can continue their education and maintain some stability during this incredibly difficult time.\"Even with health insurance, cancer treatment can prove extremely costly for those in the US. Some studies suggest the average monthly cost of chemotherapy can range from $1,000 to $12,000.This is because in the US private health-care system, even those with insurance can face high deductibles and thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs, said Eva Stahl, the vice president of policy at Undue Medical Debt, a nonprofit that has paid off about $25bn of medical debt for almost 15 million people.\"People simply can't afford vital, life-saving treatments without going into debt,\" she said. \"When even someone with James Van Der Beek's resources has no option but to fundraise for treatment, it's clear how fundamentally unfair our healthcare system is.\"Michael Short, a graphic artist in Tennessee who has had his own battles with medical debt, told the BBC that his sister has had to declare bankruptcy because of medical debt for treatments for her endometrial and another cancer, even with insurance coverage.\"It's in the hundreds of thousands if not millions for these cancer treatments,\" he said. \"The prices on these medications and on these treatments are just so high.\"More weekend picks",

The Beckhams have yet to formally respond.One of the most explosive claims Brooklyn made is that Lady Beckham \"hijacked\" the first dance at his wedding, which - he says - had been planned \"weeks in advance\" to a romantic love song.\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life,\" he said.A report from British Vogue, who were at the wedding, said: \"Brooklyn invited his mother on stage for a dance and they were joined by David and their 10-year-old daughter, Harper.\"In his interview with the Sun, Ramsay, who was at the wedding, insisted nothing \"salacious\" or \"inappropriate\" took place.Ramsay said \"the relationship with David and Brooklyn is very, very deep and I know how much David loves Brooklyn\".\"I think it's only going to be a matter of time before Brooklyn takes a good look at himself,\" the chef said.He added: \"It's easy to get up on that roller coaster and get carried away, but it will come back\". Asked if he had spoken to Brooklyn, Ramsay said they had messaged \"a little bit\" and that he \"loves him\".\"He's desperate to stand on his own two feet,\" Ramsay said, but he urged Brooklyn to remember \"one day you're not going to have your Mum and Dad\".Ramsay was speaking to the Sun ahead of the release of his new Netflix documentary Being Gordon Ramsay.Sir David has not directly discussed the fall out, but speaking generally about social media in January, he said children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

The Queen told Ms Pelicot that she had \"inspired women across the globe\" and \"created a powerful legacy that will change the narrative around shame, forever\".Gisèle Pelicot waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial to make the \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist. She became a global figurehead of strength and feminism, and during the 15-week trial in Avignon, supporters stood outside the court every day with signs thanking Ms Pelicot for her courage, and calling for justice.\"It was an honour for me to receive this letter, I wasn't expecting it at all,\" Ms Pelicot, 73, told Victoria Derbyshire for BBC Newsnight.\"I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter.\"The Queen is a long-standing campaigner on domestic and sexual violence and has worked with organisations that support survivors for years.\"Thank you for all that you have done,\" she wrote to Ms Pelicot. \"You are very much in my thoughts and prayers, and I hope that you will now be able to rest and recover from this devastating ordeal.\"CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFP via Getty ImagesCrowds of  supporters greeted Pelicot outside the Avignon courthouse every day of the trialIt is the first time the contents of the letter have been revealed. But with the Queen and Ms Pelicot's permission, it was shared with the BBC during Ms Pelicot's interview with Newsnight ahead of the release of her memoir: A Hymn To Life.Ms Pelicot said she was surprised and felt \"very honoured\" when she received the note, \"because although my words touched the whole world, I wasn't expecting a letter from the Court of England\". \"I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.\"",

The pair had initially tried to ski in Val d'Isère, but found the slopes too crowded and decided to go for a walk.\"I was watching people free riding and skiing off-piste, and thought it looks very dangerous,\" said Martignon. \"In 20 seconds there was an avalanche, it went down and took people below.\"Val d'Isère has already experienced avalanches this winter, with one person dying in the resort of Tignes nearby last month.France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with \"very unstable snow cover\".The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.\"We have had some very complicated, very unstable snow since the beginning of the season,\" Luc Nicolino, slopes manager at La Plagne, told AFP.\"It's a kind of mille-feuille with many hidden, fragile layers.\"You can also get in touch the following ways:Email: yourvoice@bbc.co.ukWhatsApp: +44 7756 165803",

    "body": "4 days agoHelen BurchellSteve ForemanThe juvenile loggerhead turtle was found washed up on a Suffolk beachA rare loggerhead turtle - a species not native to UK waters - has been rescued after being found near-dead on a Suffolk beach after being washed ashore in stormy weather.Steve Foreman was walking on Dunwich beach when he spotted the ailing turtle, which he initially thought was \"just some debris\".He carried the creature back to his campsite and called in specialist volunteers from  British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR), who assessed the creature.BDMLR said it was then transferred to Hunstanton Sea Life in Norfolk, which has been contacted for comment. Foreman, from Cambridge, who was on a short break with his wife Sue, found the turtle on the beach on Thursday.\"It had been really stormy, and there was a lot of debris washed up, but as I got closer I realised this was a turtle - but it looked very dead,\" he said.\"I picked it up and thought I saw a movement in one flipper, so I carried it back to the campsite\".They searched online for what to do and were pointed towards BDMLR, whose volunteers arrived within about 20 minutes.\"They assessed it and weighed it, and then it was taken to the sea life centre in Hunstanton,\" he said.Getty ImagesLoggerheads are fairly common in the Meditteranean, like this one, off the coast of GreeceA BDMLR spokesperson said while loggerheads were rare in UK waters and did not belong here, the organisation was seeing more.So far this year, it has been called out to rescues in the Channel Islands, Wales, Scotland, Dorset and Kent, \"but I think we've only ever had one or two in Suffolk\", they said.\"Sea temperatures are rising, and they get washed up here in storms, usually suffering from cold shock or being 'cold-stunned', so they can't move, and some people think they are dead,\" they continued. \"The people who found this loggerhead did exactly the right thing - some people try to put them back in the water, but that is the worst thing for them - we'd encourage anyone who finds one to call us, and we can get it to the experts.\"Steve ForemanThe rescued turtle was taken back to a campsiteThe spokesperson said not all sea life centres were experienced or had the facilities to rehabilitate loggerhead turtles - but Hunstanton was one of them.It can take up to a year before they are deemed fit for release back into warmer waters.Foreman said he and his wife were keeping their fingers crossed for the \"stunning little creature\" they had found and that its turtle power would prevail and bring it out of its shell.They nicknamed it Steve, although initial examination by BDMLR suggested it may be a juvenile female.\"We might have to refer to her as Stevie, then,\" Foreman added.You may also be interested inRelated internet links",

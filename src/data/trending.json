    "body": "Manchester United are still evaluating the full extent of the injury captain Bruno Fernandes sustained during the 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa.Manager Ruben Amorim thinks the midfielder is set for a spell on the sidelines - but will be hoping the damage is not too bad. Fernandes pulled up at the end of the first half and felt his hamstring, before continuing and coming off at the break.Any absence would be particularly notable given the Portuguese playmaker's remarkable availability record since joining from Sporting in January 2020.From his debut in a goalless draw against Wolves to the Villa defeat, United have played 221 Premier League games - and Fernandes has featured in 212, including 208 starts.Of the nine matches Fernandes has missed, two were because he was rested ahead of key European matches, including last season's defeat at Brentford in May. Four were because of suspension - so just three have been a result of injury or illness. His longest absence was two games in a row at the end of the 2023-24 campaign, but he still recovered before the FA Cup final victory over Manchester City.The bad news for Amorim is United have lost the past four league games Fernandes has missed and five of the past six.While we still do not know how long Fernandes will be out, here are United's next seven games:26 December (20:00 GMT) v Newcastle (h)30 December (20:15 GMT) v Wolves (h)4 January (12:30 GMT) v Leeds (a)7 January (20:15 GMT) v Burnley (a)11 January (1630 GMT) v Brighton (h) - FA Cup third round17 January (12:30 GMT) v Man City (h)25 January (16:30 GMT) v Arsenal (a)So what are Amorim's options if his talisman is ruled out?Amorim has stressed all season Mainoo is in direct competition with Fernandes as they are most similar in styles. In theory, this is the chance for the 20-year-old to show his manager he has been wrong to leave him out so often. However, Amorim said Mainoo missed the defeat at Villa with a calf problem and was unlikely to be fit to face Newcastle. Conspiracy theorists had suggested Mainoo was left out as a result of the \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" T-shirt his half-brother wore during the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.Yet this course of action would be to ignore Amorim's admission his own brother did something similar during his own career, which led to him having to apologise and distance himself from what had happened. Amorim has not said how long Mainoo will be out for.On the assumption veteran Brazil midfielder Casemiro, 33, will return from suspension against Newcastle, there is a chance Manuel Ugarte will partner him. Yet, like Mainoo and Fernandes, Ugarte and Casemiro have tended to compete for the same position. The last time the pair started together in the league was last season in a 0-0 draw against Manchester City in April. There is also an unhappy statistic to consider United have not won any of the past nine league games in which Uruguay midfielder Ugarte has started - a record beaten at the club only by Brazilian Kleberson. Lisandro Martinez replaced Fernandes at half-time at Villa Park. Primarily a defender, Amorim previously said he would only consider Martinez as a midfield option \"in an emergency\".This situation probably meets the criteria, and Martinez was arguably Amorim's most effective performer at Villa Park. Still, neither Ugarte nor Martinez have the creative qualities that would ideally fit in alongside Casemiro.When Mount arrived from Chelsea, Erik ten Hag felt he could operate as a number eight. Mount can create and playing him alongside Casemiro could offer Joshua Zirkzee a chance to fit in as a number 10. Amorim feels Mount is better in the number 10 role but, as with Martinez, needs must in an emergency. The England man has also played at wing-back, so the United head coach clearly admires his flexibility. The other key element is Mount is in form, having scored against Crystal Palace and Wolves recently.Fletcher made his debut at Villa Park and has the attributes Amorim needs. Like his dad Darren - the former United and Scotland midfielder - Fletcher has lots of energy. He also has a good passing range and has made big strides over the past few months. However, it would be asking a lot to put the 18-year-old England youth international into the cauldron of a Premier League game from the start.Since Amorim's arrival, he has attempted to get United playing his specific system, rarely straying away from his philosophy.By taking a system-first approach, Amorim looks for specific qualities from his players in each position, asking them to adapt to what he wants, rather than altering his system to fit the players at his disposal.Looking at his system and what he wants from his midfielders may help explain how he navigates the next few months.Amorim opts for a 3-2-4-1 shape that does not rely on having the majority of the ball.At the start of his tenure, Amorim looked to build-up short, but to his credit has opted to play long from the keeper more often - which suits the players he has. This requires players able to cover distance and win second balls.His side are asked to carry out passing routines too with patterns of play often ending in United's midfielders playing through-balls over the top for attackers running in behind.The midfield duo therefore need to be able to carry out these instructions.Amorim's preferred midfield duo of Casemiro and Fernandes provides clues to what he asks from his midfielders.Casemiro's role is more positionally strict - screening the defence, breaking up play and getting up and down the pitch to close the distance between defence and attack when the ball is played long.Fernandes is given licence to contribute in attack but, like Casemiro, has the ability to run hard up and down the pitch, getting back to defend when needed.Both players have a tendency to play direct passes into attackers running in behind whilst taking few touches in midfield - qualities that fit Amorim's tactical plan.The other midfield options must therefore fit into either Casemiro or Fernandes' roles, with Ugarte being the most likely back-up to Casemiro while Mount, Martinez and Mainoo possess some of the quality to do Fernandes' job.Given the constraints around the Africa Cup of Nations and United's injuries, the other option is for Amorim to tweak his system. This is not something he has done yet at Old Trafford, but - when asked about a shortage of wing-backs - he hinted he could, depending \"on the way we play in that particular week, if we have to change for a back four, we change for a back four\".The shortage of midfielders could force his hand in the same way.If United are to move to four at the back, with three in midfield, the obvious player to benefit would be Mainoo. The England man has struggled to displace either Casemiro or Fernandes given the specific tactical demands Amorim asks for in this system. And the United boss believes Mainoo's strengths and weaknesses are more suited to a midfield three.\"The problem is that we are playing with two [midfielders] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way to what I am seeing,\" he said.\"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two. But with three, Kobbie will have more minutes.\"",

    "body": "Spain's Christmas lottery has been welcomed as an \"injection of hope\" in the northwest of the country, where the jackpot handed out hundreds of millions of euros just months after wildfires had caused devastation.Most of the first-prize-winning tickets in the lottery, known as El Gordo, had been bought by people in small towns in the province of León. A single ticket, or décimo, costing €20 (£17), is worth €400,000 (£349,484) if it bears the winning number, in this case 79432. Décimos come in strips of 10 and when many strips of the same number are sold to a group of neighbours or workmates, there is potential for a massive jackpot.People in the town of La Bañeza shared out €468m (£409m). Among the recipients were members of a local football club in the town, which has a population of around 11,000.The jackpot came four months after forest fires had torn through León, burning 8,000 hectares (31 sq miles) of land surrounding La Bañeza and killing a local man, 35-year-old Abel Ramos. The sparsely populated, heavily forested north-west of Spain is used to wildfires, although during this record-breaking year, the area was particularly severely affected. Firefighters battled enormous blazes in León and the neighbouring Galicia region throughout much of August and during the summer 0.8 percent of the country's total surface area was burned.According to the mayor of the town, Javier Carrera, the lottery win \"means for La Bañeza an injection of excitement and hope,\" he told Spanish media. Carrera also mentioned the closure this year of a local sugar-beet factory which caused the loss of dozens of jobs.Another town in the León province that was heavily affected by the summer's fires, Villablino, also took a massive share of the jackpot, receiving €200 million (£175m).\"We needed some good news,\" said the mayor, Mario Rivas.On top of the blazes, five local men were killed in two separate mining accidents in nearby Asturias this year.\"It doesn't make up for the loss of the lives of our friends, but this shows us that there can also be good news,\" said Rivas.Most of the winning tickets in Villablino were sold by a local Alzheimer's association.In addition, the town of La Pola de Gordón, also in León and with a population of 3,000, shared out 60 million euros. Sixty-four million euros of jackpot money also went to a working-class district in Madrid.In Villablino, Maribel Martín had one of the winning décimos, worth €400,000 (£349,484). She was out doing grocery shopping when her son called her to give her the good news.\"We were really down and 200 million euros is a wonderful thing,\" she saidShe is clear what she wants to do with the prize money. \"Spread it around a bit and enjoy life,\" she said.",

    "body": "Chris Rea: The car enthusiast whose love of driving inspired his songs10 hours agoEmma PetrieGetty ImagesChris Rea: \"Most of the songs are different people's love stories inside cars\"Rock and blues singer Chris Rea spent countless hours on the road, and his love of cars and driving was the inspiration behind many of his songs. He recorded 25 solo albums, two of which topped the UK albums chart. His distinctive gravelly voice and slide guitar-playing are preserved in songs such as Road to Hell, Auberge, On the Beach and Driving Home for Christmas.Christopher Anton Rea was born in Middlesbrough in the north-east of England in 1951 to an Italian father and Irish mother and was one of seven children. The family was known locally for Camillo's Ice cream factory and cafes, owned by his father Camillo Rea.Driving Home for Christmas singer Chris Rea dies aged 74Chris worked in the cafes as a teenager and took his driving test in one of his dad's ice cream vans. When he was asked to do an emergency stop, the examiner fell off the box he was sitting on and cut his leg. Rea said: \"I had to take him to the hospital but he still passed me.\"He was still working for his father when he bought his first guitar, a 1961 Hofner V3 in his early 20s.Rea said that at the time he was \"meant to be developing my father's ice cream cafe into a global concern, but I spent all my time in the stockroom playing slide guitar\".Getty ImagesChris Rea: \"The road always becomes a metaphor for where we are going in life.\"He played with local groups The Elastic Band, and Magdalene, but it was The Beautiful Losers which shone the spotlight on Rea, and he secured a solo recording deal with Magnet Records.His first studio album was Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?, released in 1978. The lead single, Fool (If You Think It's Over), was a big hit in the US, reaching number one on the (adult) contemporary singles Billboard chart, earning him a best new artist  nomination at the Grammy Awards.Michael Levey, co-founder of Magnet records, remembers him as \"more of a thoughtful, introspective poet than a natural pop performer\".One of Rea's childhood dreams had been to write and compose music for films. He achieved both with his movie La Passione in 1996. Rea also wrote the score and title track for the Soft Top Hard Shoulder film and starred in the comedy Parting Shots in 1999.Getty Images\"Music and cars fit together very well\" Rea explainedRea was building a reputation for his slide guitar playing when his record company insisted on releasing Driving Home for Christmas in 1986. He said: \"I didn't need a Christmas song hanging around at that point. I did everything I could to get them not to release that record. Thankfully they did!\"The song's inspiration dates back to a difficult year for him personally.  In 1978 Rea had come to the end of his record contract and had parted ways with his manager. The record company wouldn't pay for a train ticket for him to get from London to his home to Middlesbrough so his wife drove down to pick him up in her old Austin Mini.On the way back up, it started snowing and they kept getting stuck in traffic and Rea said: \"I'd look across at the other drivers, who all looked so miserable. \"Jokingly, I started singing - We're driving home for Christmas... then, whenever the street lights shone inside the car, I started writing down the lyrics.\"Getty ImagesRea began learning to play guitar at the age of 21\"It's one of those moments that songwriters get - sometimes you can spend years and years writing. That one was five to 10 minutes. When you have a successful song, you don't remember thinking about it - it just comes out.\"He didn't sing the song live until December 2014 after his crew badgered him to do it. He hired 12 snow cannons and let them off during the song.\"We put three feet of artificial snow in the stalls. The venue charged me £12,000 to clean it up!\"Getty ImagesRea released his first solo album in 1978Bad traffic on the intersection between the M4 and the M25 was also the inspiration for Road to Hell.Rea's musical journey was brought to a temporary stop when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer aged 33.He had a procedure which resulted in the removal of part of his pancreas, the duodenum, the gall bladder and part of his liver. He was also a type 1 diabetic and had problems with his kidney.His health problems made him reassess his career - he never toured America despite his popularity.  \"I was never a rock star or pop star and all the illness has been my chance to do what I'd always wanted to do with music,\" he said.In 1997, that included recording Let's Dance with his good friend Bob Mortimer for Middlesbrough Football Cub's FA Cup Final. In one of Mortimer's appearances on the BBC's comedy series Would I Lie to You, Mortimer claimed that Rea cracked an egg into a bath for him after they'd finished recording it at his studio. The clip about whether that was a truth or lie went viral.Rea was happy to admit that he was a vehicle addict with a huge love of cars, and travelling in them helped inspire some of his music. He owned and raced various vintage cars including a 1957 Morris Minor 1000 police car. He was friends with Eddie Jordan, owner of the Jordan Formula 1 team, and once helped out in the pit lane.\"I had the whole uniform. He put me in charge of the tyre-warmer for the rear right tyre of Eddie Irvine's car\".Getty ImagesRea on his European tour of Road Songs For Lovers in 2017In 2016 he suffered a stroke, but still recovered enough to record and tour his 24th album: Road Songs for Lovers.Rea said he spent an awful lot of time on the road travelling to London.  \"I see couples in cars - are they married, workmates, having an affair?\" he mused.The musician liked to write about the simple things in life: \"You get ideas for songs and you're actually on a road - the road always becomes a metaphor for where we're going in life,\" he once said.",

    "body": "Singer-songwriter Barry Manilow has revealed he will undergo surgery to remove a cancerous spot on his lung.Manilow, one of the biggest stars of the 1970s and 80s, said it was \"pure luck\" that doctors found the spot early when he had an MRI following weeks of bronchitis.The 82-year-old, known for a string of hits including Copacabana, Could It Be Magic and Mandy, said doctors do not believe it has spread and he will not need chemotherapy or radiation.In a statement on Instagram, he said: \"As many of you know I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks.\"Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK.\"The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed.\"It's pure luck (and a great doctor) that it was found so early. That's the good news.\"He went on to say the \"bad news\" is that after finishing his latest run of concerts, he is \"going into surgery to have the spot removed\".\"The doctors do not believe it has spread and I'm taking tests to confirm their diagnosis.\"So that's it. No chemo. No radiation. Just chicken soup and I Love Lucy reruns.\"He issued a reminder to people that \"if you have even the slightest symptom\" to get tested.Manilow said he will need a month to recover and his arena concerts planned for January will be rescheduled.He said he was \"counting down the days\" until he can return to performing.",

    "body": "Russia has intensified its strikes on the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa, causing widespread power cuts and threatening the region's maritime infrastructure.Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Moscow was carrying out \"systematic\" attacks on the region. Last week, he warned that the focus of the war \"may have shifted towards Odesa\".President Volodymyr Zelensky said the repeated attacks were an attempt by Moscow to block Ukraine's access to maritime logistics. Earlier in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the sea as retaliation for drone attacks on tankers of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea.\"Shadow fleet\" is a term that refers to hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.On Monday evening, strikes hit port infrastructure in Odesa, damaging a civilian vessel, the regional governor said.It was the latest in a series of hundreds of strikes which have disrupted power supplies in the region for days on end and caused several casualties. On Sunday night, strikes cut off electricity for 120,000 people and sparked a fire at a major port which destroyed dozens of containers of flour and vegetable oil.Last week, a ballistic missile strike on the Pivdenniy port east of Odesa killed eight people and injured at least 30.Another attack earlier in the week killed a woman who was travelling in a car with her three children and temporarily cut off the Odesa region's only bridge linking Ukraine and Moldova.Zelensky indicated a new commander of the air force for the region would be selected soon following the dismissal of Dmytro Karpenko over the weekend.Odesa's port has always been key for the country's economy. The city is Ukraine's third largest after Kyiv and Kharkiv. It now occupies strategic importance as other ports in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolayiv regions are inaccessible to Ukraine due to Russian occupation.Despite the war, Ukraine remains one of the world's top exporters of wheat and corn. Since August 2023, Odesa has been the starting point of a crucial corridor that allows it to export grain out of the country, following the coastlines of Romania and Bulgaria before reaching Turkey.Zelensky, who has previously accused Russia of \"sowing chaos\" on the people of Odesa, said that \"everyone must see that without pressure on Russia, they have no intention of genuinely ending their aggression\".His comments came as the latest round of US-led diplomatic efforts wrapped up in Miami. The US separately met the Ukrainian and Russian delegations, with the meetings yielding optimistic statements but no clear progress to bring the end of Moscow's nearly four-year war on Ukraine any closer.US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he and his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov had worked on \"aligning positions\" on a 20-point draft peace plan put forward by Ukraine earlier this month. The plan is an alternative to a proposal presented by the US in November, which was seen as favourable to Moscow.Before Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev even returned to Moscow from Florida, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters that the European and Ukrainian changes to the peace proposal would not improve the chances of peace being achieved.On Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused EU countries of having a \"firm aspiration\" to derail potential Russia-US agreements on Ukraine and to \"in general prevent Russia-American relations getting healthier\".He also said European countries were \"possessed by a maniacal\" fear of a Russian attack. Russia was ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it had no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato, Ryabkov added, echoing previous comments from Putin. \"We've never planned to [attack Europe], but if they want to hear it from us, well, let's do it, we'll put it in writing,\" Putin said in November.",

    "body": "Vince Zampella, who co-created the widely-popular video game series Call of Duty, has died in a car crash in California, aged 55. Zampella's death was confirmed by Electronic Arts, which owns Respawn Entertainment, a game studio he co-founded.The influential video game developer was travelling in a Ferrari with another person, when it crashed and caught fire on a highway in Los Angeles on Sunday. \"This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,\" a spokesperson for Electronic Arts told the  BBC.Officials said the person on the vehicle's passenger seat was ejected while the driver remained trapped. It is unclear if Zampella was driving the car and who the other person inside was. Both people inside the vehicle died. \"For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,\" the California Highway Patrol said in a statement to the BBC. Zampella created Call of Duty with his long time collaborators Jason West and Grant Collier in 2003. Partly inspired by events in World War II, the game has sold more than 500 million copies making owners Microsoft's Activision one of the most profitable gaming companies. It has also spawned an upcoming live-action film.The Call of Duty franchise was not his only success. He was also behind other widely popular games including the Medal of Honor, Titanfall and Apex Legend.\"He really cared about the player experience, he cared about making games, he cared about how people felt when they played and that really came across whenever you spoke to him,\" Keza MacDonald, the Guardian's video games editor told BBC Newshour.In 2010, Zampella and West were fired from Activision, which publishes the Call of Duty games, and the pair were subsequently locked in a long dispute with the company which they settled out of court in 2012.At Electronic Arts, Zampella worked on Battlefield 6, which is seen as a direct competitor to Call of Duty.Infinity Ward, the American company that developed Call of Duty, said Zampella \"will always have a special place in our history\".\"Your legacy of creating iconic, lasting entertainment is immeasurable,\" the company said in a statement on X.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNicholas BourneandAngela Ferguson,BBC WalesA row over cat poo has gone to the high court after a homeowner kicked up a stink about a neighbour's pets allegedly doing their business in his garden.Richard Williamson from Bedwas complained to Caerphilly council, saying although cats had a right to roam, they \"do not have the right the cause a statutory nuisance or pose an environmental health risk\".He said he was concerned about the health risks to the family's newborn baby \"who will soon be playing in our garden\", court documents state.The authority investigated but said the cats were not governed by the same roaming laws as dogs and livestock and they had visited the cats' owner to check they had access to litter trays.However, a judge ordered the council to re-look at the complaint, saying it had not considered the nub of the matter - whether the fouling constituted a \"statutory nuisance\".\"Nothing in this judgment should be taken as expressing a view one way or the other on the outcome of the redetermination,\" wrote Judge Jarman KC, in documents published following the case heard at Cardiff High Court.Court documents show the plaintiff emailed his complaint to the council in October 2024, saying he had tried to resolve the issue with a neighbour.\"I wake with dread each day wondering if there is yet more cat mess for me to have to clean up,\" he wrote.\"As a parent of a newborn who will soon be playing in our garden, I am particularly concerned about the health risks associated with cat faeces.\"The documents show a council official visited the owner of the cats and was \"satisfied that there are adequate provisions for the cats\" in the property, like litter trays.And they wrote that cat owners were required to \"make considerations of welfare and not letting cats outside when they are accustomed to it, can be detrimental to their welfare\".In his judgment, the judge said the \"essence of the challenge\" was that, instead of considering whether the fouling \"amounted to deposits which were prejudicial to health\" under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the council focussed on \"the manner in which the cats were kept and/or considered the right at common law for cats to roam rather than whether there was a statutory nuisance\".Richard Williamson and Caerphilly council have been approached for comment.",

With just over a week still to go, the average UK air temperature across 2025 is on track to end up at about 10.05C.A cooler Christmas could affect final figures, but it is likely that 2025 will edge out the current record of 10.03C from 2022, the Met Office says.Along with a lack of rainfall, the persistent warmth left the country vulnerable to droughts and wildfires through the spring and summer, with temperatures peaking at 35.8C. While temperatures vary naturally from year to year, scientists could not be clearer that human-caused climate change is driving the UK's rapidly warming trend.By the end of 2025, the UK's 10 warmest years on record will all have taken place in the last two decades, in measurements going back to the late 1800s.\"Anthropogenic [human-caused] climate change is causing the warming in the UK as it's causing the warming across the world,\" said Amy Doherty, a climate scientist at the Met Office.\"What we have seen in the past 40 years, and what we're going to continue to see, is more records broken, more extremely hot years [...] so what was normal 10 years ago, 20 years ago, will become [relatively] cool in the future,\" she told BBC News.The Met Office's projection uses observed temperatures up to 21 December and assumes that the remaining days of the year follow the long-term December average. As a result, the Met Office cannot say with certainty that 2025 will be the hottest year, but it is the most likely outcome. It would be the sixth time this century that the UK has set a new annual temperature record, following 2002, 2003, 2006, 2014 and 2022.\"In terms of our climate, we are living in extraordinary times,\" said Mike Kendon, also of the Met Office. \"The changes we are seeing are unprecedented in observational records back to the 19th Century,\" he added.The expected new record of 2025 has been built on persistent heat through the spring and summer.Those long, hot, sunny days may feel like a distant memory as we head towards Christmas, but both spring and summer were the UK's warmest ever recorded.Each month from March to August was more than 2C above the long-term average between 1961 and 1990.And while temperatures may not have reached the peaks of 40C seen in July 2022, hot spells happened repeatedly.Four separate - albeit relatively short-lived - heatwaves were declared across much of the country. The UK Health Security Agency also issued several heat-health alerts through the summer.Spring and summer were also marked by low rainfall. Spring was particularly dry - the UK's sixth driest since 1836. Combined with the warm weather helping to dry out the soils, this lack of rainfall pushed large parts of the country towards drought. Through the summer, official droughts were declared across several regions in England and Wales, by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales respectively. Parts of eastern Scotland also entered \"significant water scarcity\", according to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.Recent rainfall has eased the situation across much of the country and most areas are no longer in official drought. But water levels are still below average in some places.\"There's a huge deficit to be made up, and there's a huge implication, not just for people who are farming the land [and] growing food, but our rivers, our aquifers, our availability of drinking water,\" said Jess Neumann, associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.The repeated swings between drought and flooding were making it very hard for communities to adapt to increasing weather extremes, she added.The prolonged dry, warm weather created ideal conditions for wildfires too.By late April, the area of the UK burned by wildfires had already reached a new annual record, according to data from the Global Wildfires Information System going back to 2012.More than 47,100 hectares (471 sq km or 182 sq miles) has now been burned throughout 2025 - smashing the previous high of 28,100 hectares of 2019.As the UK continues to heat up - driven by humanity's greenhouse gas emissions - scientists expect the UK to experience more weather extremes. \"The conditions that people are going to experience are going to continue to change as they have in the last few years [with] more wildfires, more droughts, more heatwaves,\" said Dr Doherty.\"But also it's going to get wetter in the winter half-year, so from October to March [...] the rain that does fall will fall more intensely, and in heavier rain showers, causing that kind of flooding that we've been seeing this year as well,\" she added.The UK has not been alone in experiencing extreme heat this year. The world is on course for its second or third warmest year ever recorded, according to the European Copernicus climate service.But the international consensus on tackling climate change is also being tested, with the US and some other leading producers of fossil fuels rowing back on their net zero commitments.

    "body": "5 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentA third remand detainee awaiting trial for alleged offences relating to the Palestine Action group has stopped a lengthy hunger strike, according to a letter sent to the government.The letter confirms that Qesser Zuhrah, the joint-first of eight to begin the hunger strike on 2 November, had ended her protest after 48 days.Lawyers for the group have given ministers until Tuesday afternoon to respond to a threat to go to the High Court over a refusal to hold talks. A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: \"We want these prisoners to accept support and get better, and we will not create perverse incentives that would encourage more people to put themselves at risk through hunger strikes.\"Three of the eight individuals participating in the protest have stopped while four are said to be still taking part.The eighth member of the group is now described by supporters as intermittently refusing to eat because of an underlying health condition.Ms Zuhrah was taken to hospital last week amid protests outside HMP Bronzefield claiming that she was being denied full medical assistance. MoJ officials have previously disputed claims of mistreatment. The Ministry does not comment publicly on the specific management of individuals.Amy Gardiner-Gibson, who also goes by the name Amu Gib and began a hunger strike on the same day as Ms Zuhrah, was reportedly transferred to hospital on Sunday on the 50th day of the protest.The other remaining hunger strikers are Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Kamran Ahmad. They are said to have been refusing food for 49 days, 43 days and 42 days respectively - accounts that have not been disputed by officials.Prison and NHS guidelines make clear that clinicians must oversee treatment decisions for hunger strikers. They can only be given food-related treatments if they consent or it is clear they lack the mental capacity to choose.In a detailed legal warning letter, lawyers for the group say they will ask the High Court to review Justice Secretary David Lammy's refusal to meet with their representatives if they do not receive a reply by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday.The group's lawyers say that prison service policies make clear that staff \"must make every effort\" to understand why a prisoner is refusing food and address the reasons.The group has called for the ban on Palestine Action to be lifted. The High Court has been reviewing the home secretary's decision to proscribe the group and a judgment is expected in the New Year.The protesters allege they have been treated unfairly and not bailed ahead of trials in 2026 and 2027.Some of these cases cannot be reported at this stage under standard laws designed to ensure a fair trial of all criminal suspects.\"Our clients' food refusal constitutes the largest co-ordinated hunger strike in British history since 1981,\" says the letter in a reference to the IRA hunger strikes.\"As of today's date, their strike has lasted up to 51 days, nearly two months, and poses a significant risk to their life with each passing day.\"The Care Quality Commission, which oversees prison healthcare, has told the BBC that it has been in contact with HMP Bronzefield, one of the jails where the protests have been taking place, for assurance that appropriate processes are in place after it had received \"information of concern\".It has not clarified what it was told in response.If ministers do not respond to the letter sent on behalf of the group by Tuesday afternoon, the group's lawyers could then ask the High Court to intervene on human rights grounds - although there is no certainty a judge would hold a hearing.Minister of State for Prisons, Probation and Reducing Reoffending Lord Timpson said: \"While very concerning, hunger strikes are not a new issue for our prisons. Over the last five years, we've averaged over 200 a year and we have longstanding procedures in place to ensure prisoner safety.\"Prison healthcare teams provide NHS care and continuously monitor the situation. HMPPS are clear that claims that hospital care is being refused are entirely misleading – they will always be taken when needed and a number of these prisoners have already been treated in hospital.\"These prisoners are charged with serious offences including aggravated burglary and criminal damage. Remand decisions are for independent judges, and lawyers can make representations to the court on behalf of their clients.\"Ministers will not meet with them - we have a justice system that is based on the separation of powers, and the independent judiciary is the cornerstone of our system. It would be entirely unconstitutional and inappropriate for ministers to intervene in ongoing legal cases.\"",

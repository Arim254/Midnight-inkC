    "body": "2 hours agoThe White House has warned that the collapse of a case against two people accused of spying for China \"risks undermining the special relationship\" between the UK and US, according to the Sunday Times. A senior Trump official tells the paper that the US exercises \"extreme caution in sharing information with foreign government subject to adversarial coercion and influence.\"The Daily Express reports that the chancellor Rachel Reeves is considering a £7bn \"tax raid\" on pensioners to \"plug a black hole in her Budget\". Reeves could hike taxes on pension contributions and on withdrawals by retirees, according to experts cited by the paper. Whereas the Sunday Telegraph writes that wealthier people will be forced to \"contribute more\" in the chancellor's Budget. A Treasury source tells the paper that Reeves is prepared to make \"tough decisions\", but insists there will be no \"return to austerity\". The front page also features a photo of the relatives of Israeli hostages - due to be released by Hamas on Monday.The Duke of York told the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that \"We are in this together\" in 2011, the Mail on Sunday reports. The emails appear to contradict Prince Andrew's claim in a BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 that he \"never had any contact\" with Epstein after they were photographed together in New York in 2010. Several papers lead with the death of disgraced paedophile Ian Watkins, who was attacked while serving a 29-year sentence for child sex offences at HMS Wakefield. The Sunday Mirror reports the former Lostprophets frontman was \"ambushed\" while in jail.\"Monster murdered\" is the headline for the Daily Star, which reports that Watkins \"had his throat slashed\" in an attack by a fellow prisoner.A photo of Watkins also features on the front page of the Sunday People, but the paper leads with remarks from former prime minister Gordon Brown urging voters to \"fight Farage\". In an interview with the paper, Brown said the Reform UK leader's funding cuts would bring \"more suffering\" to children and pensioners.The Observer's front page is dedicated in full to a photo of a Palestinian family walking through rubble on their return to Gaza City.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoHolly HarrisonBBC WalesSouth Wales PoliceThe disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offencesLostprophets singer Ian Watkins has died after being attacked in jail, prison sources have confirmed.West Yorkshire Police said two men aged 25 and 43 had been arrested on suspicion of murder.The disgraced rock star from Pontypridd was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for child sex offences.Watkins, 48, was jailed in December 2013 for a string of child sex offences, including the attempted rape of a baby.Police said they were called to the prison on Saturday morning to reports of a serious assault on a prisoner, who was pronounced dead at the scene.A Prison Service spokesperson said it was aware of an incident at the prison. \"We are unable to comment further while the police investigate.\"He was attacked in prison in August 2023, but his injuries were not life threatening.Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison with a further six years on licence, and his two co-defendants, the mothers of children he abused, were jailed for 14 and 17 years.The attack at Wakefield Prison comes less than two weeks after a report into the facility was published that found violence there had \"increased markedly\".The report from the chief inspector of prisons said: \"Many prisoners told us they felt unsafe, particularly older men convicted of sexual offences who increasingly shared the prison with a growing cohort of younger prisoners.\"Police were called to Wakefield Prison on Saturday morningWatkins admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape.He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal.Judges rejected an appeal by Watkins in 2014 to reduce the length of his jail term.During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke \"new ground\" and \"plunged into new depths of depravity\".\"Any decent person... will experience shock, revulsion and incredulity.\"The judge said Watkins had a \"corrupting influence\", and had shown a \"complete lack of remorse\".As a rock star in his 20s, Watkins sold millions of albums around the world and commanded huge arena crowds.Formed in 1997, Welsh rock band Lostprophets released five studio albums in total, including a number one album in the UK and two top 10 singles.Getty ImagesWatkins performing in London a few months before his arrest in 2012They also saw some success in the US, where their second and third albums both reached the top 40.After Watkins was sentenced, Des Mannion, NSPCC national head of service for Wales, said: \"Watkins used his status and global fame as a means to manipulate people and sexually abuse children.\"But we must nevertheless remember that this case isn't about celebrity, it's about victims. And those victims are children.\"",

Willis said accepting the role at Birmingham Women's and Children's Hospital and Charity was \"a dream come true\". The Birmingham-born star, known for presenting shows including Love is Blind, The Voice and Delivering Babies, has supported the children's hospital for more than a decade, the trust said. Her new role will see her champion both hospitals, raise awareness and help to secure funds for treatment, research and patient care. She joins Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark, as the hospital and charity's second patron.Willis said: \"I've known for a long time how special Birmingham Children's Hospital is after it saved the life of one of my oldest friend's sons.\" She said she had accepted the position \"without hesitation\".\"I've never been asked to be a patron before, so it was an incredibly proud moment for me and my family,\" Willis said. \"I'm keen to get stuck in and help raise awareness of the hospitals' life-saving impact as well as the vital funds it needs to go above and beyond for patients.\"She called the hospitals' impact \"truly inspirational\", adding \"I'm delighted to combine my love for the Children's with my passion for women's health and maternity services\". The trust said Birmingham Women's Hospital ran the busiest maternity unit in the country, with around 8,200 births annually, while Birmingham Children's Hospital is home to Europe's largest paediatric intensive care unit.Mark Brider, chief executive of the hospital charity, said they were \"thrilled and deeply honoured\" to welcome her as patron.He said: \"Her passion for our patients brings joy every time she visits. With her inspiring support, we'll be able to amplify our impact even further.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentiStock/Getty ImagesAre you ill? If not, you probably know someone who is - or at the very least someone who has just recovered. Coughs and colds, it seems, are rampant at the moment.And, if the anecdotes of people I know are anything to go by, the bug going round seems to be a particularly nasty one. Sore throat? Tick. Streaming nose? Tick. Sinus pressure? Double tick.What's going on?The perfect breeding ground\"This is normal, it's autumn after all,\" says Prof Jonathan Ball, from Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.He says a combination of children returning to school, adults back at work after the summer break and people spending more time indoors as the weather turns cooler creates a ripe breeding ground for respiratory viruses to flourish.\"Basically we have a big mixing pot of different viruses that are beginning to do the rounds. Immunity has waned and people are getting ill.\" There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. Is there more illness than normal?Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.\"There is often, although not always, a pattern,\" says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. \"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV,\" he explains. \"Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal.\"He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.\"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level.\"Is it a cold, flu or Covid?The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:ColdsSymptoms appear graduallyMostly affect nose and throatEarly sign - pressure in your earsChestier, mucus coughFluComes on suddenlyFeel wiped outFever, muscle aches, exhaustionNeed bed restDry coughCovidTypical flu symptomsLoss of taste of smellDiarrhoea or tummy upsetMany of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.How can you protect yourself?Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. \"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why,\" admits Prof Ball. \"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus.\"In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for flu, Covid and RSV to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.\"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.\"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "A tiny island with more sheep than people needs a new tenant - could you live here?3 days agoNathan BevanBBC WalesBBCDespite its remoteness, the island is described as being \"very much a living community\"A tiny island off Gwynedd's Llŷn Peninsula, with more sheep than humans, is looking for new nature-loving inhabitants to live and work there. Ynys Enlli, also known as Bardsey Island, is wind-whipped, sea-sprayed and most definitely off-grid, boasting - as it does - a current year-round population of just three people. In 2023, it also became the first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in Europe, meaning its unspoiled view of the night sky is protected for current and future generations.And now, for the first time in almost 20 years, the trust which owns and runs the island, is welcoming one adventurous family or couple to its craggy shoreline - and the \"opportunity of a lifetime\". Bardsey Island Trust is asking anyone who might be interested in moving there to come forward, with the successful applicant settling on the island in September 2026.Once comfortably installed, the newest residents will be in charge of managing its 200 sheep and 25 Welsh Black cattle, alongside current tenant famer Gareth Roberts, from Aberdaron.\"Gareth and his family have been there since 2007, and he knows the island intimately - and the challenges and benefits of living on Enlli,\" said the trust's chief officer, Sian Stacey, adding Mr Roberts will mentor the new arrivals.Measuring just 440 acres (0.69 square miles), the island is a national nature reserve and a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).International Dark Sky Sanctuary certification saw the island join 16 other sites worldwide, each of them recognised as the most remote and dark places on Earth. However, with a handful of seasonal residents living there temporarily, as wardens, for some of the year, Sian described it as being \"very much a living community\".\"I lived there for three years myself - it's an amazing place to be,\" she said.  What is Bardsey Island famous for?No wifi or electricity in the houses, and the water flows straight from a wellIt's a mile and a half at its longest and a half mile at its widestThe \"Burial Place of 20,000 Saints\" hails from the early Middle Ages, when it was believed three pilgrimages to Enlli were as spiritually significant as one to RomePilgrims, pirates, fishermen, and farmers have been visiting the island since the 2nd Century BC200 sheepThe 1821 lighthouse still stands at the southern end of the islandEurope's first Dark Sky SanctuaryHome to 30,000 breeding pairs of Manx shearwaterAmanda RuggeriThe island's sheep vastly outnumber its human residentsHailed as one of the holiest places in Britain during the Middle Ages, Ynys Enlli has been dubbed the Island of 20,000 Saints. Legend also casts it as the final resting place of pilgrims from across the world seeking salvation. An excavation in the 1990s unearthed dozens of medieval graves.More stories like this Related internet links",

    "body": "12 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter at Cliveden Literary FestivalThe Queen has shared a wistful but mischievous memory of her longstanding friend Dame Jilly Cooper, as she spoke at a book festival six days after the author's death at the age of 88.Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival in Berkshire, Queen Camilla affectionately recalled an anecdote about Dame Jilly.\"She came to a party here a few years ago where, I hope, she uttered her immortal line, 'I'm going to get so absolutely plastered tonight, darling. I love you so much, I want to see two of you',\" she said, to laughter in the room.\"Dear Jilly, how we'd love to have seen just one of you here with us today.\"The Queen also revealed that the Vesper Martini, which was invented by author Ian Fleming as James Bond's drink of choice, was a favourite tipple of the \"much missed\" Dame Jilly.At the event, Queen Camilla met the festival's founders and panellists.She then officially opened the festival, delivering a speech before a panel discussion on the importance of reading and studying literature.Queen Camilla then hosted a reception in the French Dining Room, with attendees including Sir Salman Rushdie and Sir Ian Rankin.Earlier in the week, Queen Camilla led the tributes to Dame Jilly, who died after a fall.In a statement, she said she hoped her hereafter would be filled \"with impossibly handsome men and devoted dogs\".Since Dame Jilly's death, there has been an outpouring of love for her.Many of the themes that dominated her so-called bonkbusters - sex, affection and horses - have been central to those tributes.At the festival, others shared their love and affection for Dame Jilly.Speaking to reporters, Sir Ian said he had read her novel Rivals and \"loved it\".He said he had met her multiple times, and that they had kept in touch.\"I got lovely letters from her, long letters and cards and everything , I think my wife was quite worried at one point,\" he joked.He added that she was a \"terrific writer,\" while Sir Salman simply said it was \"a sad loss\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoMaia DaviesPA MediaThe prime minister will attend an international peace summit in Egypt on Monday where the peace plan for Gaza will be signed, Downing Street has said.Sir Keir Starmer will pay \"particular tribute\" in Sharm El-Sheikh to US President Donald Trump, No 10 added.A ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal brokered by Trump, with the next phases still to be negotiated.  The US president will lead the summit alongside Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi with leaders from more than 20 countries in attendance, a spokesman for al-Sisi said.Under the deal, Hamas has until 12:00 (09:00 GMT) on Monday to release all Israeli hostages - including 20 who are believed to be alive, and the remains of up to 28 deceased hostages.Israel should also release around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza, while increased amounts of aid should enter the Strip.Many details for the later phases, which would be negotiated after the successful completion of phase one, could be hard to reach agreement on - such as the governance of Gaza, the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarming of Hamas.Downing Street said Monday's summit would involve a \"signing ceremony\" for the peace plan, \"marking a historic turning point for the region after two years of conflict and bloodshed\".Sir Keir will thank Egypt, Qatar and Turkey for \"bringing us to this point\" as well as Trump, before calling for continued coordination to secure \"swift progress towards phase two\" of the truce.No 10 added in its statement: \"He will offer the UK's steadfast support and engagement with international partners as we look to secure the ceasefire, get urgently needed humanitarian assistance into Gaza and secure a basis for a lasting peace and security.\"French President Emmanuel Macron will also attend, the Elysee Palace confirmed on Saturday, where he will \"express his full support for the implementation of the agreement\". Confirming the summit late on Saturday, a spokesperson for Egypt's presidency said it was intended to \"end the war in the Gaza Strip, strengthen peace and stability efforts in the Middle East, and open a new page in regional security and stability\".Trump had told reporters at the White House on Friday that he would be travelling to the region on Monday, addressing Israel's parliament the Knesset, before heading to Egypt.He said: \"We have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming too, they've been invited.\"Egypt's foreign ministry had also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit with Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty.The ceasefire came into effect after the Israeli government approved the first phase of Trump's ceasefire and hostage return deal on Thursday, following three days of indirect talks in Egypt.The Israeli military said it had partially withdrawn troops from parts of Gaza and pulled back to an agreed position within the territory - though troops still occupy half of the Strip. The UK has already said it has \"no plans\" to send British troops to be part of a multinational force that will monitor the latest ceasefire from Israel.The US is moving up to 200 troops already based in the region to what it is calling a civil-military coordination centre in Israel, officials have said, alongside forces from Arab and Muslim countries including Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Friday the UK would continue to support the peace process in other ways, including looking at getting private finance into Gaza.Israel's war on Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 18,000 children, the Hamas-run health ministry says.A previous ceasefire agreement that began in January collapsed after two months when Israel resumed its military offensive, having never got past the first stage of a three-stage plan.",

    "body": "Indian student captured by Ukraine joined Russian army to avoid drug charges, says mother 3 hours agoGopal KateshiyaBBC Gujarati, MorbiHasina MajotiSahil Majothi had gone to Russia to study computer engineeringUkraine has captured an Indian national allegedly fighting for Russian forces, the first known Indian detained in the ongoing war.Sahil Majothi, 22, from the Indian state of Gujarat, went to Russia to study computer engineering two years ago. His mother claims he was falsely accused in a drug case last April.Mr Majothi joined the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges,  according to a video released by Ukraine's army on Tuesday.The Indian foreign ministry says it is investigating the case and has not received formal communication from Ukraine. The BBC has asked the Russian government for a response. In an interview with BBC Gujarati, Mr Majothi's mother Hasina Majothi said her son went to Russia in January 2024. He completed a three-month language course in St Petersburg before moving to Moscow for college, supporting himself part-time as a kitchenware courier.She alleges that in April 2024, someone slipped drugs into a parcel handed to Mr Majothi during his deliveries.\"The police caught him with it and charged him,\" Ms Hasina said. According to Ms Hasina, her son was detained, held for six months and later sentenced to seven years in prison. The family hired a private lawyer in Russia to defend him, but they had no idea when or how he was drafted into the military.\"I don't know how he ended up in Ukraine. I only found out through the viral video,\" Ms Hasina said.In the video released by the 63rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army, Mr Majothi can be heard saying he was given a choice between joining the Russian army, with pay for his service, or serving jail time. He said he was told he would serve in the military for a year before being released. Mr Majothi claims that different people promised him varying amounts of money - from a hundred thousand to over a million roubles - but he never received any payment.He says he underwent 15 days of training in September 2024 and was sent to the battlefield a year later, on 30 September.The next day, on 1 October, Mr Majothi said he had an altercation with his commander, after which he separated from Russian soldiers. That was when he came across a Ukrainian dugout and asked them for help, he added.The BBC cannot independently verify the date or location of the video in which he makes these claims. Ukrainian army/FacebookMr Majothi says he underwent 15 days of training before being sent to the battlefield a year laterOn Wednesday, after the video went viral, Gujarat's Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS)  questioned Ms Hasina and her brother in Ahmedabad. Her relatives said she separated from her husband around her son's birth and supports her family as a seamstress while living with her maternal relatives.ATS officials confirmed Mr Majothi's arrest and subsequent detention in Russia. They said the family claimed to have had no contact with him since his arrest. At his former school in Morbi, teachers called Mr Majothi an \"average student\" but deeply motivated to fulfil his mother's dreams through education. They spoke on condition of anonymity.Local community leaders have also appealed to the government to intervene and secure his return. \"Many young men like him have been trapped and dragged into the war,\" said  Kasam Sumra. \"We appeal to the government to bring back Sahil and other young Indians who went abroad seeking work.\" Mr Majothi's arrest comes amid rising concerns over Indians being recruited into the Russian military. Reports say over 150 Indians, some on student or visitor visas, have enlisted. At least 12 have died in the conflict and 16 remain missing.In September, Indian officials urged Moscow to release and repatriate 27 Indian nationals who had been recruited into the army.The Indian government has consistently advised its citizens against participating in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\"We once again strongly urge all Indian nationals to stay away from offers to serve in the Russian army, as they are fraught with danger and risk to life,\" a spokesperson from India's foreign ministry said last month.Additional reporting by Roxy Gagdekar Chhara from Ahmedabad and Nikita Yadav from DelhiFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "7 hours agoTim FranksPetah TikvaBBCDr Steinman says working at the unit has taught her the \"strength of the human spirit\"When the first hostages are released by Hamas in Gaza, taken into Israel and transferred by helicopter to the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Dr Michal Steinman will take them up to the sixth floor, swipe open the glass door and see them reunite with their closest family after more than 700 days in captivity.\"It is a privilege,\" says the head of nursing. \"These are the moments, when I'm 70 or 80, these are the two or three moments I will remember. They symbolise so many values – as a nurse, as a mother, as a woman, as an Israeli.\"Twenty living hostages are due to be released under the terms of the agreement between Israel and Hamas. Several of them will be brought to this hospital.It will be the third time that the hostages' unit has gone operational. The BBC visited the unit on Saturday, when the medical team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating.\"There is no such field as captivity medicine, and we are inventing it,\" said Dr Steinman told the BBC on Saturday, after the team learned the identities of the hostages they would be treating. The staff have learned two big lessons from the two previous hostage releases in November 2023 and January this year, she says.  The first is to be \"a medical detective\", to try to understand what happened in those long days and nights of captivity.  With earlier, often emaciated, shackled, beaten hostages, \"they had things in their blood exams, in their enzymes, that we couldn't understand\".  Follow live updatesWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?What we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityThey also have learned that symptoms may not present for days or weeks.  \"Captivity does things to your body that your body remembers. You see all these layers. It takes time to see what happened to their bodies, to their souls,\" she said.  \"We're still taking care of the hostages who came back in January and February, and every week we discover new things.\"ReutersIt's the third time the hospital's unit has received freed hostages after previous release deals in late 2023 and January this year (file photo)The other lesson is to take time. There are a huge number of professionals from different disciplines: nutritionists, social workers, mental health specialists, along with the full panoply of medical staff.  But there is also a \"do not disturb\" card on the door of each released hostage's private room. The echoes of a hotel are deliberate, as are the care packages and soft furnishings and soft lighting to go with the hospital bed and monitors. There is an extra single bed made up for those hostages who don't want to be left alone overnight, so that a partner or relative can sleep alongside them. Their closest family will also have their own bedroom directly across the corridor from the hostage's.\"You know medical people are task-oriented. There's a schedule,\" says Dr Steinman. \"Here you have to give them much more space. You have to decide what's urgent, and what can wait another two days. You have to be humble and flexible, without letting go of your medical responsibility.\"Among those responsibilities is determining what the hostages, some of whom may have lost more than half their body weight in captivity, can eat, and how quickly.Their physical recuperation is only part of the story. Karina Shwartz is director of social work at the Rabin Medical Center.  She is another key member of the team, with a responsibility not just for the hostages but for their closest relatives. They need to learn their own delicate calibration of family dynamics – of when to speak and when not to, she says.\"The most important thing is what we're not saying,\" she says. \"Because if we're sitting in the room, and someone tells us something very difficult about how they almost died in captivity, and we stay silent: it's a very loud silence.\"But at the same time, there is a need to hold back. \"We can't speak about two years in a week. The hostages need space and time. They also need quiet. We have to listen. To listen to their story.\"Karina Shwartz and her team will prepare the hostages to leave the hospital and re-enter the outside worldThe staff in the hostage returns unit emphasise that their job does not end when the hostages return home. Medical and psychological rehabilitation will continue and the hostages must also be prepared, says Ms Shwartz, for the moment \"when the real world comes in\".  The message she and her team try to drill into the hostages and their families is that everyone will want to see them. For two years they have been public figures.\"Everyone will want to be friends.  We tell them: it's okay to say no. It's safe to say no.\"For now, the nervous anticipation among the staff is palpable.\"You should see my WhatsApp messages,\" says Dr Steinman, a very Israeli director of nursing with her nose piercing and multiple tattoos. Pretty much every single one of her 1,700 nurses across the medical complex has, she says, volunteered to pull extra shifts on the unit.  \"You gain hope again,\" she says. \"Working here you realise that life and human beings are good. You realise the strength of the human spirit.\"And yet, the greatest pleasure, she says, will be for that work to be over. \"This is the third time we're opening the unit.  To know that this is the last time: that when we close this place and say the mission is done.  Then we will know that the nightmare is over.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondent in IstanbulHamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control over areas of Gaza recently vacated by Israeli troops, according to local sources.The Palestinian group also appointed five new governors all with military backgrounds, some of whom previously commanded brigades in its armed wing.The mobilisation order was reportedly issued via phone calls and text messages which said the aim was to \"cleanse Gaza of outlaws and collaborators with Israel\" and told fighters to report within 24 hours.Reports from Gaza suggest that armed Hamas units have already deployed across several districts, some wearing civilian clothes and others in the blue uniforms of the Gaza police.Tensions rose sharply and quickly after two members of Hamas's elite forces were shot dead by gunmen from the powerful Dughmush clan in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhood. One of them was the son of a senior commander in Hamas's armed wing, Imad Aqel, who now heads the group's military intelligence.Their bodies were left in the street, triggering anger and raising the prospect of a major armed response by Hamas.Hamas members later surrounded a large area where more than 300 Dughmush gunmen were believed to be holed up, armed with machine guns and improvised explosives.This morning Hamas killed one Dughmush clan member, and reportedly kidnapped another 30.Some of the clan's weapons were looted from Hamas depots during the war, while others had been in the clan's possession for years.Follow live updatesPalestinians return to devastation in Gaza CityWhat we know about the Gaza ceasefire agreementWho are the 48 hostages still held in Gaza?The Hamas mobilisation had been widely anticipated amid growing uncertainty about who will govern Gaza once the war ends.This is a key issue that could complicate the start of the second phase of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm.A Hamas official abroad declined to comment directly on reports of the security deployment, but told the BBC: \"We cannot leave Gaza at the mercy of thieves and militias backed by the Israeli occupation. Our weapons are legitimate... to resist occupation, and they will remain as long as the occupation continues.\"A retired security officer who served for years with the Palestinian Authority in Gaza said he feared the territory was sliding towards another round of internal bloodshed. \"Hamas hasn't changed. It still believes that weapons and violence are the only means to keep its movement alive,\" he told the BBC. \"Gaza is flooded with arms. Looters have stolen thousands of weapons and rounds of ammunition from Hamas stores during the war, and some groups have even received supplies from Israel. \"This is a perfect recipe for civil war: weapons, frustration, chaos, and a movement desperate to reassert control over a shattered and exhausted population.\"Khalil Abu Shammala, a human rights expert who lives in Gaza, said it remained to be seen whether Hamas would accept handing over control on the ground or seek to obstruct the plan's implementation.  \"There is undoubtedly widespread fear among many Gazans of potential internal fighting, given the many conditions that could fuel it,\" he said.He said Hamas had been forced to accept the peace plan by the severe pressure it was under.\"I believe its continued attempts to maintain influence by any means, including involvement in security affairs, could ultimately jeopardise the agreement and plunge Gaza's residents into even greater suffering,\" he said.These developments since the ceasefire earlier this week have sparked deep concern among Gazans already worn down by two years of a devastating conflict.",

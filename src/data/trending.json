    "body": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.It took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.After beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.The 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.While athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.The final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.The ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.In her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"It ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.Team GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.Matt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.The female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.Team GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.Brazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.Georgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.For hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.Norway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.Had Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.The oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.Skiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.The Games also had controversial moments.Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.But the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.There was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.Filippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.Men's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.The ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.The presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.There was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.As well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.",

    "body": "Australian prosecutors consider reopening British girl's cold case disappearance13 minutes agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentFamily handoutCheryl Grimmer was three when she disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in January 1970The family of a British girl who disappeared in Australia more than 55 years ago has welcomed a decision by prosecutors to consider reopening her case.Three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer disappeared from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970. Despite extensive searches, there were no leads.A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder in 2017, but his trial collapsed after his teenage confession was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the case.After public pressure - including from the girl's family - the New South Wales (NSW) director of public prosecutions now says her office is willing to conduct a special review of that decision.In a letter to Grimmer's family, Sally Dowling said the normal time limit for families to request a review had expired, but that she had agreed to look at the case anyway.She said she could review the case now, based on evidence police handed over in 2019, or the family could wait until detectives have considered the \"fresh\" information they say they have found.\"It's taken way too many years but finally we're really happy that they see our fight for some justice for Cheryl,\" Ricki Nash, Cheryl's older brother, told the BBC.Nash said they had written to NSW Police to request they reopen an investigation, taking into account new evidence that has come to light since 2019.\"We are not asking for anything extraordinary,\" he said. \"When transparency leads the process, evil can no longer hide behind process failures or bureaucratic division.\"On the day Cheryl disappeared, Nash had been put in charge of his younger siblings as the family got ready to leave the beach. He was told to go to the bathroom block and Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms, refusing to come out.Too embarrassed to enter himself, Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned, 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.Cheryl's family has been pushing for a fresh investigation ever since the trial collapsed seven years ago. They argue that lots of missteps were made by NSW authorities in their search for Cheryl.Last October, Jeremy Buckingham, a member of NSW Legislative Council, the state's upper house, used parliamentary privilege to name the suspect. He had been known only as Mercury, as his real name is legally protected because he was a minor at the time of the alleged crime.In May, there will also be a NSW parliamentary inquiry looking into cases of unsolved murders and long-term missing people – Cheryl Grimmer's case will form a part of the inquiry.",

    "body": "Kim Jong Un re-appointed leader of North Korea's ruling party3 hours agoKoh EweAFP via Getty ImagesIn his opening speech at the congress, Kim Jong Un vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of livingNorth Korea's ruling Workers' Party has again chosen Kim Jong Un to be its general secretary, state media report.The announcement by the rubber-stamp party congress on Sunday comes as little surprise given the Kim family has ruled the dictatorship since the late 1940s.State-run KCNA said that under Kim's leadership North Korea \"radically improved\" its \"war deterrence\", \"with the nuclear forces as its pivot\".Despite long-standing international sanctions, North Korea has continued to build its nuclear capabilities, regularly testing banned intercontinental missiles. But the secrecy of the regime makes it harder to evaluate how much progress the military has made.  Kim, who took over control of the regime after his father's death in 2011, has invested heavily in the nuclear weapons programme, turning Pyongyang into a far bigger challenge for the West, and especially the US.  He is expected to announce the next phase of the country's weapons programme during the congress, which is now in its fourth day. Before it started, North Korea unveiled what it said was a range of nuclear-capable rocket launchers.The congress, which has been held once every five years in the last decade, began on 19 February.With some 5,000 party members in attendance, according to KCNA, it offers a rare glimpse into the structure of political power in North Korea, which remains quite opaque even to the keenest watchers.The meetings are considered to be the most important political event and provide insight into where the country's priorities lie, from foreign policy to its nuclear ambitions.While Kim has remained at the top of North Korean leadership, the party congress' presidium, or executive committee, has been reshuffled since the last meeting in 2021. More than half of its 39 members have been replaced, according to state media.In his opening speech last week, Kim vowed to boost the country's economy and people's standard of living, which he described as \"heavy and urgent historic tasks\".And all eyes are on whether Kim's daughter, Ju Ae, will make an appearance.Earlier this month, South Korea's spy agency said that Kim had chosen Ju Ae as his heir. Kim Ju Ae, believed to be 13 years old, has become an increasingly prominent figure at official events - inspecting missiles and attending Beijing's military parade with her father.",

    "body": "William 'not calm, but carrying on' after Andrew arrest and a Bafta for Buckley4 hours agoThe fallout from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest continues to dominate Monday's papers. The Daily Mail leads with the Prince of Wales' comments as he attended the Bafta awards on Sunday, where he was asked whether he had seen the film Hamnet: \"I need to be in quite a calm state and I am not at the moment - I will save it.\" The paper says Prince William's appearance at the ceremony with Catherine, the Princess of Wales \"signalled a determination to put the Royal Family's difficulties to one side\".\"William: I need to calm down\" the Daily Mirror echoes as it fills its front page with Prince William and Catherine arriving at the Baftas. The event marks the Royal couple's first public appearance since Andrew's arrest. The paper adds that Prince William is understood to be \"making plans to restore public trust in the monarchy\" amid the scandal. The Sun follows with the same picture of Prince William and Catherine with the caption: \"Not calm, but he's carrying on.\"The Daily Star says the Royal Family is facing a \"crisis\" as the investigation continues and police try to gain access to files kept at Buckingham Palace. The King has reportedly told his staff to give police access to his own files as they investigate Andrew's ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Metro. \"Access all areas\" is the headline. Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.Staying with Jeffrey Epstein, the Daily Telegraph reports that the late sex offender hid computers and photographs from US authorities in secret storage lockers across America. The paper cites documents that show Epstein paid private detectives to remove equipment from his Florida home in an \"apparent attempt to prevent investigators from finding it\".According to the Times, the Metropolitan Police started re-examining trafficking allegations related to Jeffrey Epstein, but investigators have been told that some of the evidence has been destroyed. Moving to news closer to home, the Guardian says ministers will reveal a \"generational\" overhaul of special educational needs support on Monday, pledging a £4bn package. Elsewhere, the top picture spot is taken by Bafta best actress winner Jesse Buckley, who called the award \"an incredible honour\".Jesse Buckley's \"triumph\" at the Baftas also leads the Independent's front page. Alongside, the paper reveals Apple AirTags and small tracking devices are being \"weaponised\" by stalkers, forcing some victims to flee their homes and change jobs.The i Paper shifts its focus to Peter Mandelson, reporting that the government \"fast-tracked\" security vetting for the former ambassador to the US despite knowing about his links to Epstein. However, the government says it was normal to prioritise vetting and any suggestion that part of the process was missed is \"false\".The Daily Express says it has seen documents from Sir Keir Starmer's time as top prosecutor that show he oversaw the use of \"paedophile Asbos\" that let suspects off with warnings.Finally, the Financial Times reports that Iran agreed to a secret €500m arms deal with Russia to acquire thousands of advanced missiles in an attempt to rebuild is air defences in its war with Israel last year.The Daily Telegraph says it has seen documents that show Jeffrey Epstein rented six storage units across the US as part of what the paper calls \"an apparent attempt\" to hide computers and other documents from investigators. It says the units were never raided \"raising the possibility that they may contain unseen evidence\" relating to the sex offender and his associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.The front pages of the Sun and the Daily Mirror feature images of the Prince and Princess of Wales at the Bafta film awards, making their first public appearance since Andrew's arrest. Both papers highlight a comment by Prince William after he revealed he was not feeling \"calm\" at the moment.The Daily Mail says MPs will push for greater scrutiny of the Royal Family when they return to Westminster today with some demanding answers over how Andrew was able to represent the UK as a trade envoy for a decade \"with seemingly minimal oversight\". The former prince has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.The Times reports that the Metropolitan Police began re-examining allegations that victims of Epstein were trafficked into the UK via RAF bases and commercial airports three months ago, but detectives have been told that some of the evidence has been destroyed. It says some of the flights date back two decades but the RAF retains passenger manifests for only three months while commercial airlines generally keep them for six to seven years.Sir Keir Starmer has told the Times that his late brother's learning difficulties are the inspiration behind the government's reform of special educational needs.  Writing in the paper, the prime minister says Nick Starmer struggled to be \"seen\" in the classroom, and was written off by the system.The front page of the Guardian includes a photo of the British actor, Robert Aramayo, holding the two Baftas he won last night.  The paper's film critic, Peter Bradshaw, says his triumph over Hollywood A-listers in the best actor category was the \"biggest upset\" of the ceremony and \"the thoroughly well-deserved feel-good moment of the night\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "14 hours agoEd CampbellBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesGordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports.The former prime minister wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Andrew's time as UK trade envoy, the Sunday Telegraph says.Andrew was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No 10.The paper also reports that Brown has demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links the former prince's government work to late financier Epstein.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Brown told the BBC last week that he had \"submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies\".He said: \"This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.\"When asked about these flights by the BBC in October 2025, the Ministry of Defence said \"it is standard practice for spare capacity at RAF airfields in the UK to be used for private or commercial aircraft, subject to fees which cover all costs\".It added that such use \"is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield\". The MoD repeated this response when asked by the BBC again on Sunday.In an email message, Jon Swain asks if Andrew had secured permission for Epstein to use military bases. The question is forwarded to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell - who in 2021 was convicted in the US for her role in luring underage girls for him.Epstein responds to say, \"just spoke to Larry… it's true\". The man named Larry was Epstein's chief pilot, who arranged many of his landings and logistics. Maxwell then responds using an expletive.The Sunday Telegraph says Brown is requesting that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.Andrew was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of files connected to the late financier's case - including claims he shared information with Epstein while trade envoy.Searches are continuing this weekend at his former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.",

    "body": "7 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesAn armed man has been shot dead after entering the secure perimeter of US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the Secret Service has said.The man was carrying a shotgun and fuel can when he was stopped and shot by Secret Service agents and a Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.The incident happened around 01:30 ET (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning, when the president was in Washington DC. The suspect has been named as Austin T Martin of Cameron, North Carolina, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.His family in North Carolina had reported him missing in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Moore County Sheriff's Office said in a statement to the BBC. The missing persons information has since been turned over to federal authorities, the sheriff's office said.They added that the department had no prior history involving Martin and it was not involved in the Florida investigation.Officials are looking into whether he bought the gun along the driving route he took from North Carolina to Florida, according to CBS.Secret Service agents fired at him after they saw him \"unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning\", agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on X.The suspect \"was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\", the agency said in a statement.The man was then shot after refusing orders, Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items' which means the gas can and the shotgun,\" Bradshaw told a news conference. \"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" he said. At that point, agents fired their weapons to \"neutralise the threat\", he said.FacebookThe suspect had been reported missing by relatives, according to CBSThe officers were wearing body cameras and no law enforcement officers were injured, he added.Bradshaw said that he does not know if the suspect's gun was loaded, and that will form part of an investigation, which the FBI will be assisting in.US Secret Service Director Sean Curran travelled to Florida on Sunday for \"after-actions\" and has \"reinvigorated operational communication and agency response to critical incidents\", the agency said in a post on X. Security at Mar-a-Lago is extremely tight, with an outer cordon of local Palm Beach sheriffs and an inner one maintained by the Secret Service. Visitors are searched, and cars and bags are swept by dogs and metal detectors.Trump has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.In July 2024, Trump was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bystander was killed and two were injured in the shooting. The shooter, 20-year-old Matthew Crooks, was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.Months later, a US Secret Service agent spotted a rifle sticking out of bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The man, later identified as Ryan Routh, fled but was caught. The 59-year-old was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for attempting to assassinate the president.During an appearance on Fox Business after the fatal incident, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the the political left for \"normalising\" political violence,  citing the two attempts on Trump's life in 2024,\"Two would-be assassins dead, one in jail for life, and this venom coming from the other side,\" Bessent said, adding: \"They are normalising this violence. It's got to stop.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterGetty ImagesThe government says it will spend billions to make mainstream schools in England more inclusive for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).That includes £1.6bn over three years going directly to schools, early years settings and colleges, and £1.8bn over the same period to provide more access to experts such as specialist teachers and speech and language therapists.The new money is part of a major SEND system overhaul, with government plans for a series of school reforms due to be published in full on Monday.Teaching unions said they would be scrutinising the proposals closely, with one saying the money was \"barely a drop in the bucket\" of what was needed because of \"years of underfunding\".That included plans to reassess children's education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - the legal documents setting out what support they are entitled to - after they leave primary school, and again after GCSEs.That change could lead to fewer children retaining their EHCPs, which are an expensive part of the SEND system, into secondary school. Children in Year 6 in 2029 would be the first to be reviewed under the plans, ahead of starting secondary school in 2030.Disability charities and campaign groups said that would raise concerns among parents, worried that support could be withdrawn at a time when \"stability is critical\".The leaked plans also included proposals for new individual support plans (ISPs) for all children with SEND, which would have some level of legal backing.Currently, just over 480,000 of the 1.7 million pupils with SEND in England have EHCPs.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support for children\"Responding to the announcement of more money targeted towards making mainstream schools more inclusive, Matt Wrack, general secretary of the union NASUWT, said: \"£1.6bn over three years may sound like a lot of money, but it equates to just a few thousand pounds per setting.\"He said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest the system could be overhauled with that amount of funding.Luke Sibieta, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, described the new funding, which is being allocated to SEND from within the Department for Education's budget, as a \"reasonably significant change\".But he said reform would be a \"long and complicated process\", adding that a new funding system would need to be developed \"to ensure resources are targeted across schools to where they are needed\".The government will need to manage that transition carefully to minimise any disruption to existing support for pupils with SEND, he said.Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the changes would mean families get \"tailored support built around their child's individual needs, available on their doorstep\".\"Whatever their background, wherever they live - this government will do right by every child,\" he added.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the reforms would be a \"watershed moment\" for children, and a \"major milestone in this government's mission to make sure opportunity is for each and every child\".Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, she said ministers would not be withdrawing \"effective support\", and stressed that the government would be \"spending more money\", not less, on providing for children with SEND.Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the government's plan lacked clarity on where the new funding comes from. She said families should be given \"cast-iron guarantees\" that no child with an EHCP will lose support.\"This is not money you can find down the back of the sofa,\" she added.Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said any changes to SEND must include better early intervention and universal screening \"so that each child has the best chance to succeed.The National Association of Head Teachers welcomed the \"principle\" of more funding to help support pupils in mainstream schools, but said it would be speaking to school leaders \"to weigh up whether it is sufficient\".\"There will always be some pupils whose needs are so great that they require support in a special school, and it's crucial the government's plans ensure all children get the support they need at the right time in the right setting,\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the union, said.Jon Sparkes, chief executive of learning disability charity Mencap, said the extra funding for more inclusive mainstream schools was \"welcome news\".\"Families must have their children's needs identified early and for them to be given the right help straight away, backed by services fully funded to do the job, and rights underpinned by law,\" she said.Part of the new funding also includes £200m to make every teacher qualified to support pupils with SEND, in what the government called the biggest SEND training offer ever seen in English schools.Kate McGough / BBCHead teacher Claire Robertson says SEND inclusion is about more than just one-to-one support time, and should include lesson planning and classroom designMore teacher training around SEND is something many school leaders have been hoping to see in the government's reforms.Claire Robertson, head teacher of Cherry Fields Primary School in Banbury, said mainstream schools like hers \"have a duty to be as inclusive as we can\".Speaking to BBC News before the latest funding announcement, she said she hoped the White Paper would have a particular focus on developing SEND training for mainstream staff.\"Our staff are wonderful but we need to have access to appropriate training to support our young people,\" she said.Under its proposed reforms, the government said it is also planning to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.Full details of all of the government's planned reforms for schools will be published on Monday.",

I was really shocked and I lost my breath and couldn't quite believe it.\"The actress, who has also appeared in TV dramas Luther and Black Mirror as well as Marvel movies, also thanked her daughter, adding \"you are my greatest teacher\".PA MediaWunmi Mosaku and Jack O'Connell have won praise for their roles in the musical horror film Sinners, which also won a Bafta for best original screenplayMosaku was inspired to become an actress after watching the 1980s musical film Annie \"every single day after school\", she recently told The Graham Norton Show.When she shared her hopes with family, they asked her how she was going to achieve the ambition, prompting her to do an online search on the movie cast.She then became aware about drama schools after finding out Salford-born actor Albert Finney, who played Daddy Warbucks in the film, had trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) in London.Mosaku later followed his footsteps by taking a £3.50 journey on the Megabus for a successful audition there.She was also a member of the Manchester Girls Choir for 11 years, describing her time there as \"one of my most precious memories\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

The Ministry of Defence said an investigation was under way.Prince William said Wilde's \"warmth and compassion were unmistakable\" when he met her while she was serving with the Welsh Guards in March 2024.\"She served with courage and distinction as a medic and sought always to help others,\" he said in a statement on social media.It added: \"I send my heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.\"Colonel William.\"Family handoutLucy Wilde has been described by her brother as \"strength wrapped in softness\"In a statement, Wilde's brother Josh described her as \"strength wrapped in softness\", adding that she had served in the Army with \"courage and pride\" and \"lived with resilience\".\"She adored long walks with her dog, the peace of nature, books that transported her, and the sense of freedom found outdoors,\" he also said.\"She had a warmth and loyalty that was rare. A heart that gave even when she had been hurt.\"More from WiltshireAfter joining the Army eight years ago, Wilde was with the Welsh Guards until December 2025 before moving to the Royal Yorkshire Regiment.In a lengthy tribute, the Welsh Guards said she had \"a rare ability to lift those around her\" and her loss would be felt \"across the battalion and far beyond\".Her former regiment highlighted her bravery when she attended an incident in the Falkland Islands which saw  vehicle overturning and leaving multiple Welsh Guards injured. She received a commendation.\"Lucy was first on the scene and worked relentlessly to treat casualties and ensure every guardsman was accounted for and safe,\" the regiment said.\"Her actions that day were nothing short of outstanding, and she was rightly commended for her courage and professionalism.\"",

Like most Indians, she has only ever hunted for white label bargains in street-side bazaars all her life.However, budget brands like Trends - run by Isha Ambani, heiress to the Reliance Industries retail empire founded by Asia's richest man, Mukesh Ambani - and Tata's Zudio are now offering goods at the same price point as the bazaar, but with a vastly improved shopping experience.In these outlets, most merchandise costs between $4 (£2.90) and $15. \"Plus, the designs are contemporary and there's a growing desire among people to wear branded clothes,\" Pankaj Kumar, a retail analyst at Mumbai-based Kotak Securities, told the BBC.Reliance RetailTrends is run by Isha Ambani, the heiress to the retail arm of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group This explosion in the number of value-conscious yet aspirational consumers, especially in smaller towns, is driving extraordinary bottomline growth in the country's organised fast-fashion industry, led by brands such as Max, Vishaal Mega Mart, Trends and Zudio.Quarterly numbers for Trends are not publicly available, but Zudio's growth has wildly outpaced global high-street titans like Zara and H&M, as well as the Tata Group's own mid-to-premium range fashion brand Westside, in the past few years. Consider these figures: in 2018, Zudio had merely seven stores across the country and clocked $12m in revenue. Westside was a much bigger brand, with 125 stores bringing in around $220m.Today, the tables have completely turned.Zudio's seven stores have expanded to 765, with revenues crossing $1bn by the middle of 2025 - making it the only Indian clothing brand to hold that distinction.Westside on the other hand has doubled its store count, with revenue growing three-fold - but the pace of growth is nowhere near comparable.\"It's a classic bottom-of-the-pyramid strategy - go big by going mass,\" says Kotak Securities, about Zudio's success, adding that pricing has been a key factor, given that \"even affordable fashion is a luxury in India's tier-2 and tier-3 towns\".But what's driving this spending at a time when India's job market has been weak, wages haven't really grown rapidly and overall private consumption, which makes up 60% of GDP, has remained patchy?\"It's very clearly a wallet-shift,\" says Kushal Bhatnagar of Bengaluru-based Redseer Strategy Consultants. \"Consumers are not buying much more than they were; but they've shifted their purchases from mom-and-pop stores to branded outlets.\"This shift is the result of a major push by budget brands to rapidly penetrate zip-codes and go into the deepest pockets of India.And the likes of Zudio and Max have brought about the \"trendification\" of affordable fashion for the first time, appealing to Gen-Z and young millennial buyers, by trawling the latest fads in Paris and Milan. An early partnership between Trent - Zudio's parent brand – and Zara helped it apply the Spanish fast fashion giant's playbook to its growth strategy, says Bhatnagar.Just like Zara, Zudio manages incredibly quick inventory turnaround of just 15 days versus the 45-60 days taken by its rivals.\"In the world of fashion, the speed of inventory is everything,\" says Kumar of Kotak Securities. The quicker new styles hit the shelves, the more frequent are the store visits.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesMost Indians still largely buy unbranded goods from street-side bazaars This growth has, however, come at a cost to local mom-and-pop stores on the high street.They are facing competition not just from budget brands but also from e-commerce websites like Meesho, which aggregates sellers on its digital platform and ships cheap goods across India. It has been growing its bottomline at 35-40% year-on-year.\"When GDP-per-capita begins to go up for a country, branded goods and online shopping naturally becomes a more prominent part of retail,\" says Bhatnagar.But the real challenge now, he says, is to get a \"consumption uplift\", so that along with a shift in wallet-share there's also a growth in the overall market size. India's apparel market is currently estimated to be between $70bn to $100bn. \"We underspend on apparel. Our spend per-capita is much lower than China, US or even Indonesia. In a good year this market should typically grow at 12-15%. We've been at sub-10% growth in the past few years.\"Despite the tepid growth in market size, the rise of fast-fashion is accompanied by growing worries about the sector's ecological impact. The textile industry is the third-largest contributor to dry municipal solid waste in India - after plastics, and paper and cardboard - according to a recent report. And only a quarter of it is recycled.\"While some brands are embedding sustainability into their supply chains, true large-scale change remains distant,\" according to Deloitte, which estimates less than 1% of used clothing is recycled into new garments and recycled fibres globally. For now though, style and savings appear to have trumped concerns about sustainability, with many small-town Indians only just getting on to the fast-fashion bandwagon. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoJaroslav LukivandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianReutersThe US has been building up its military presence near Iran in recent weeksUS President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" in the face of Washington's military build-up in the Middle East, the US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff has said.Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Trump was \"curious\" about Iran's position after he had warned of a limited military strike if a deal was not reached on Tehran's nuclear programme.The US and its European allies suspect Iran of moving towards making a nuclear weapon, which it denies. Within Iran, anti-government protests were staged at several universities over the weekend - the first rallies on such a scale since January's deadly crackdown by the authorities, which saw thousands killed. In his interview with Fox News, Witkoff said: \"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated'... because he [Trump] understands he's got plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated', but why they haven't capitulated.\"\"Why, under this sort of pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power that we have over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess that we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do?'\"\"And yet it's hard to sort of get them to that place,\" Trump's envoy added.Getty ImagesSteve Witkoff was the lead US negotiator during indirect talks with Iran in Switzerland on TuesdayIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday he believed there was still a chance the dispute could be solved diplomatically \"based on a win-win game\". He told CBS News negotiators were working on the elements of a deal.In separate comments two days ago, Araghchi said Tehran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to Witkoff in the next few days.US and Iranian officials discussed Iran's nuclear programme at indirect talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on 17 February. They said afterwards that progress had been made.Oman - who mediated the talks - announced on Sunday that the next round of negotiations was now \"set for Geneva this Thursday\".In a post on X, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also expressed hopes that there would be \"a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal\".The US and Iran have not commented.Despite the reported progress in Geneva, Trump said on Thursday that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal with Iran would be reached or the US would take military action.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence near Iran and in the wider Middle East region.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier has also been deployed, along with destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Scuffles break out at Sharif University in Tehran on SaturdayIn Iran, the BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. They were later seen scuffling with government supporters.Protests were also reported at other universities in Tehran and elsewhere.Iranian media reported demonstrations also took place on Sunday at the Iran University of Science and Technology and Khajeh Nasir Toosi University in Tehran, and at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in north-eastern Iran.In one video the BBC has verified, anti-government protesters raise the Lion and Sun flag - a symbol of Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution - at the Sharif University. People in the crowd chant \"Javid Shah\" (\"long live the king\").Another verified video shows a pro-government crowd holding a counter-protest at the Sharif University in which US and Israeli flags are being burned.Clashes between pro and anti-government crowds are also seen in verified footage filmed at Amirkabir University of Technology.Students from different universities have been gathering to honour thousands of those killed by authorities last month.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 7,015 people during that wave, including 6,508 protesters, 226 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. The latest figures were updated on 15 February.Hrana also said it was investigating 11,744 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".President Trump has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\".Additional reporting by BBC Verify's Emma Pengelly",

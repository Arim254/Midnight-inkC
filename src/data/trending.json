    "body": "\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle final (10:20-11:40) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (13:30-14:50 - re-arranged from Tuesday because of weather)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of the Netherlands' Melissa Peperkamp. The rest of the field were at least nine points behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "5 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykUS Department of Justice/PAEpstein took dozens more flights to the UK than were previously knownEssex Police has said it is assessing information about private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the Epstein files.The BBC understands that while the police is \"assessing\" the information, it would not necessarily lead to a full investigation.Last year a BBC investigation found 87 flights linked to the convicted sex offender had arrived at or departed from UK airports between the early 1990s and 2018.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the New Statesman last week that police \"urgently\" need to re-examine whether Jeffrey Epstein's victims were trafficked within and outside of the UK.An Essex Police spokesperson said: \"We are assessing the information that has emerged in relation to private flights into and out of Stansted Airport following the publication of the US DoJ Epstein files.\"In December, BBC News discovered that three British women who were allegedly trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK alongside other documents related to the convicted sex offender.US lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims told the BBC it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a \"full-scale\" investigation into his activities in the UK.The former PM wrote to the chief police constables and commissioner of the Met, Essex and Thames Valley Police.He added that Stansted, located around 40 miles away from central London, was one of the airports \"where women were transferred from one Epstein plane to another\".Stansted Airport said in a statement: \"All private aircraft at London Stansted operate through independent Fixed Base Operators, which handle all aspects of private and corporate aviation in line with regulatory requirements.\"The airport said that these terminals are \"entirely independent\" and that \"no private jet passengers enter the main airport terminal\". Immigration and customs checks for passengers arriving via private jets are carried out \"directly by Border Force\", it said, adding that it does not \"manage or have any visibility of passenger arrangements on privately operated aircraft\".The Essex Police statement comes as a new national group has been set up to support UK forces that are \"assessing allegations\" following the publication of the Epstein files, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has said.The force previously said it has held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about the allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports with Epstein during his time as the UK's trade envoy.The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.He was dismissed from his role as ambassador in September, after Downing Street said new information had emerged about the depth of this relationship with Epstein.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoPolice accessing Stansted Airport private flights over Epstein ties leads a number of Wednesday's papers. \"Flight logs and emails for Epstein's 'Lolita Express' are being accessed\", the i Paper reports, after allegations women were flown in and out of England. Meanwhile, MPs are weighing up whether to open \"an investigation into Andrew's work as UK trade envoy\", the paper says. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.The Sun reports on Mountbatten-Windsor being faced overnight with \"a criminal probe into sex trafficking claims\". It claims there are at least seven UK police forces on the Epstein case. The former prince has always denied any wrongdoing.Similarly, the Daily Mail covers the \"pressure piling on Andrew\" with claims of a \"fourth police force probe\" into Epstein ties. The Guardian features US civil rights leader Jesse Jackson who died aged 84 on Tuesday morning. The paper remembers the leading Democrat with a quote from Barack Obama saying \"We stood on his shoulders\". Meanwhile, the paper reports that one in nine new homes in England built between 2022 and 2024 could now be at risk of flooding. The Financial Times remembers Jesse Jackson as the leader whose advocacy spanned the death of Martin Luther King Jr in 1968 to the election of Barack Obama in 2008 - featuring an image of the late US civil rights leader taking part in a rally in Washington in 1992. The paper also reports that the UK government has pulled the plug on a \"programme to build frictionless post-Brexit trade border\" after the end of a contract with Deloitte and IBM. The Daily Express leads with unemployment figures hitting 5.2%, and points the finger at Labour's job taxes, which it calls the \"silent killer of inspiration\". The paper reports that one Tory claims \"millions are crying out for the reward of hard work\". The Daily Star leads with Gordon Ramsay's reflections on his tough childhood that he says \"made me a better dad\". Elsewhere on the page, Jesse Jackson is remembered and the countdown for the Cheltenham races begins. A \"Putin Critic\" who says he \"checks his door handle every day\" in fear of nerve agent assassinations is the subject of the exclusive lead story in the Metro. The Russian national and journalist, Roman Dobrokhotov, 42, was \"named as a target at the trial of a Putin spy ring in Britain\" and claims to be \"on Putin's kill list\", the paper reports. The Daily Mirror calls Nigel Farage's new team, which he unveiled yesterday, \"no laughing matter\". The Reform UK leader's new cabinet is \"full of Tories\", the paper says, and whom Labour chair Anna Turley says \"failed Britain before\" and would \"do they same again\". Rachel Reeves is reportedly rejecting requests \"from military chiefs to spend billions more on defence\", the Daily Telegraph says. It reports a £28bn shortfall as being flagged by the Ministry of Defence. Meanwhile, Dame Prue Leith takes the lead image in a outfit made out of \"leaves and stems from the King's private estate\" for the opening night of London Fashion Week. Labour considering dropping their youth wage pledge after \"suggestions the policy is fuelling record youth unemployment\" is the focus of the Times. Business groups say ministers are \"pricing a generation of young people out of the workplace\". The front of the paper also has Dame Prue Leith posing in her London Fashion Week outfit on its front page.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesNine people have been arrested in France following an investigation into the murder of a far-right nationalist student by suspected militants from the far-left.Those detained include a parliamentary assistant for a deputy from the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) party.Quentin Deranque, a 23-year-old maths student, died in hospital on Saturday - two days after being beaten and kicked about the head by a gang of masked young men in Lyon.It happened after a small demonstration by far-right feminists - who Deranque was supposed to be helping protect - at the city's Institute of Political Studies (IEP), commonly known as Sciences-Po. The arrests confirm what has widely been reported: that those suspected of the murder are far-left militants linked to a banned group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard). The most striking news is that among the nine in custody is Jacques-Elie Favrot, a young man who until now has been employed as parliamentary assistant at the National Assembly in Paris for a deputy from LFI.The murder is putting huge pressure on LFI, on its 70 MPs, and on its veteran leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who is a likely contender in next year's presidential election.On Sunday, Mélenchon said his party had \"nothing to do with this story. Those who accuse us are committing a libel.\"We express our consternation, but also our empathy and compassion for [Deranque's] family and friends. We have said dozens of times that we oppose all forms of violence,\" he said.On Monday, state prosecutor Thierry Dran told a news conference that Deranque was kicked and punched by \"at least six\" individuals, and that the post-mortem examination showed fatal damage to his skull and brain.",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris Mason,Political editorandBrian Wheeler,political reporterCivil Service Blog / GOV.UKDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles in three government departmentsThe frontrunner to be the next head of the UK civil service faced allegations from several people about her behaviour when she was a senior diplomat in New York, according to documents seen by the BBC.Former officials have told the BBC that it is \"disingenuous\" for the Cabinet Office to state that there had only been a single official complaint.Dame Antonia Romeo is currently the senior civil servant at the Home Office and is highly regarded by some in Whitehall for her ability to get things done.But claims about her conduct when she was the UK's consul general in New York a decade ago have led critics to question her suitability for the role of cabinet secretary, which would put her at the head of the civil service.The government says three allegations relating to her use of expenses and bullying of staff when she was in New York were investigated and there was \"no case to answer\".The Cabinet Office said the three allegations were from a single complaint, that she had been spoken to about her management style after the complaint had been dismissed, and that no similar claims have been raised in any of her other roles.Sources have told the BBC there had, in fact, been complaints about Dame Antonia's conduct in New York from several people.Sir Matthew Rycroft, who was the UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York when Dame Antonia was consul general and Rupert McNeil, the government's then head of human resources have both said in recent days that there was just one complaint.But a source told the BBC: \"To argue publicly that there was just one complaint is wilfully misleading. They were presented to London in one dossier, but there were multiple complaints.\"In documents setting out the complaints, Dame Antonia is described as behaving in an \"unreasonable\", \"degrading\", and \"demeaning\" way towards staff and of being more interested in promoting her own \"personal brand\" on social media than that of the UK government.\"She's a diplomat, not a D-list celebrity. My 15-year-old, social-media-obsessed, brother is less shameless in his self-promotion,\" reads some contemporaneous testimony.One member of the UK's team described feeling \"emotionally battered\".As the UK's consul general between 2016 and 2017 Dame Antonia's job involved promoting UK trade and business in New York, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum to take Britain out of the EU.The BBC has learned that 47% of staff in New York said they had experienced bullying in the workplace in an annual staff survey  - the highest level ever recorded anywhere in the Foreign Office.It is understood that in most government departments or divisions the figure is usually in low single figures. The survey covered a 12 month period, including three months in which Dame Antonia was in post.Dame Antonia's critics acknowledge her abilities in the documents seen by the BBC, with one saying she was \"smart, dynamic and really talented.\" Another said she was an \"extremely intelligent, innovative thinker\".But there was also criticism of her management style, with one person saying she was  \"very demanding, very disrespectful, very threatening\".\"I'm used to big egos but this was something else. The minute she heard the word 'no' she'd say I'll go to your boss. But it was worse than that. She would go to your boss's boss and your boss's boss's boss,\" they added.Someone else told us: \"If you don't say 'yes' to her she's not only going to screw your career, but she'll screw all of those around you.\"Her approach, it was claimed, \"inflames rather than calms a situation\" and \"creates a culture of fear and anxiety\".The majority of the complaints seen by the BBC were from female members of staff.The allegations were so serious a former ambassador to Japan, Sir Tim Hitchens, was flown to New York to look into it.His work examined allegations of \"bullying behaviour, financial probity, and putting her private objectives above those of the wider Consulate-General or government\".The BBC has been told the Foreign Office's investigation concluded there was a case for Dame Antonia to answer about her behaviour towards colleagues, but there was no case to answer about what was called \"financial probity\" and is understood to refer to expenses.A Whitehall source said: \"The fact that selective excerpts are now being resurfaced, almost a decade on, to substantiate vexatious anonymous briefings from disgruntled individuals is frankly unconscionable.\"An email from the time raised concerns about Dame Antonia's use of social media.It said: \"Antonia's obsession with promoting her personal brand over the work and priorities of HMG has created an untenably tense and bullying atmosphere for all staff\".Staff also reported, as one put it, that Dame Antonia insisted they \"frame articles in Vogue and the New Yorker about her and place them in the Residence guest bathroom directly in the line of sight at all angles so that regardless of, um, how you use the bathroom, you have to stare at a photo of her in a magazine spread staring back at you.\"One former colleague said in an email: \"I'm extremely alarmed that Antonia, who holds one of the highest diplomatic positions here in the United States, seems to be focusing an undue amount on building her personal Twitter brand.\"Government sources say the magazine interviews were arranged by the Foreign Office communications team and it is the role of any diplomat overseas to promote the UK and British brands, including on social media.Dame Antonia has held a string of senior roles since her time in New York and is currently one of three figures sharing the role of cabinet secretary on an interim basis, following the departure of Sir Chris Wormald last week.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"Antonia Romeo is an outstanding leader with 25 years of public service. She has been appointed to three different Permanent Secretary roles and has led hundreds of thousands of public servants to deliver for governments of all stripes.\"As we have repeatedly said, one formal complaint was raised nine years ago which was thoroughly investigated. The allegations were dismissed on the basis that there was no case to answer.\"It is entirely inappropriate to resurface dismissed HR proceedings almost a decade later.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoJoe PikePolitical correspondentGetty ImagesKeir Starmer and his team knew last week that a U-turn on delaying council elections was inevitable, and they knew it would be painful.From my conversations with some of those involved, they sound frustrated, downbeat and a little annoyed.The PM's advisers correctly predicted that Nigel Farage would paint their reversal as a victory for him - after all, ministers were forced to cave ahead of an imminent legal challenge from Reform UK.The alternative may, however, have been even more embarrassing for the government. Imagine their legal arguments being picked apart in court, perhaps a judge criticising their actions, and even Nigel Farage celebrating a major win in front of TV cameras on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice.Allies of Local Government Secretary Steve Reed - who is ultimately responsible for this reversal - argue that their approach shifted because the legal advice changed. But they won't explain how.\"We're trying to make policy while live legal advice is fed in,\" says one official. \"It's never going to be perfect.\"It seems highly likely that ministers were warned that they might lose Reform's court challenge.Even though the case is now not going ahead, the government still faces a significant lawyers' bill, as well as having to pick up Reform's legal costs which are reported to be more than £100,000.Ministers have also committed to helping those councils that will now need to run complex multi-ward elections with just two and half months' notice.The District Councils Network, which represents many of the smaller councils affected, says voters will be \"bewildered\".The fallout from this embarrassment is far from over. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are calling for the government's legal advice to be published - something that is likely to be fiercely resisted in Whitehall.The Lib Dems are also considering using their upcoming 'opposition day' in Parliament next week to try and force the government to reveal what happened.Justifying the delaysMinisters had argued that with local government reorganisation and simplification underway, why hold expensive elections for councils that might not exist in a year or two?A lot of stretched local authorities agreed, but they now face a rush to print ballot papers and prepare polling stations.Labour might have received a political advantage if the election delays had gone ahead.The party currently controls 21 of the 30 English councils where elections were due to be delayed, and opinion polls suggest it may have been difficult to keep hold of all of them.These extra contests may also magnify possible losses for the Conservatives - Kemi Badenoch's party currently holds many of the seats where votes have been reinstated.Reform, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party are likely to be less worried. May 7 could provide opportunities for them to bolster their representation in English local government.Yesterday's shift in policy was both a U-turn, and a humiliation for Local Government Secretary Steve Reed.As to Reform's call for Reed to resign, a government source brushes off the suggestion: \"We're not Manchester United\", they say. \"It's not like we're having one managerial resignation a month.\" ",

    "body": "6 hours agoDearbail JordanBusiness reporterEPAThe European Union (EU) has launched a formal investigation into fast fashion giant Shein over possible breaches of digital law, including the sale of childlike sex dolls.The European Commission (EC), the EU's executive arm, said it will examine what systems the Chinese firm has in place to prevent the sale of illegal products \"including content which could constitute child sexual abuse material\".It will also investigate the \"addictive design\" of Shein's platform and the transparency of the system it uses to suggest products and content to shoppers.Shein said: \"Protecting minors and reducing the risk of harmful content and behaviours are central to how we develop and operate our platform.\"Last year, Shein was reported to French authorities for selling \"sex dolls with a childlike appearance\" on its website.The firm said it removed the products immediately, banned the sellers, and removed the sale of sex dolls \"regardless of appearance\" across its global site. It also said it worked with local and international authorities on investigations into both the buyers and sellers of the childlike sex dolls.The Commission said it will investigate the systems Shein uses to limit the sale of illegal products. It said that would include weapons but declined to specify particular items.It has sent a number of requests for information to Shein in the past and EC spokesperson Thomas Regnier told the BBC's World Business Report that Shein was \"very cooperative\". But the EC said that once there were indications that a platform may have systemic risks for its users, the EC could open proceedings to investigate further.Regnier said the EC was concerned about the \"addictive\" nature of Shein's website, and the \"gamification\" of the platform, including its \"rewards programme\" for consumers.He said that the Commission was not against reward programmes per se, but that online platform algorithms were \"often opaque\".\"You don't know how they're being designed [and] you're not in control of what you see,\" he said.The EC will also examine the transparency of so-called \"recommender systems\" which use a shopper's data to push certain products their way. It said that under the Digital Services Act (DSA), Shein must disclosed the main parameters it uses to recommend products and must provide users with \"at least one easily accessible option\" that is not based on using their data to profile their likely purchases. Opening a formal investigation into a company means that the EC can take \"enforcement steps\" such as fines of up to 6% of a company's global sales. In the most recent figures available, Shein reported $38bn in sales for 2024.A spokesperson for Shein said: \"Over the last few months, we have continued to invest significantly in measures to strengthen our compliance with the DSA. \"These include comprehensive systemic-risk assessments and mitigation frameworks, enhanced protections for younger users, and ongoing work to design our services in ways that promote a safe and trusted user experience,\" it said.",

Although earlier warnings for snow and ice expired on Tuesday morning, the Met Office warned commuters to remain vigilant due to the risk of black ice and slippery conditions.The UKHSA's yellow cold health alert covers all of England except London and the South East. The alert will be in place from 18:00 on Tuesday until 18:00 on Friday.The agency warns that the weather is likely to have \"minor impacts on health and social care services, including increased use of healthcare services and a greater risk to life of vulnerable people\".A yellow weather warning for snow across most of Wales and parts of western England will come into effect at 16:00 on Wednesday and will be in place until 06:00 on Thursday.A separate yellow warning for rain will be in place for much of the south of England from 06:00 on Wednesday until Thursday at 08:00.How to drive safely in icy weatherTuesday has been a mostly dry with some spells of sunshine. But with temperatures only reaching 3C to 7C and a brisk north-westerly wind, it felt colder - particularly in eastern areas where wind the chill made it feel close to freezing.Temperatures are set to fall close to freezing for most of the UK on Wednesday morning. In parts of northern and north-east Scotland, temperatures could fall to -8C. Icy stretches are likely.Weather conditions will become more unsettled again on Wednesday with a band of rain pushing in from the south and west. This could bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow, according to the Met Office. The forecaster said the system is being monitored closely with the potential for further snow warnings.Later in the week, conditions are expected to turn milder, and although further showers are forecast, drier spells in between are also expected.Getty ImagesA flooded playground in the Chertsey area of Surrey, where a flood warning is in placeMeanwhile, 65 flood warnings and 178 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England on Tuesday - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.Two flood alerts were in place in Wales on Tuesday for the lower Severn catchment in Powys, and south Pembrokeshire.Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 flooded.With further heavy rain forecast for southern England and South Wales on Wednesday, and the ground already saturated, more flood warnings or alerts could be issued.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom SymondsNews correspondentPA MediaBaroness Doreen Lawrence has accused former Daily Mail journalist Stephen Wright of stealing information relating to the racist murder of her son, Stephen Lawrence, in 1993Former Daily Mail investigative reporter Stephen Wright has bitterly criticised claims he paid private investigators for information about the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry. Wright told the High Court they were the \"most despicable allegations it is possible to put to any journalist\" and that the claims were \"utter nonsense\".Giving evidence at the privacy case brought by Lawrence's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, against the Mail's publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), Wright said he was proud of the work he had done to campaign for her son's killers to be brought to justice.Baroness Lawrence accuses Wright and the newspaper publisher of using unlawful methods to research five articles about the case of her son's racially motivated murder in 1993, based on evidence from several private investigators.Baroness Lawrence is one of a number of high-profile figures, including Prince Harry  and Sir Elton John, who are suing ANL for \"grave breaches of privacy\". Allegations include phone tapping over a 20-year period.ANL has strongly denied the claims.At the High Court, barrister David Sherborne, representing Baroness Lawrence, questioned Wright about whether the Daily Mail's reporting was partly motivated by a belief that the Lawrence family was benefiting financially from the case. \"I have worked tirelessly for 25 years to help the Lawrence family get justice for their son,\" Wright, a veteran Daily Mail staffer, responded.\"Mr Sherborne you should be ashamed of yourself ... given what Mr and Mrs Lawrence went through I wouldn't begrudge them any money.\"Stephen, aged 18, was stabbed by a gang while waiting at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London. The Metropolitan Police's failures to properly investigate the five prime suspects in the case became notorious and led to the force being branded \"institutionally racist\" by a landmark public inquiry in 1999.The Lawrences received £320,000 in compensation in 2000 for police failures.Two men were were found guilty of murdering Stephen after a trial in 2012, but the other suspects have not been convicted.The Daily Mail campaigned on the Lawrence family's behalf, running a famous front page in 1997 naming the five prime suspects in Stephen's murder.Family handout/PAStephen Lawrence was 18-years-old when he was killed in 1993Baroness Lawrence said in a previous case statement she believed the Mail was on her son's side but now felt she had been \"played for a fool\", alleging private phone calls and conversations were secretly recorded by investigators.One of the investigators, Gavin Burrows, previously said in a witness statement he worked for the Daily Mail in phone tapping and \"blagging\" private information. He has since retracted this statement, claiming his signature was forged. Wright told the court the reason he mentioned the retracted claims in his own statement was because \"for four years I've lived under a cloud of the most despicable allegations it's possible to put to any journalist.\"\"Of course I had to respond to it. To deny it.\" Wright also strongly denied allegations he met private investigator Jonathan Rees and corrupt police officers in Thornton Heath pubs to pay them for information for stories.Wright said in his witness statement he spoke with John Ross, an ex-police officer sacked for misconduct, who was a \"very good tipster\" he took to lunch once or twice a year to maintain contact. He however denied paying serving police officers for information.Wright later called an allegation of paying a private investigator to \"blag\" information from Lady Lawrence \"absolute nonsense\".Further questions were raised about records showing Wright repeatedly commissioning private investigator firm ELI (Express Locate International) to obtain information. The former Daily Mail journalist said it was for legal searches of the electoral roll and land registry, which were difficult to obtain in-house. However, Sherborne produced emails in court indicating the Mail newspapers had provided access to the electoral roll and phone directory for journalists' research.He said reporters turned to ELI because it specialised in unlawful methods for obtaining ex-directory phone numbers and other personal information.The case is set to continue throughout February.",

President Donald Trump had earlier said he believed Iran wanted to make a deal.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.Before Tuesday's talks at the residence of Oman's ambassador in the Swiss city, Iran stated that it would focus on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the US. Washington has previously indicated it wanted to discuss other issues as well, such as Iran's missile development.It was not immediately known what range of issues were discussed in Geneva but a US official told the BBC: \"Progress was made, but there are still a lot of details to discuss. The Iranians said they would come back in the next two weeks with detailed proposals to address some of the open gaps in our positions.\"When asked about the talks in an interview with Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said: \"In some ways, it went well; they agreed to meet afterwards. But in other ways, it was very clear that the president has set some red lines that the Iranians are not yet willing to actually acknowledge and work through.\"Framing the talks as \"very important\", US President Donald Trump had earlier said he would be \"indirectly\" involved and suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate. \"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that Iran learned the consequences of a tough posture in talks last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites. \"We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,\" he said, referring to the stealth bombers that carried out the bombings. \"I hope they're going to be more reasonable.\"Trump's threats come amid a US military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks. The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, which could arrive in the region within the next three weeks.Speaking on Tuesday, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded to Trump's threats of military action by saying: \"More dangerous than an aircraft carrier is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea.\"He says the US's army is the strongest army in the world. The 'strongest army in the world' may sometimes receive such a blow that it cannot get back up.\"Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a \"wrong and foolish thing to do\".In addition to the Abraham Lincoln's arrival, BBC Verify has also tracked an increase of US destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets in the region.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X he was in Geneva to \"achieve a fair and equitable deal\".\"What is not on the table: submission before threats,\" Araghchi said.ReutersThe US military released an image of the Lincoln carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea in FebruaryIran has responded to the US build-up with its own show of force. On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that reaching a deal with Tehran would be \"very difficult\".\"I think that there's an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement... but I don't want to overstate it either,\" Rubio said during a visit to Hungary. \"It's going to be hard.\"Additional reporting by Ghoncheh Habibiazad, BBC Persian",

    "body": "Vonn was the Olympic downhill champion in 2010 and had been hoping for a fairytale ending to her illustrious career.She retired from the sport in 2019 as the most decorated female skier at the time, having suffered several serious leg injuries.After having a partial right knee replacement, she announced her shock return to the sport in 2024.Since then, she had achieved eight podium finishes on the World Cup circuit, including two golds, and had been tipped to win a medal at her fifth and final Olympics.But despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in Switzerland in the last World Cup race before the Games, she was determined to take to the course in Cortina where she had enjoyed so much success.Reflecting on the crash in an Instagram, external post on Sunday, she said she was \"looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more\".\"When I think back on my crash, I didn't stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences. I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk,\" she added.\"Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.\"I was willing to risk and push and sacrifice for something I knew I was absolutely capable of doing. I will always take the risk of crashing while giving it my all, rather than not ski to my potential and have regret. \"I never want to cross finish line and say,\"what if?\" And to be perfectly honest, I was stronger physically in that moment than I have been often in the past.\"",

    "body": "Viral face depuffing tricks - skin experts reveal if they work10 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesFrom plunging your face into bowls of ice water to rolling frozen tools across your cheeks, social media is full of quick fixes promising to depuff your face in minutes.While these techniques look convincing on screen, dermatologists say many of them are misunderstood, overhyped and at best, temporary. Consultant dermatologist Dr Aiza Jamil says facial puffiness is usually caused by fluid retention and common triggers include high salt and alcohol intake, allergies and lack of sleep. Dr Tina Tian, also a consultant dermatologist explains most viral hacks fall into three categories - cold exposure, massage and temporary tightening effects.They can \"genuinely reduce visible swelling and provide relief but the key word is temporary - they won't permanently change facial structure\". So what actually helps with facial puffiness, and what's more myth than miracle? Here's the truth about three common treatments.1. Cold therapy Getty ImagesCold exposure causes blood vessels to constrictIf you've ever hovered over a sink debating whether to dunk your face into a bowl of ice water, you're not alone. The \"ice facial\" has become a social media rite of passage and is half beauty hack, half endurance challenge.Tina explains the appeal comes from the fact that the \"cold exposure causes blood vessels to constrict, which can reduce swelling\".This is the logic behind ice facials, cryo globes and refrigerated sheet masks but Tina says you don't need a dramatic ice plunge to get the benefit as a chilled compress or even a splash of cold water can do the job. Aiza adds that it can give you a \"slightly tighter, fresher appearance, particularly in the morning\" but results are temporary and the effect \"lasts hours rather than days\". Tina says there's also a fine line between refreshing and overdoing it as \"very aggressive ice exposure can irritate sensitive skin or trigger rosacea, so keep it gentle\". 2. Facial rollers Getty ImagesIt's important to use the tools gently, says TinaOnce niche spa tools, facial rollers and gua sha stones are now bathroom staples for many of us. Promoted as sculpting devices, they've built a reputation for lifting and contouring but Aiza says they \"do not permanently tighten skin, change skin structure, or remove fat\". She adds that it's best to see them as a \"soothing tool\".They can however help with reducing facial puffiness temporarily. \"A gentle massage encourages lymphatic drainage and reduces fluid pooling if used regularly,\" Tina says. When you roll or glide these products across the skin, you're helping stagnant fluid move away from the face and towards the lymph nodes, where it can drain naturally. Tina adds that cooling the tools can boost the results so some people choose to keep them in the fridge. If done properly, it's unlikely to cause you any harm, but Tina warns that \"too much pressure can cause bruising or broken capillaries, so be gentle\".3. Caffeine creamsGetty ImagesYou've probably seen caffeine eye cream everywhere - it's recommended by influencers, stacked in skincare aisles and tucked into \"morning routine\" videos promising instant bright eyes. The skin around the eyes is especially prone to swelling because fluid can collect there easily.Unlike many beauty trends, Tina says this one does have some evidence behind it. \"Caffeine is a mild vasoconstrictor [narrows blood vessels], so caffeine-containing eye creams can genuinely reduce puffiness,\" she says. Caffeine temporarily shrinks blood vessels and less dilation means less visible swelling. Aiza adds that it can help \"reduce fluid retention and some under-eye darkness\". If you're going to use an eye cream, Tina recommends looking for one with hydrating ingredients alongside the caffeine as that supports skin quality. She adds that you can also keep the cream in the fridge or even \"apply it with the back of a cold spoon\". Aiza says DIY alternatives like using a cold spoon or chilled tea bags \"works similarly by temporarily reducing swelling and soothing skin\".Tina agrees and says these methods follow the same principle \"but can provide a lesser effect\".While caffeine eye cream can help reduce puffiness, Tina says it's more important to focus on the cause. \"Reduce evening salt and alcohol, treat allergies properly, prioritise sleep and slightly elevate your head at night. Most puffiness isn't a medical issue and will settle on its own but Tina says that \"if it's persistent, worsening, painful or associated with other symptoms such as breathlessness or swelling elsewhere in the body, it should be assessed medically\".

    "body": "Kim Cattrall marries fiancé she met on BBC radio show2 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporter Getty ImagesSex and the City actress Kim Cattrall has married Russell Thomas, almost a decade after they met when she was a guest on a radio show at the BBC, where he worked.The actress shared an image of them kissing on Instagram, after People reported that they had tied the knot at London's Chelsea Old Town Hall.People said the ceremony was attended by 12 family members and close friends, reflecting their \"preference for intimacy and authenticity\".Liverpool-born Cattrall, who is most famous for playing Samantha Jones in the popular HBO comedy-drama, met Thomas in 2016 when she appeared on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.She recently told the Times: \"We've been together almost 10 years now. And we've had a blast. We've just had so much fun.\"The newspaper said they met in April 2016 when she appeared on Woman's Hour to read diary entries written during a bout of \"crippling insomnia\", which had forced her to pull out of a play at London's Royal Court.She said Thomas has been \"erroneously reported\" as being a sound engineer.While she did not expand on his exact role, she said: \"He was an actor originally. He's had an incredibly interesting life and really done it on his terms. He's a bit of a rebel, which I love,\" she said.Getty ImagesKim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon, pictured in 2000, starred in six series and two films of Sex and the City Sex and the City ran for six series from 1998 to 2004 and generated two spin-off films. It co-starred Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.Cattrall won a Golden Globe for her role in 2003, and received three other nominations for the show, along with five primetime Emmy nominations. Parker, Nixon and Davis appeared in spin-off series And Just Like That from 2021, while Cattrall just made a brief appearance in the final episode of season two in 2023.She reportedly did not play a greater part in the spin-off because of a strained relationship with the show and her cast-mates.Her other acting work includes the BBC's Bafta-nominated series The Witness for the Prosecution in 2016, the 2022 revival of Queer as Folk, 1987 film Mannequin and the original Police Academy film in 1984. Her stage work includes Sweet Bird of Youth in 2013 at London's Old Vic and Private Lives on Broadway in 2011.",

    "body": "The last supermoon of 2025 dazzled bright in the night sky on Thursday night.Appearing brighter and larger than a normal full Moon, the third supermoon of the year was also spotted by some in the UK with an atmospheric phenomenon called a halo.This halo even has its own folklore - 'Ring around the Moon, rain real soon'.It was a perfect opportunity for sky gazers around the world, along with the BBC's Weather Watchers, to get capture some stunning images. Supermoon's occur because the Moon's orbit around Earth is not perfectly circular, but slightly elliptical - meaning it is sometimes closer to us than at other times.When the Moon is in \"perigee\" - or near its closest point to Earth - and that coincides with a full Moon, fully illuminated by the sun's light, we call it a supermoon.The Moon appears larger and brighter in the night sky.Clear skies will also mean a great view of the Moon but sometimes you might also see a ring around the Moon.Known as a 22 degree halo, this occurs when there is a layer of very high, ice cloud in the sky.Light from the Moon passes through the ice crystals where it bends and reflects creating the ring effect.The presence of a the ice cloud in the sky can be an indicator of an approaching weather system and hence why the folklore suggests 'rain real soon'.Early on Friday morning high ice cloud moved in across southern areas of England where the halo was spotted.So, rain real soon?Yes, rain will be spreading to most parts of the UK during Friday with a strengthening wind.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterChancellor Rachel Reeves will not face an investigation by the prime minister's ethics adviser over whether she broke the ministerial code with her pre-Budget interventions.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had asked Sir Laurie Magnus to launch an inquiry arguing that Reeves had breached rules which require ministers to be open and candid.He accused her of failing to give Parliament \"the full and truthful picture\" of the nation's finances in the lead-up to the Budget.Reeves has rejected claims she misled the public, insisting she had been \"upfront\" about the choices she faced.In the build up to the Budget on 26 November, the chancellor had repeatedly warned that a downgrade to the UK's economic productivity forecasts meant the finances were in a worst state than previously thought. However, she did not make clear that the Office for Budget Responsibility had reported better-than-expected tax receipts which offset the reduction in productivity growth.Opposition parties including Reform and the Conservatives have suggested Reeves deliberately presented an overly-negative picture in order to justify further tax rises to pay for welfare increases. In his letter to Sir Laurie, Farage said: \"The chancellor conducted a sustained public and media campaign portraying the public finances as being in a state of collapse in order to prepare political ground for approximately £30bn of tax increases which, on the OBR's own numbers, were discretionary policy choices rather than unavoidable fiscal necessity.\"The British people are now facing the heaviest tax burden in generations on the basis of what increasingly looks like a sustained misrepresentation of the true fiscal position.\" In his reply to Farage explaining his decision not to launch an investigation, Sir Laurie said: \"It is not within my remit to consider the collective actions of government departments or individuals other than ministers.\"He added that he was also not able to look into \"questions of market regulation\" which are the responsibility of the Financial Conduct Authority FCA). Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride had already asked the FCA to investigate \"possible market abuse\" over pre-Budget leaks.Measures including a freezing of income tax thresholds, a pay-per-mile levy on electric vehicles and a tourist tax were all leaked ahead of the Budget. \"Confidential market sensitive information appears to have been spun, leaked and misused - and markets, businesses and families have paid the price,\" Sir Mel said.The FCA has said it has not begun an inquiry and that the way the government communicates is \"a matter for Parliament through its accountability mechanisms\".It has requested the details of a leak inquiry launched by the Treasury earlier this week.Speaking to a committee on Tuesday, a senior official at the Office for Budget Responsibility said he did not believe the chancellor had been misleading when she said, ahead of the Budget, that the state of the public finances was \"very challenging\".Prof David Miles said that despite the better-than-expected tax receipts the chancellor still faced \"very difficult choices\". He also said the OBR had not found Budget leaks to the media \"helpful\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoChris PageBBC News Ireland correspondentAn excavation team said it has found evidence of a burial ground at the site of the former institution for unmarried mothers and their children in Tuam in County Galway.The agency began the work in July, with the aim of finding and identifying as many remains as possible.The institution at Tuam came to international attention in 2014, after local historian Catherine Corless discovered there were 796 death certificates for children and babies who died there, but no burial records.The Office of the Director of Authorised Intervention, Tuam (ODAIT) has published its fourth regular update.It said it found \"graves of child or infant size\" at an area on the western edge of the site, where excavations have been carried out under a tent.It corresponded to an area labelled as \"burial ground\" on historical maps of the site.ODAIT said: \"Despite these historical references, there were no surface or ground level indications of the potential for a burial ground at this location prior to excavation.\"The presence of burials at this location has now been confirmed.\"The layout and size of the graves is consistent evidence that, at this part of the site, there is a burial ground from the time of the operation of the mother-and-baby institution.\"The institution was open from 1925 until 1961.ODAIT said it recovered four more sets of human remains in the same area, further to the seven which it had found in its previous update last month.It said \"initial assessments\" indicated that all eleven remains were of infants and they had been in coffins.Further analysis is being carried out on the remains.The excavations under the tent are being carried out by machine and by hand.The area is about 100m from another part of the site where investigators from a government inquiry found \"significant quantities\" of remains in underground chambers in 2017.The Director of Authorised Intervention, Daniel MacSweeney, is leading the team.He has previously worked for the International Committee of the Red Cross in operations to recover missing people.He told the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ that the confirmation that infant remains were present was \"very important\".Mr MacSweeney said that 160 people had made contact with a view to giving DNA samples to help identify the bodies.He expressed hope that more would now follow, saying: \"I know from experience that sometimes the discovery of remains can be a catalyst for people to come forward.\"The institution at Tuam was owned by Galway County Council and run by a religious order, the Bon Secours Sisters.The order has previously acknowledged that children and infants were \"buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way\", and apologised.It has contributed £2.14m towards the cost of the excavation.Galway County Council also apologised for \"failing mothers and children\" after the inquiry report in 2021.The excavation is expected to continue until 2027, with follow-up work expected to last several more years.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJames DelaneyBBC ScotlandBBCScaffolding surrounding the hotel on George IV Bridge may not be fully removed until 2027On one of the busiest tourist streets in the heart of Scotland's historic capital sits a monolith of scaffolding.For five years Radisson's G&V Hotel, on the corner of Edinburgh's Royal Mile and George IV Bridge, has been a plastic-wrapped eyesore. Travellers cannot book rooms, pedestrians are squeezed through walkways, and businesses have abandoned the building.Remedial work started in 2020 and was only expected to last a few months, but now fed-up residents have been told the scaffolding could remain until 2027.Sir Robert McAlpine (SRM), the main contractor, says it will be \"towards the end\" of 2026 before the first sections of the frame can be dismantled.Edinburgh's council leader Jane Meagher has called it a \"blight\" on the area, while heritage campaigners say the work is \"extremely disruptive\".What is going on with this seemingly endless project?Radisson HotelsUnwrapped - how the hotel appears scaffold-free on the Radisson websiteThe 136-bedroom hotel was built on the site of the former Lothian Regional Council offices in 2009.Estimates from when it first opened under the Missoni Hotel banner, put the cost of construction at about £30m.Work on the building started shortly after the start of the Covid pandemic with the hotel itself closed to guests since 2022.Part of the road and a large section of pavement leading up to the corner of the Royal Mile have been left out of action by the development.Pedestrians going to and from the Lawnmarket and Victoria Terrace have been forced single-file into a narrow, covered walkway.Seafood restaurant Ondine quit the building and moved to St Andrews in Fife in 2024.In a statement, its operators said building work had forced them to alter the restaurant's appearance, adding that \"customers deserved better\".It is also home to restaurant chain Pizza Express – which has hung large banners on the scaffold to remind customers it is still open.GoogleGoogleThe G&V Hotel under construction in September 2008Work on the hotel began in 2020, not long after the start of the Covid pandemicAn update to the council's transport and environment committee in January this year suggested that the process of \"uncovering\" the façade would begin in February, with a full removal by the end of the year.But SRM has said that will not happen, citing \"extremely complex\" construction issues for the delay.\"We anticipate starting to dismantle sections of the scaffold towards the end of next year, with further improvements continuing thereafter,\" they said.\"We are working closely with all parties to ensure we deliver an improved site for the community.\"Rowan Brown, director of heritage body the Cockburn Association, said the work had added to the city's reputation of being \"slow\" for development.She said those involved in the project had a \"public duty\" to minimise disruption and should incorporate the work into the city's design.She said: \"It is making the pedestrian experience in that part of town really difficult.\"I don't understand why there is not some attempt to bring it into the streetscape or create something more artistic and avant-garde.\"Pedestrians have been forced to walk down a narrow covered walkway on part of the streetA project spokesperson said work on \"solutions to aesthetically improve the site\" was ongoing.They added: \"We understand the frustrations felt by local residents and businesses.\"This has been a lengthy and protracted process, reflecting the complexity and scale of the remedial work required, however we are focused on completing this essential work as soon as is practicable.\"Ms Meagher said the local authority would \"continue to put pressure\" on those involved to finish the project.She said: \"This scaffolding has been a blight for years, and I share the frustration of residents and local businesses over these continued delays.\"However, I also appreciate that the contractor has a responsibility to make the building safe and that this restoration has proved to be hugely complex.\"",

We had volunteers that came together to provide that emotional support, a bit of hand holding, and at times like this, that's what's mainly needed,\" he said.Food supplies arrived at the Pakistan Community Centre on Friday morningJohn Morley, 86, lives in the evacuation zone and stayed overnight with his daughter in Allestree.He told the BBC he was about to put his feet up for a sleep at about 13:30 when a police officer knocked on his door, telling him he needed to evacuate his home.\"I grabbed my tablets, my coat and umbrella, and that was it,\" he said.\"I'm OK, it's just an experience.

    "body": "'It's worse than Covid,' says principal as 170 pupils off sick in one day4 hours agoGerry BradleyandAuryn Cox,BBC News NIBBCEbrington Primary School principal Brian Guthrie said the children have been affected by a range of illnessesThe principal of a County Londonderry school has said it is like \"being back in Covid times\" after 170 pupils were off sick on one day alone.Brian Guthrie of Ebrington Primary School said some children had to attend hospital and a small number were admitted for treatment last week.Confirmed flu cases among adults and children across Northern Ireland have more than trebled in the last two weeks, rising from 273 to 954, official figures show.Mr Guthrie said classroom assistants at his school were also absent because of illness.\"It's not just been flu, it's been stomach bugs, very sore throats and illnesses in other ways as well but over the course of last week, it was very, very challenging with the number of pupils and staff off,\" Mr Guthrie told BBC's North West Today programme.\"It took me back to 2020, to be quite honest, the attendance was actually worse last week than it would have been at any of the worst points, if you like, back in Covid times so, yeah, it was a bit of a shock.\"The impact of the high levels of absence, Mr Guthrie said, meant teachers were not able to carry out new learning in terms of literacy and numeracy.\"It was hitting the younger children more at the start of last week but towards the end of the week, we noticed that it was the upper end of school, our P5-to-P7s, where we were seeing a higher absence rate but at the start of last week, it was more primary one, primary two,\" he said.'Most severe flu outbreak in a decade'Seasonal illnesses, including flu, rise every winter - but experts have predicted this year's flu season could be the worst in a decade.It is affecting young people in particular and a children's doctor in Belfast said it is the worst influenza outbreak she has seen.In the week ending 30 November, under-fives had the highest number of confirmed flu cases of any age group, according to the latest data published by the Public Health Agency, (PHA).Over the same period five to 14-year-olds had the highest positivity rate (54.2%) meaning although fewer of them were tested - those that were tested were more likely to have the flu.Getty ImagesDirector of Public Health at the PHA Dr Joanne McClean said most children who get the flu will not need to be admitted to hospital. She added the likelihood of a child needing hospital treatment is reduced by about 70% if they get the vaccine.The PHA is responsible for the roll-out of flu vaccines in schools across Northern Ireland, of which there are about 1,200 covered by the programme.Dr McClean told The Nolan Show about 40 schools in Northern Ireland have not been visited by the vaccination programme yet.\"Most of them will have had a visit by next week,\" she said. \"At the minute, there are some schools who are scheduled after the Christmas holidays.\"She added the PHA is going to follow up with those schools to see if anything can be done to get the vaccines to them quickly and that delivering vaccine programmes through schools ensures a higher uptake. \"As director of public health, it would be great if we could get all the schools done in September, as soon as the vaccine arrives,\" she said.\"But there are so many schools, we have to agree the times with the schools. They have to find a date that suits them and we have to get nurses in then to administer the vaccine.\"'Flu uptake among children disappointing' Vaccination rates among children across all age ranges remain below 50%, according to the PHA's figures.Only about one in four preschool children have had the flu vaccine so far, while about one in three post-primary children have.Dr McClean said the current data is incomplete but it suggests the uptake among school age children will be similar to last year. \"I would prefer the uptake was 85-90%. I'd prefer if everyone got it,\" she said.\"So, of course I'm disappointed by that.\"Preschool children (2–4): 25.8% Primary school children (P1–P7): 44.7% Post-primary children (Year 8–12): 30.3%Who is eligible for a flu vaccine?In Northern Ireland, the flu vaccine is free for all pre-school children aged two and over, as well as all children at primary school and all children in Years 8 to 12 in secondary school.People aged 65 and over, pregnant women, those with underlying health conditions, care-home residents and health and social care workers and are also eligible for free vaccines.Vaccines can be accessed through GPs, community pharmacies, school programmes and at local Trust clinics.People who are not eligible for free vaccines can still pay to get them from pharmacies which offer vaccination services.Liam Bradley, a community pharmacist in Derry, said the demand for the flu vaccine this year has been greater than last year.\"Every pharmacy is allocated a certain quota of vaccines and we had used our quotas in all our branches and we have ordered more,\" he said.\"There may be temporary shortages of vaccines because the pharmacies have used up their quota but the Department of Health would be trying to ensure that everybody gets the vaccine.\"He said it takes about seven to 10 days for the vaccine to give people protection against flu.",

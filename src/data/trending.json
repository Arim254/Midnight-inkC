    "body": "Supporters hoping to attend next year's World Cup final face paying thousands of pounds for the cheapest ticket.Fans' group Football Supporters Europe has said it is \"astonished\" by Fifa's \"extortionate\" pricing strategy, and called for ticket sales to be \"halted immediately\".The England Supporters' Travel Club (ESTC) said it was a \"slap in the face\" for supporters.Fifa has not yet commented on its pricing decisions.BBC Sport understands tickets for the final in MetLife Stadium, New York, are in three tiers:'Supporter value tier' at £3,119 ($4,185).'Supporter standard tier' at £4,162 ($5,560), 'Supporter premium tier' is £6,615 ($8,860)Tickets to Fifa's showpiece event are as much as seven times more expensive than the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with the lowest price ticket at that event costing £450.There are no concessions across any of its tickets for children or other groups.And, in a departure from recent tournaments, group stage games are priced based on the perceived popularity of the teams involved, rather than at a flat rate. This means, for example, England fans face paying more than Scotland. Fifa has not provided details yet on how this \"popularity\" has been determined.In Qatar, group stage fixtures had set prices of £68.50, £164.50 and £219.But for England's match against Croatia on 17 June, tickets cost £198, £373 or £523. England v Ghana is £164, £320 and £447, with England v Panama £164, £346 and £462.Scotland's first two group games are cheaper than England's. Against Haiti the prices will be £134, £298 or £372, with Morocco set as £163, £320 and £447. The final group game against Brazil is priced the same as England v Croatia.Quarter-finals for all teams are £507, £757 and £1,073, with the semi-finals £686, £1,819 and £2,363.For the entire tournament through to the final, it will cost about £5,225 for one person to go to all eight matches, up to £8,580 in the mid-price range, or £12,357 for the top tier.In 2022, it would have cost £1,466, £2,645 or £3,914, though that was for seven games rather than eight.The details emerged as the main ticket ballot opened on Thursday afternoon.On Monday, members of national supporters' clubs will get the chance to enter a random draw for individual games, or to follow their team through to the final. There are about 4,000 tickets for each game available through the official supporters' groups. All other tickets are allocated through the ballot process, other than those held back by Fifa for corporate partners. Dynamic pricing is not being used in the main or national association ballots.FSE explained why it was calling on Fifa to stop the ticket sale process, believing it needs to rethink the pricing policy. \"In the price tables gradually and confidentially released by Fifa, tickets allocated to national associations...are reaching astronomical levels,\" it said in a statement.\"Adding insult to injury, the lowest price category will not be available to the most dedicated supporters through their national associations, as Fifa chose to reserve the scarce number of category four tickets to the general sales, subject to dynamic ticket pricing.\"For the first time in World Cup history, no consistent price will be offered across all group stage games. Instead, Fifa is introducing a variable pricing policy dependent on vague criteria such as the perceived attractiveness of the fixture.\"Fans of different national teams will therefore have to pay different prices for the same category at the same stage of the tournament, without any transparency on the pricing structure enforced by Fifa.\"England fan group the ESTC said: \"These prices are a slap in the face to supporters who support their team outside of the flagship tournament that appears every four years.\"A game for supporters, loyalty has been thrown out of the window and supporters of the participating nations have been completely let down.\"England fan Luke Buxton told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt the prices were \"absolutely outrageous\".\"It's a big betrayal to the most dedicated fans of every nation that's following their side at the World Cup next summer,\" he added.\"We were planning on going to the group stages initially, then coming home, then flying out for the knockouts. Ideally the round of 16 but it may be too expensive. So the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final. \"However, with these ticket prices coming today, I am not sure I am going to make the knockout stages at all now.\"Scotland fan John Wallan told BBC Radio 5 Live he was trying to work out how he could still take his family. \"I am going, that is definite,\" he said. \"But I have two children as well. They are 19 and 12, so everything has been ramped up. \"I think for a family it will be £15,000-£20,000. I would love to take the kids because it may not happen for another 30 years. \"We've not booked anything yet. We are still deciding if it is one, three or four of us that go.\"It is not yet clear if fans who are successful in their application for 'follow your team' tickets will have the whole amount taken off their credit cards in January.If their team is knocked out, a refund for the unattended matches would be issued to the card.There will not be any dynamic pricing in this sale, but prices are likely to be considerably higher if fans try to buy off Fifa's resale site following this phase.",

It led to what some saw as the unjustified cancellation of a prize-winning writer and teacher - but to others, was a long overdue reckoning for the world of publishing. It grew into a culture war about race, class, and who has the right to say what.\nAnatomy of a Cancellation explores a range of different perspectives to consider how people now view one of the most controversial literary rows in recent memory.\nPresenter: Katie Razzall\nProducer: Charlotte McDonald\nAdditional production: Octavia Woodward\nProduction co-ordinators: Sophie Hill and Katie Morrison\nSound design and mix: James Beard\nStory editing: Meara Sharma\nSeries producer: Matt Willis\nSenior news editor: Clare Fordham\nCommissioning executive: Tracy Williams\nCommissioning editor: Dan Clarke\nIt was a BBC Long Form Audio production for Radio 4.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

In an interview for Politico, Trump expanded on his administration’s new U.S. security strategy, which warned that Europe faces “civilisational erasure” unless it changes its migration policies.  \nIn today’s episode, Sarah and Anthony unpack Trump’s views, and analyse how far the president is willing to interfere with America’s traditional allies.\nThe U.S. president also used the interview to expand on his vision behind healthcare reform, after being criticised for having no plan.   As Congress races to beat a fast-approaching deadline that would see premiums rise sharply for millions of Americans, the president blames Democrats for the stalemate in Congress while promising to end subsidies for insurance companies.  Does Trump have a plan to reform healthcare that will make it cheaper for Americans? \nAnd, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case on the future of birthright citizenship, following an executive order signed by Donald Trump in January.  The president wants to end birthright citizenship for those born to parents who are in the country illegally.  Hear why he thinks the law needs to be changed, and what it should mean to be an American citizen.\nHOSTS: \n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "35 minutes agoRianna CroxfordInvestigations correspondent The former chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch is now fit to stand trial on sex- trafficking and prostitution charges after spending months in hospital, prison officials say.Mike Jeffries was declared \"mentally incompetent\" by a court in May and said to be suffering with dementia and late onset of Alzheimer's disease. A judge ordered him to be treated for up to four months to see if he was likely to regain competency.US prosecutors now say that medical experts have found him competent to stand trial.Mr Jeffries was arrested and charged last October along with his British partner, Matthew Smith, 61, and their alleged middleman, James Jacobson, 72. All three deny the allegations.Mr Jeffries, 81, was released from FMC Butner - a federal prison in North Carolina for men with special health needs - in late November, according to court documents.Writing to Judge Nusrat Choudhury, prosecutors said that prison officials had concluded that Mr Jeffries was \"able to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him and to assist properly in his own defense\".In a court hearing on Thursday, assistant US attorney Megan Farrell US said this followed an assessment by a neuropsychologist and psychologist.A final competency hearing will be set for early 2026 with prosecutors requesting a trial date in October next year, the court heard.The former fashion executive and two others were  charged with running an international sex-trafficking and prostitution business from at least 2008-2015.All three have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.Federal prosecutors accused them of using their money and influence to prey on vulnerable men for their own sexual gratification and said they used force, fraud and coercion to make aspiring models engage in \"violent and exploitative\" sexual acts.Their arrests followed a 2023 BBC documentary and ongoing podcast series  that revealed the trio had been at the centre of a sophisticated operation scouting young men for sex around the world while Mr Jeffries was chief executive of Abercrombie & Fitch.In March, a court ruled that Abercrombie & Fitch had to pay for Mr Jeffries' criminal defence costs - a figure lawyers say is likely to run into millions - as a result of an indemnification agreement he signed while stepping down in 2014. Then, in May, Brian Bieber, Mr Jeffries' criminal defence lawyer, said his client had been evaluated by doctors who determined he had Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body disease, and the residual effects of a traumatic brain injury requiring around-the-clock care, which was supported by two medical experts.Alongside criminal charges, Mr Jeffries, his partner Matthew Smith and Abercrombie & Fitch have been defending multiple civil lawsuits brought by alleged victims.Earlier this year, the BBC revealed that more than 40 men have now come forward with civil allegations of rape, sexual assault or drugging, accusations Mr Jeffries and Mr Smith \"vehemently deny\".One of the plaintiffs, who asked to remain anonymous as he's been interviewed by the FBI as part of its criminal investigation, said he was shocked and relieved by the latest opinion that Mr Jeffries is fit to stand trial.\"For the first time, it feels like we're now moving toward a future where he must answer for what happened and for what so many of us endured.\"It means the truth could finally be heard in a courtroom, and for survivors, that moment for accountability has been a long time coming.\"I hope the system will finally require him to stand up and face the weight of everything he's spent years avoiding.\"Abercrombie & Fitch did not respond to requests for comment, though it has previously said that it had no knowledge of alleged sexual misconduct or sex trafficking and \"up until the moment that the BBC's reporting was released in October 2023, there was nothing public about the allegations against Jeffries\".It said that new leadership had since transformed the company, and it has \"zero tolerance for abuse, harassment or discrimination of any kind\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentFrench marine archaeologists have discovered a massive undersea wall off the coast of Brittany, dating from around 5,000 BC.They think it could be from a stone age society whose disappearance under rising seas was the origin of a local sunken city myth.The 120-metre (394ft) wall – the biggest underwater construction ever found in France – was either a fish-trap or a dyke for protection against rising sea-levels, the archaeologists believe.When it was built on the Ile de Sein at Brittany's western tip, the wall would have been on the shore-line – between the high and low tide marks. Today it is under nine metres of water as the island has shrunk to a fraction of its former size.The wall is on average 20 metres wide and two metres high. At regular intervals divers found large granite standing stones – or monoliths – protruding above the wall in two parallel lines.It is believed these were originally placed on the bedrock and then the wall built around them out of slabs and smaller stones. If the fish-trap hypothesis is the right one, then the lines of protruding monoliths would have also supported a \"net\" made of sticks and branches to catch fish as the tide retreated.With an overall mass of 3,300 tonnes, the wall must have been the work of a substantial settled community. And to have lasted 7,000 years, it was clearly an extremely solid structure.\"It was built by a very structured society of hunter-gatherers, of a kind that became sedentary when resources permitted.  That or it was made by one of the Neolithic populations that arrived here around 5,000 BC,\" said archaeologist Yvan Pailler.The monoliths that form the basis of the wall are similar to - but predate - the famous menhirs that dot the Brittany countryside and are associated with the Neolithic culture. According to Pailler, there could have been a transmission of know-how on extracting, cutting and transporting the stones between older Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and incoming Neolithic agriculturists.The wall was discovered after local geologist Yves Fouquet studied undersea depth charts drawn up using the latest radar technology. \"Just off Sein I saw this 120-metre line blocking off an undersea valley. It couldn't be natural,\" he told Le Monde newspaper.Archaeologists made their first exploration in summer 2022, but had to wait till the following winter – when the seaweed had died back – before they could map the wall properly.In a paper in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology, the writers conjecture that sites such as this may lie at the origin of local Breton legends of sunken cities. One such lost city – Ys – was believed to lie in the Bay of Douarnenez, just a few kilometres to the east.\"It is likely that the abandonment of a territory developed by a highly structured society has become deeply rooted in people's memories,\" the paper says.\"The submersion caused by the rapid rise in sea level, followed by the abandonment of fishing structures, protective works, and habitation sites, must have left a lasting impression.\"",

The contents - if they hadn't been taken - spilled on the floor, the shelves in disarray and the collections scattered around.\"So it was a pretty devastating scene to discover.\"The items were from the collection of the former British Empire & Commonwealth Museum, which was donated to the Bristol Museum after its liquidation in 2013.Stolen items include military badges and pins from the East India Company. The city council said the archives were broken into twice, with 95% of the stolen items being taken in the second raid.'A significant loss'The council added the CCTV images were from the second incident.\"The theft of many items which carry a significant cultural value is a significant loss for the city,\" Det Con Dan Burgan, of Avon and Somerset Police, said.\"These items, many of which were donations, form part of a collection that provides insight into a multi-layered part of British history, and we are hoping that members of the public can help us to bring those responsible to justice,\" he added.He said so far police have carried out \"significant\" CCTV inquiries, forensic investigations and have been liaising with the victims.The jewellery taken includes necklaces, bangles and rings. Carved figurines and other decorative items are missing as well as items of natural history, including geological specimens. GoogleThe items were taken from an archive building While the artefacts were not on display in the Bristol Museum, Mr Walker said they helped form an important link between the city and its history.\"These artefacts were part of a collection that documents the links between Britain and countries formerly part of the British Empire from the late 18th Century to the late 20th Century,\" said Mr Walker.  \"The collection is of cultural significance to many countries and provides an invaluable record and insight into the lives of those involved in and affected by the British Empire.\"Avon and Somerset PoliceThe men are described as being white and were all wearing jackets and baseball capsPolice are keen to speak to anyone who recognises the men captured on CCTV, or who may have seen possible stolen items being sold online.All of the men are thought to be white. The first was described as of medium to stocky build and was wearing a white cap, black jacket, light-coloured trousers and black trainers.The second was described as being of slim build and was wearing a grey, hooded jacket, black trousers and black trainers.Avon and Somerset PoliceThe items were taken from a building in the Cumberland basinThe third man was wearing a green cap, black jacket, light-coloured shorts and white trainers. Police said he appeared to walk with a slight limp in his right leg.The fourth was described as being of large build and was wearing a two-toned orange and navy or black puffy jacket, black trousers and black and white trainers.A city council spokesman said police decided to delay a public appeal about the thefts until it had undertaken thorough initial inquiries. He added it had also taken time for archive staff to audit thousands of items held within the stores to establish what was missing. Internet links",

    "body": "60 minutes agoAndré Rhoden-PaulMODThe Russian submarine was tracked by a Royal Navy tanker The Royal Navy says it has tracked a Russian submarine through the English Channel to \"safeguard\" UK waters. A tanker shadowed the Russian Kilo-class submarine Krasnodar as it sailed on the surface from the North Sea, through the Strait of Dover and into the English Channel, it said.The Royal Navy added that it had been prepared to \"pivot to anti-submarine operations\" if Krasnodar had dived below the surface. The incident is the latest in a series of instances of Russian naval activity in UK waters. The government says there has been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years - though Russia says the UK is the one being provocative.The Russian submarine and its tugboat Altay were tracked by Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) tanker Tidesurge carrying a specialist Merlin helicopter aboard, as part of a three-day operation.It said this was part of the government's commitment to \"safeguard the integrity of UK waters and protect national security\", the Royal Navy said. Capt James Allen, commanding officer of RFA Tidesurge, said the vessel had provided \"a show of presence and deterrence as we transited from the North Sea to the English Channel\".The navy continued to shadow the Russian submarine and its tugboat until it approached the north-west of France, at which point tracking of it was handed over to a Nato ally. This week, Defence Secretary John Healey announced the government's Atlantic Bastion programme, which aims to secure the UK's undersea cables and pipelines from Russian threats - though critics say the navy lacks sufficient resources to do the job properly.It was revealed a month after Healey said a Russian spy ship had pointed lasers at RAF pilots tracking its activity near UK waters.  The UK said the ship was being used for gathering intelligence and mapping undersea cables.\"We see you. We know what you are doing. And we are ready,\" Healey said in a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin.  The Russian embassy has previously said it was \"not interested in British underwater communications\" and urged the UK to \"hold off taking any destructive steps which might aggravate the crisis situation on the European continent\".Meanwhile in the House Commons, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has warned MPs about Russian-linked attempts to target them on WhatsApp and other apps. In a letter, seen by the Press Association, the Speaker said there were a rising number of phishing attempts - where  a hostile actor attempts to trick people into sharing sensitive information or accessing their accounts - on platforms like Signal and WhatsApp which are used by MPs and UK officials. A government spokesperson said: \"The National Cyber Security Centre is working with partners in government and UK Parliament in response to recent targeting against commercial messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesLabour's flagship law on workers' rights faces continuing deadlock after the House of Lords inflicted another defeat on the government.The setback comes just two weeks after ministers said they had reached a compromise between businesses and unions on the right to claim unfair dismissal. The government had argued the agreement would unblock the passage of the Employment Rights Bill and allow it to become law.But peers have now backed a Conservative proposal to force a review of a Labour plan to abolish a cap on compensation in unfair dismissal cases.The proposal to abolish the cap - which emerged from talks between unions and business groups two weeks ago - did not feature in Labour's manifesto, and is being added to the bill at an unusually late stage.The bill is now due to return to the Commons on Monday, as the parliamentary process known as \"ping-pong\" continues until the two Houses agree.Unions have accused peers of \"defying the will of the British public\" by holding up the bill, but Downing Street has insisted the government was still committed to passing it before Christmas. The bill - which applies to England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland where employment law is devolved - has been described by the government as the \"biggest upgrade to rights at work for a generation\".It includes measures such as giving workers the right to sick pay and parental leave from their first day in a job, banning \"exploitative\" zero-hour contracts and strengthening the right to request flexible working.However, some businesses have expressed concerns over the plans, warning they will increase costs for employers.Last month the government dropped a commitment to offer all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job, after business groups said this would discourage firms from hiring.Instead, ministers now plan to introduce this right after six months.Following talks between major industry bodies and unions, the government also committed to scrapping limits on compensation for financial loss in ordinary unfair dismissal cases.Currently, awards to former employees who successfully bring a claim are limited to either their annual salary or £118,223, whichever is lower.This would bring the process more into line with \"automatic\" unfair dismissal cases - where workers have been sacked for reasons such as discrimination and whistleblowing - where financial loss awards are uncapped.'Recipe for the rich'On Wednesday evening, peers voted by 244 votes to 220 for a Tory proposal which would require the government to review compensation limits before scrapping them.During the debate, Tory shadow business minister Lord Sharpe argued uncapped compensation would benefit higher-paid workers, adding: \"This policy is a recipe for the rich and a wrecking of justice for working people.\" While he welcomed changes on rights to unfair dismissal, the peer said the government's new proposals on compensation limits had been brought forward \"at the 11th hour\" without any consultation.Lord Sharpe insisted calling for a review was \"not obstruction\" but \"the bare minimum that a competent administration should undertake\".Independent crossbench peer and entrepreneur Lord Londesborough said his email inbox was \"awash with anger and indignation\" from businesses over the government \"sneaking in this clause on uncapped compensation\".\"It is anti-entrepreneurial, anti-enterprise and, I fear, a job destroyer,\" he added.'Undemocratic'Defending the move, Business Minister Baroness Lloyd said the current system incentivised claimants to allege discrimination, as this allowed uncapped compensation.\"These types of claims are more complex and take longer for the tribunal to handle,\" she said.\"Therefore, by our removing the compensation cap for ordinary unfair dismissal claims, this incentive will be lessened, making it easier for tribunals to reach a judgement more quickly and decreasing burdens on the system.\"She said the government had \"worked collaboratively with employers and trade unions to find a compromise\" and called on peers to allow the bill to progress so workers could benefit from the reforms without any further delay. However, the Federation of Small Businesses has expressed reservations about the plan, warning that unlimited settlements \"would be difficult and further gum up tribunals\".\"That was not a concession discussed with us or agreed by us in the negotiations,\" added executive director Craig Beaumont. TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"Continuing to vote down the Employment Rights Bill, a clear manifesto commitment, is undemocratic.\"This bill has been debated and scrutinised for months. Tory peers are actively defying the will of the British public and their own supporters who overwhelmingly support measures in this bill.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "'Police apology too little, too late,' says brother of first child killed in Troubles 2 hours agoPacemakerNine-year-old Patrick Rooney was hit in his bedroom by one of the shots fired by police in west Belfast to disperse rioters at Divis flats in August 1969An apology from police to the family of the first child killed in the Troubles in Northern Ireland has been described by his brother as \"bittersweet and too little, too late\".Nine-year-old Patrick Rooney, the oldest of six, was shot in front of the rest of his family while taking shelter in a bedroom in the Divis flats in August 1969.Outside, Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officers had opened fire from vehicle-mounted machine guns to to disperse rioters. The family will receive \"significant compensation,\" the High Court heard on Thursday.The settlement was announced in the legal action taken by the boy's 88-year-old mother against the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).She was not able to attend court due to ill health.Patrick's brother Con, who was eight at the time of the killing, said the apology and compensation brought some closure for the family, but \"we still feel we've been denied justice\".Patrick had taken shelter along with his five siblings and their parents in a bedroom at their home.Up to 200 high velocity rounds were discharged by police, striking a number of properties in the tower.Patrick was shot through the head.His parents were unable to secure medical assistance at the scene and his father and other members of the public had to carry him from the area to reach an ambulance.'Too afraid to go up the stairs'Con Rooney says he and his family saw red flashes from the gunfire before his brother Patrick was killedDescribing the events of the night his brother died, Mr Rooney said: \"We were all brought in to the back room to shelter and a couple of  minutes later we could just see all the red flashes and my father turned round and said to my mother 'Alice I've been shot'.\"It was actually a bullet had grazed him and my mummy got a graze across the cheek.\"He said his mother then looked over and thought Patrick had fainted.\"She went to lift him and she'd a coat on and whenever she looked at her arm it was covered in blood.\"Patrick was put on the bed and my mummy ran down the stairs screaming.\"Mr Rooney said an ambulance couldn't get to the house so his father and   neighbours carried Patrick to where they could get one, but he died in hospital around two hours later.He said after the funeral \"when we went back to the flat, we [he and his siblings] wouldn't go upstairs for months, we had to sleep in the living-room, on the floor, because we were too afraid to go up the stairs because we thought he was still up the stairs.\"On Thursday, the judge called on the authorities to fast-track the undisclosed settlement, and an apology was issued for the hurt and suffering and loss caused to the family.'Sincerely apologise'The family's lawyers said the RUC took steps to prevent an adequate or effective probe into the circumstances surrounding the shooting. A police ombudsman report in 2021 into the killing of Patrick and three others found that officers were never held to account due to investigative failings. The ombudsman also stated the use of vehicle-mounted machine guns by officers to deal with rioting in Belfast in 1969 was \"disproportionate and dangerous\".No former officers were prosecuted due to a lack of evidence.His mother Alice sued the PSNI chief constable over both the shooting and the failure to conduct an effective inquiry or discipline the officers responsible.Damages were sought for negligence, breach of statutory duty, assault and battery, conspiracy to commit an unlawful act, and misfeasance in public office.Under the terms of the resolution an apology was read out in open court. It stated: \"As a result of negotiations, the plaintiff Mrs Rooney, has agreed a satisfactory full and final settlement of this action with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\"The PSNI acknowledges the hurt and suffering caused to the family and wishes to sincerely apologise for the loss they endured.\" Formal authorisation for the undisclosed damages is still to be obtained from the Policing Board, along with the Department of Justice and Department of Finance at Stormont.'Violent and indiscriminate'\"The trauma this must have resulted in (for the family) is just unimaginable,\" Mr Justice Rooney said.The family's solicitor, Katie McAllister of Madden and Finucane, said it had taken 56 years for a chief constable to offer an apology for the unlawful death.\"This occurred in the most violent, indiscriminate and in fact avoidable circumstances,\" she stressed.\"Patrick was killed in his own bedroom, the very place that he should have been most safe from danger.\"",

    "body": "52 minutes agoLaura GozziReutersThe US has proposed Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region and create a \"special economic zone\" in the areas it currently controls, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.Zelensky said territory and control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remained the two main unresolved issues in the peace plan proposal for Ukraine.In a sobering briefing to reporters, Zelensky addressed the US desire for a quick end to the conflict, the complex nature of the ongoing negotiations, and his belief that Russia had no desire to stop the war.Ukraine has sent the US an updated 20-point plan plus separate documents on security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.It follows weeks of high-level diplomatic activity which has seen several peace plans drawn up, adjusted and revised by the US, Ukraine, Russia and European leaders.\"The final mile is the hardest. Everything could fall apart for many reasons,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. Russia demands that Ukraine relinquishes control of roughly 30% of the eastern Donetsk region it still holds - something Ukraine has refused to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions.According to Zelensky, the US is now envisaging a solution that would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, and Russian forces committing to not advancing into the territory. This area would become a \"special economic zone\" or a \"demilitarised zone\", Zelensky said.However, he noted that it would not be fair for the Ukrainians to withdraw unilaterally, and that Russia should also pull back by the same distance. \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" he asked.Zelensky said these were \"very serious concerns\" and that Ukraine might not accept the proposal at all – although he opened the door to elections or a referendum to give the Ukrainian people a choice.But he acknowledged that the fighting would continue and may yet shape the future of the negotiations: \"Much depends on our military – what they can hold, where they can stop the enemy, what they can destroy. This affects the entire configuration.\"The management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was another highly contentious point, Zelensky said.The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. Zelensky said a possible solution would be for the Russians to withdraw and Kyiv to share control of the plant with the Americans – although he acknowledged that the details of such an arrangement were still unclear, and it is doubtful that Moscow would agree.US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the conflict, and Kyiv and its allies fear the Americans might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.Zelensky told reporters that although the Americans wanted a \"quicker conclusion\" to the war, there were no deadlines for an agreement. Ukraine - which is targeted by widespread aerial attacks on a near-nightly basis - has been pushing for respite and would want an immediate ceasefire to be implemented ahead of a more laborious agreement being fleshed out.But Russia stands to gain more from a ceasefire being delayed, as its troops continue to make small but incremental gains on the frontline and its attacks exhaust the Ukrainian population.\"After multiple rounds of talks with Russia\" the Americans were now aligned on Moscow on this position, Zelensky said. Kremlin officials have been more tight-lipped than their European, US and Ukrainian counterparts. However, whenever possible, Russia has sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said a recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" between the two sides.The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine.\"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.But neither Ukraine nor Europe will be likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value, given Russia has previously violated ceasefires and truce deals.European and Ukrainian officials want the US to be involved in giving security guarantees so that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.Zelensky said he had received a draft proposal on American security guarantees but that the draft was a work in progress, suggesting that what has been offered by the US falls short of provisions that could assuage Kyiv's fears.\"The US does not want Ukraine in Nato. They say this openly... So I do not think they have difficulties discussing Nato with the Russians,\" Zelensky said.Zelensky also said Ukraine had to be \"cautious\", adding: \"We do not know what other agreements the US may have with Russia. We will learn in time.\" Ukraine's president also acknowledged that US support for Kyiv may one day end, both in terms of the flow of weapons that the US is selling through other countries and in terms of intelligence sharing. Reflecting the fraught nature of the talks and his scepticism that Russia was negotiating in good faith, Zelensky told reporters: \"No one knows what may happen the day after tomorrow... We do not know how these negotiations will end.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoJim Reed,Health reporterandWesley Stephenson,BBC VerifyPA MediaThe NHS has urged those eligible to get vaccinated against flu to help limit the severity of symptomsThe NHS says it's facing its \"worst-case scenario\" after the number of people in hospital with flu jumped by 55% in a week.NHS England chief executive Sir Jim Mackey has warned that between 5,000 and 8,000 hospital beds could be filled with flu patients by the weekend.Health experts at the King's Fund think tank have said talk of an \"unrelenting flu wave\" has become worrying familiar over recent years. How then is winter 2025 really any different and which patients have been affected most by what the NHS is now describing as \"super flu\"? An earlier start for fluThe major difference between 2025's flu season and the previous three years is that the virus started spreading around a month earlier. The first sign of this was in October in data published by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). When someone goes to their GP or hospital with flu-like symptoms they can be tested for a number of viruses including influenza, Covid and RSV. UKHSA records the percentage of those tests that come back positive for flu, which can then give a strong indication that rates in the community are either rising or falling.Virologists have linked the earlier flu season this year to a subtle shift in the genetic makeup of the main flu virus that is circulating - called H3N2.So-called 'super-flu' is not a medical term and it does not mean the virus is more severe or harder to treat. But the general public has not encountered this exact version of flu before, which means there may be less immunity built up in society, allowing it to spread more easily.Children and young people most affectedChildren tend to be more susceptible to flu than older adults, partly because their immune systems are still developing and because they tend to spread viruses more quickly through close contact. The latest breakdown of UKHSA data shows that the proportion of positive tests is currently much higher in children and young people still at school or university. Some schools have had to bring back Covid-like measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as cutting back on singing in assemblies and introducing sanitisation stations, while one site in Caerphilly had to close temporarily.Each year thousands of otherwise healthy children end up in A&E with complications after catching influenza. But there is another concern: that younger people will go home and then spread the disease to elderly relatives who tend to be more vulnerable.Flu adds to winter pressureThe NHS records the number of patients in hospital each week with influenza and other types of respiratory illness. The number has been rising sharply in England with an average of 2,660 flu patients taking up a hospital bed last week, up from 1,717 in the previous week.Those over 85-years-old are five times more likely to be hospitalised than the general population.  But the patients being admitted now would have been infected with the virus a week or so ago when infection rates were lower. The greater concern for the health service is what happens over the coming weeks as new cases appear in A&E.The NHS has roughly 105,000 available hospital beds in England and tends to \"run hot\" over the winter with 95% of those taken up at any one time. If the number of flu patients needing overnight treatment jumps to 5,000 or higher, as Sir Jim Mackey predicts, then it could put the whole hospital system under more pressure. What about vaccine protection?The message coming from doctors and the NHS is for people in vulnerable groups to continue to come forward for a flu vaccine.Even though the genetic make-up of the virus has shifted this winter, the main jab is still thought to offer effective protection, particularly against severe disease.The flu vaccine is free on the NHS for those over 65-years-old, young children, pregnant women, those with certain health conditions, carers, and front line health and social care workers.People in other groups can get the same vaccine for between £15 and £25 from high street pharmacists.As of 30 November, around 70% of older people and care home residents had taken up the offer of a free flu jab.But vaccination rates in younger at-risk groups such as the clinically vulnerable were lower at just over 40%. Rates among NHS workers in England, which have fallen back since the Covid pandemic, appear to have stabilised this year at roughly the same level - around 42%.",

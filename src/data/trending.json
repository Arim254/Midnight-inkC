Whether this means custody or not will be decided when all the information is before the court.\" The court heard Coote extracted the video from a hard drive to a laptop on 2 January 2020.Getty ImagesCoote officiated his first match in the Premier League in 2018He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge at a hearing on 10 September at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.At the six-minute hearing on Tuesday, Coote, who wore a navy suit and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and enter his guilty plea.The charge of making an indecent image of a child refers to activities such as downloading, sharing or saving photos or videos containing abuse.Judge Shant KC said: \"You must not go away with the impression that this will not lead to a custodial sentence.\"Coote was sacked last year when comments made in a video about former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in 2020 came to light.In August this year, he was given an eight-week suspension by the Football Association over the Klopp footage.In January, Coote came out as gay in an interview with The Sun and said a lifelong struggle to hide his sexuality had contributed to the rant about Klopp.Additional reporting by PA Media",

    "body": "Three police officers have been killed and at least 15 other people injured in an apparently deliberate gas explosion at a farmhouse in northern Italy.The blast was triggered as police and firefighters went into the house near Verona to carry out an eviction order for two brothers and a sister in their late 50s and mid-60s. The three victims who died were members of the Carabinieri military police. A man and a woman were arrested at the scene and another man who fled after the explosion was located soon after. All three have been taken to hospital. The blast could be heard some 5km (3 miles) away and images from the scene showed the building reduced to a pile of rubble. The head of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, said the farmhouse was subject to an eviction order due to debts accrued by the three owners.\"This is a time for grieving,\" said Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, who added that attempts had been made to evict the three siblings in the past. \"It was clear we were dealing with people who would resist in some way,\" he said. Mediators had been sent to speak to the siblings who had barricaded themselves into the house. When the Carabinieri arrived shortly after 03:00 (01:00 GMT), officials believe one of the siblings triggered the blast.\"Upon entering the house, we were confronted with an act of absolute madness,\" provincial police commander Claudio Papagno told the Ansa news agency.\"A gas cylinder had been ignited, and the explosion directly hit our officers,\" he said.Petrol bombs were also found at the property, the interior minister said.Those injured by the blast included 11 other members of the Carabinieri and well as three members of Italy's state police and a firefighter, Ansa reported.According to the Verona prosecutor, Raffaele Tito, the farmhouse was in a derelict state and had no electricity. The prosecutor believed the blast had taken place on a floor above the entrance and told reporters it was a \"premeditated and voluntary homicide\". Shortly before the explosion, he said officers had \"heard a whistle, probably the gas cylinders being opened\".\"We all knew the situation was dire,\" neighbours told Italian media, adding that the three had previously threatened to \"blow themselves up\" rather than leave the house.Piantedosi said the explosion had left a \"terrible, very painful and dramatic toll\".Defence Minister Guido Crosetto joined other political leaders in paying tribute to the three men who had lost their lives in the service of their country.",

Mr Dodsworth appeared via video link from HMP Wakefield. He spoke only to confirm his name.The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Guy Kearl KC, set a provisional trial date of 5 May 2026 during the short hearing.Judge Kearl said the \"issues in the case\" had yet to be established.Prosecutor Tom Storey KC told the court Mr Gedel had refused to attend the hearing via video link because \"it appears he wanted to attend in person\".A member of Mr Gedel's family was present in court.No details about the incident which led to Watkins' death were revealed, but the court was told the defendants were charged with murder on Monday morning.A plea and trial preparation hearing will take place at Leeds Crown Court on 12 November.The trial is expected to last between two and three weeks.Derbyshire Police/Metropolitan PoliceSamuel Dodsworth and Rico Gedel are serving prison sentences at HMP WakefieldWatkins, who also faced a further six years on licence if he was ever released, admitted the attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13 but pleaded not guilty to rape.He also admitted conspiring to rape a child, three counts of sexual assault involving children, seven involving taking, making or possessing indecent images of children and one of possessing an extreme pornographic image involving a sex act on an animal.During sentencing, Mr Justice Royce said the case broke \"new ground\" and \"plunged into new depths of depravity\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Personal data may have been stolen in the ransomware attack that forced Asahi to halt beer production, the company has said. Japan's biggest brewer was forced to pause operations at most of its 30 factories in the country after a cyber-attack late last month disrupted everything from beer shipments to its accounting system.All of Asahi's facilities have now partially reopened and restarted production but computer systems remain down, meaning orders are being processed using pen, paper and fax machines. In a statement on Tuesday, Asahi said it was investigating whether personal information was stolen in the attack. The company said its Emergency Response Headquarters were working with cybersecurity experts to \"restore the system as quickly as possible\", and will contact those affected by the hack.\"As we continue investigating the extent and details of the impact, focusing on the systems targeted in the recent attack, we have identified the possibility that personal information may have been subject to unauthorised data transfer,\" it said.  \"Should the investigation confirm this, we will promptly notify those concerned and take appropriate measures in accordance with applicable laws on the protection of personal information.\"It remains unclear what personal information was stolen, and Asahi declined to provide more detail as the matter is currently under investigation. Asahi Group also owns Fullers in the UK and global brands including Peroni, Grolsch, and Pilsner Urquell. But Asahi said only its systems and operations in Japan - which account for around half of its sales - have been affected by the attack. Asahi apologised for \"any difficulties\" caused by the incident.The company also said it would delay the disclosure of its third-quarter financial results, citing the disruption caused by the attack.  The disclosure would be more than 45 days after the end of the October to December quarter, Asahi said, but when exactly would depend on the progress of restoring its system. Russia-based ransomware group Qilin claimed responsibility for the attack, which has previously hacked other big organisations, including the NHS. The cyber-attack is the latest to have hit operations at major firms. Jaguar Land Rover, Marks and Spencer, and Co-op are among the major British companies that have been affected this year.The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has reported a record rise in \"nationally significant\" cyber-attacks in the last year, with an average of four happening every week. They urged businesses to take \"concrete action\" to protect themselves from attacks. ",

    "body": "Venezuela announced on Monday it would close its embassy in Oslo, days after opposition leader María Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.In a statement, the Venezuelan government did not comment on Machado's prize, saying that the closure was part of a restructuring of its foreign service.Norway's foreign ministry confirmed that Caracas had closed its embassy in Oslo without providing a reason.The Nobel Committee in Oslo awarded her the prize on Friday in recognition of what it called \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela\", while Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro referred to the 58-year-old laureate as a \"demonic witch\".The Norwegian foreign ministry called the decision \"regrettable\". \"Despite our differences on several issues, Norway wishes to keep the dialogue open with Venezuela and will continue to work in this direction,\" a ministry spokeswoman said.She added that the Nobel Prize \"is independent of the Norwegian government\".Machado has for years been campaigning against Maduro, whose 12-year rule is viewed by many nations as illegitimate.She has been forced to live in hiding for much of the past year.María Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace PrizeIn honouring her achievement, Nobel chairman Jørgen Watne Frydnes called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided... in a brutal authoritarian state that is now suffering a humanitarian and economic crisis.\"Machado told BBC Mundo her award was \"like an injection\" for her political movement. \"It infuses energy, hope, strength on the Venezuelan people because we realise that we are not alone,\" she said.Caracas also closed its embassy in Australia while opening new outposts in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, which it called \"strategic partners in the fight\" against \"hegemonic pressures\".Venezuela's closure of embassies in two close US allies comes after weeks of heightened tension between Caracas and Washington.The US military has destroyed at least four boats that it said were carrying narcotics from Venezuela to the US, killing at least 21 people on board, in what the Trump administration calls a war on drugs. The strikes have attracted condemnation in countries including Venezuela and Colombia, with some international lawyers describing the strikes as a breach of international law.The last time Norway suffered a diplomatic blow over the Nobel Peace Prize was with China in 2010, when it was awarded to political dissident Liu Xiaobo. Beijing suspended trade and other relations, and only normalised ties with Oslo six years later. ",

A consultant who treated her questioned whether she had been assaulted.An inquest jury at South London Coroners' court concluded that her death was accidental, but her family says they still have questions about what led to her death.Large bruise on her backThe inquest heard that Maria Morris, who worked as a teaching assistant, had bi-polar affective disorder.In September 2021, her family and friends became concerned when she started acting erratically and found that she had stopped taking her medication.Police were called after she ran away from a friend while walking in a park. When found, she was delusional and taken to Croydon Hospital.She was transferred to Bethlem Royal Hospital, a mental health hospital run by South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM), on 18 September where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.The jury was told that while Maria was on the unit, she raised a number of concerns about how staff were treating patients. She told one member of staff that patients were being \"punished\" at night.On the evening of the 21 September, Maria was observed by staff in her room at 20:00 and then again at 20:30. At 21:23, a member of staff found her unconscious on the floor of her room, having had a cardiac arrest.During attempts to resuscitate her, a sock was found in her throat. When paramedics arrived, three further socks were removed from her throat.By the time she was transferred to Croydon University Hospital, she had suffered a hypoxic brain injury. A few hours later she went into cardiac arrest again and died on 22 September.The jury was told that Dr Simon Wood, an intensive care doctor at Croydon Hospital who treated Maria, alerted the police to a large bruise on her back.He also said that, in his view, a patient wouldn't have been able to push socks down their own throat without gagging. He was concerned that this may have indicated she'd been assaulted.The jury heard that there was no CCTV used on the wards at Bethlem Hospital and there was nothing in Maria's notes or observations to explain the bruising.Maria's room was locked when she was found. The court heard that most patients had keys for their own rooms, but there was no record on who had what key.Staff had master keys that could unlock all the patients' rooms.Untested bloodIn a statement read to the court, Metropolitan police officer DC Herdeep Jugdev said that his investigation had been hindered because Maria's room in Bethlem had been cleared, and the sock disposed of, before they got there 19 hours after her death was reported.During their investigation, the police spotted what appeared to be blood under Maria's nails, although this did not appear to have been tested to see whose it was.John Taylor, the South London Coroner, told the jury that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Maria was assaulted on the ward, or that someone else had pushed socks into her airway.The inquest heard conflicting evidence from staff at Bethlem about how often Maria was checked on the night she died.Some documents and witnesses suggested she should have been checked four or five times an hour. Others suggested she should have been checked once an hour.The jury concluded that Maria had pushed the socks down her own throat, but that her death had been accidental. They were unable to reach a conclusion on whether a lack of observations contributed to her death, because of the conflicting evidence.'Immense pain'In a statement, Maria's family said she was a much-loved mother, daughter and sister, and that her death \"has left a profound and lasting void in the hearts of her family and all who loved her\".\"We are grateful to the jury for having identified that there were missed opportunities around communication, documentation and observations. \"As a family, the idea that more could have been done to keep her safe causes us immense pain.\"The family also said it felt the jury was not allowed to comment on all the issues it considered to be important.\"As a family we still have questions about exactly what happened that night.\"South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM) says it will be rolling out CCTV in all its wards and opening a new CCTV control centre in November.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoLewis AdamsEssexPA MediaFayaz Khan made the threat in a video he uploaded to TikTokA man who came to the UK on a small boat and threatened to kill Nigel Farage has been jailed for five years.Fayaz Khan, 26, made a gun gesture with his hand, pointed to an AK-47 tattoo on his face and named the Reform UK leader in a TikTok post in October 2024.Authorities believed the Afghan migrant had given them a false name and he was actually a 31-year-old called Fayaz Husseini, Southwark Crown Court heard.Speaking outside court, Farage said it was a \"win\" that \"violent criminal\" Khan had been jailed.The defendant was found guilty on Friday of making threats to kill the MP for Clacton, in Essex. In the video on his \"madapasa\" account on TikTok, Khan pointed towards his face tattoo and said he was going to \"pop, pop, pop\" Farage, referring to him as \"Englishman Nigel\".PA MediaFarage told the gathered media outside court that Khan was a \"violent criminal\"Farage described the threat as \"pretty chilling\" during the trial, adding: \"Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried.\"\"The only reason we know about this guy is because somebody sent it to me on TikTok,\" he added after the sentencing.\"It makes me wonder how many other madapasas are there now in this country?\"It followed Khan shouting from the dock that he wanted to go back to Afghanistan, accusing Farage of using him \"because you want to be prime minister\".Khan was one of 65 migrants on board a black inflatable boat that entered the UK by crossing the English Channel.\"The defendant livestreamed the recording of his crossing, which appears to have gathered a large online viewing,\" said prosecutor Peter Ratliff.'Enemies' The court heard Khan gave a false name because he had \"enemies he did not want to find him\".However, the prosecution said it was \"more likely\" he had given misleading details due to his criminal record while living in Sweden.Mr Ratliff also disputed Khan's claim that he was unaware it was illegal to arrive in the UK by small boat.He claimed Khan \"intended to encourage others\" by documenting his journey from Sweden to the UK, sharing it with hundreds of thousands of viewers online.Metropolitan PoliceKhan spent nine years living in Sweden before he came to the UK in October 2024The court was told Khan had 17 previous convictions in Sweden, including for carrying a knife, threatening behaviour and vandalism.Khan was also jailed in June 2019 after using threatening behaviour towards a public servant.On 12 October 2024, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube entitled \"the journey of an illegal migrant\", which showed Khan and referenced \"young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little\".'Gun gestures'Jurors in Khan's trial were told he responded with a TikTok video two days later, threatening Farage.In the video, he said: \"You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me.\"Don't talk about me more. Delete the video.\"I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop.\"Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said \"pop, pop, pop\", he made \"gun gestures\" with his hand and headbutted the camera.During sentencing, Khan's barrister said the defendant wanted to apologise to Farage and his sister \"for any offence and upset caused\".He was also sentenced to eight months - to run concurrently - for entering the UK illegally, having previously pleaded guilty to the offence.Nicholas Coates, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Khan not only entered the UK illegally – but made sinister threats against a Member of Parliament in plain view of thousands of followers.\"Elected politicians must be able to carry out their jobs free from the fear of harm or abuse, and we will make sure that those who seek to intimidate them face the full force of the law.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWage growth in the UK cooled slightly over the summer, as unemployment ticked up marginally.Average wage growth was 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% over the three months to July, according to new data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The national unemployment rate rose slightly from 4.7% to 4.8%.Analysts said the data indicated that the UK jobs market was stabilising after a year of volatility.Job vancancies fell by 9,000, or 1.3%, in the three months to September, and the ONS said this was the 39th consecutive period in which job openings had fallen compared to the previous three months.Liz McKeown, the ONS's director of economic statistics, said: \"After a long period of weak hiring activity, there are signs that the falls we have seen in both payroll numbers and vacancies are now levelling off.\"Youth drive unemploymentMs McKeown said the ONS was seeing different patterns among age groups, adding \"the increase in unemployment was driven mostly by younger people.\"There was a quarterly drop in the number of people who were economically inactive because they were students or retired, but this was largely offset by a rise in economic inactivity for other reasons, including long-term illness and for other reasons.Danni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis, said the figures were creating \"a clearer picture of a labour market that's soft, with younger workers facing the biggest challenges\".She said the decision by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to raise employer national insurance \"made it more expensive for employers who had lots of part-time staff, many of them being younger workers dipping their toe in the labour market for the first time\".\"The fact the ONS has found that the rise in unemployment in the three months to August was driven mostly by younger people suggests those warnings have become reality,\" Ms Hewson said.\"Making it harder to find these types of jobs could have a marked impact on their relationship with work in the future.\"The ONS has said the unemployment rate should be treated with caution and it is taking additional steps to address concerns about the quality of the data.'Steady labour market'Annual wage growth was 6% for the public sector and 4.4% for the private sector.Private sector earnings growth was the lowest in four years but was still ahead of inflation.The ONS said the public sector annual growth rate is affected by some public sector pay rises being paid earlier in 2025 than in 2024.Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Finding a job is more of an uphill task with each passing month. For those in work, meanwhile, wages are now rising only a fraction ahead of inflation.\"Employers have cited rising national insurance as the reason they are cutting back on new hires, but Ms Coles said it was hard to tell how much of an impact that was having on the jobs market.\"It's not all doom and gloom. At this level, unemployment remains low by historic standards, and the employment rate has actually risen slightly over the past year.\"But Chris Hare, the senior UK economist at HSBC, told BBC Radio's Today programme the data indicates \"a fairly steady labour market\".\"I think we're probably seeing fairly soft demand for labour in the economy,\" he said, adding that it should lead to \"a gradual easing in broader cost pressures in the labour market and an easing in wage growth\".The number of people who were made redundant between June and August increased from the same period last year, to 3.8 per 1,000 employees in June to August 2025.The ONS also revised the previous figure for wage growth, bringing it up from 4.7% to 4.8%.This figure will likely be used to calculate the increase to the state pension for next year.Under the triple lock policy, the state pension is increased by the highest of wage growth, inflation or 2.5%.'Paltry' real wage growthInflation currently stands at 3.8%, meaning that real wage growth - how much better off workers are when accounting for rises in the cost of living - was 0.9%.Responding to the figures, the Liberal Democrats said that real wage growth is barely keeping up with inflation.Similarly, the Resolution Foundation said real wage growth was \"paltry\", and that real weekly wages have only increased by £1.50 since last September — \"barely enough to cover the cost of a Greggs sausage roll\".Charlie McCurdy, an economist at the think tank, said: \"The deteriorating labour market, coupled with persistently high inflation, means that cost of living pressures are likely to build over the autumn.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoJames FitzGerald andBrandon DrenonUS President Donald Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey have signed a declaration for bringing peace to Gaza at a summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el- Sheikh.\"A new and beautiful day is rising and now the rebuilding begins,\" said Trump, praising regional leaders who helped cement the truce between Israel and Hamas.Earlier, in his address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, the president told cheering lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\". Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza in exchange for the last 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas.The exchange, the first phase of Trump's peace plan, is also due to include the return of the bodies of 28 dead Israeli hostages.In Egypt, Trump was all smiles in the company of Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi and more than 20 other leaders from around the world.\"Everybody's happy,\" Trump said, adding that he had done \"big deals before\" but \"this has taken off like a rocket ship\". \"This took 3,000 years to get to this point, can you believe it? And it's going to hold up too,\" he said. After the ceremony, President al-Sisi awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, a necklace made of pure gold considered to be Egypt's highest honour.The Egyptian president called the day a \"historic milestone that ends an agonising chapter\".Among the many world leaders at the summit who stood for a photo opportunity with Trump was Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who less than a week ago was blocked by the US from attending the UN General Assembly in New York.Although the first phase of the ceasefire agreement has been enacted, there is a lingering question over what role the Palestinian Authority might eventually play in Gaza.Trump said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump told the Israeli parliament.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.Introducing Trump to parliament, Netanyahu called the US president the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, he said.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.Some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Trump's speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.The ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.",

    "body": "Palestinians celebrate return of detainees freed by Israel23 hours agoTom BennettRamallah, occupied West BankWatch: Palestinian prisoners released in West Bank to rapturous crowdsHundreds of freed Palestinian prisoners and detainees have been welcomed with tears and screams of joy as they were released by Israel to be reunited with their families in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.The release involved about 250 prisoners who had been convicted of crimes including murder and deadly attacks against Israelis - and about 1,700 detainees from Gaza who had been held by Israel without charge. As prisoners exited a Red Cross bus in Ramallah, many draped in traditional Keffiyeh scarves, they looked pale and gaunt, with some struggling to walk.They were freed as part of an exchange in which 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of four deceased hostages were released by Hamas. \"He is ready to embrace freedom,\" said Amro Abdullah, 24, who was waiting for his cousin Rashid Omar, 48, who was arrested in July 2005 and sentenced to life in prison by an Israeli court after being found guilty of murder and other crimes.\"I want peace,\" Mr Abudullah said. \"I want to live a happy life, safe and peaceful, without occupation and without restrictions.\"It is thought about 100 prisoners were released into the West Bank, with many others set to be deported and a small number freed into East Jerusalem.Follow live coverage hereReutersIsrael made clear before the release process that it wanted to avoid the jubilant scenes that surrounded prisoners arriving in Ramallah during previous hostage deals, when large crowds waved Hamas flags.Many families were reluctant to speak to the media, saying they had been warned against doing so by the Israeli military.In Gaza, families gathered at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the hope of being reunited with their loved ones. A field hospital adjacent to the main hospital building was set up to receive them.\"This is a very beautiful feeling - happy, a day of joy,\" said Muhammad Hasan Saeed Dawood, 50, who told the BBC he was there to collect his son who he says was arrested by Israeli forces at a checkpoint.\"We call it a national holiday, that our detainees are being released despite the cost of the war, the martyrs, the injured, and the destruction in Gaza.\"Khalil Muhammad Abdulrahman Al-Qatrous was also there to collect his son who he said had been detained for about three months.\"There is joy, and there is pain, and there is happiness, and there is sorrow,\" he said. \"We came here waiting for their release. We came here expecting them to arrive at 10:00, and now it is past 12:00, and we are still waiting, on edge.\"AFP via Getty ImagesBuses of freed Palestinian detainees arrived in Khan Younis, southern Gaza to cheers from gathered crowdsAhead of the release in Ramallah, ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society set up in preparation to treat any injured prisoners.\"The crying and the silence, this shows you how the families are feeling,\" said Ibrahim Ifani, 23, a volunteer nurse for the organisation.\"For all the people in Palestine, it's a deep, deep emotion,\" he said.Multiple medics and family members said the prisoners who were released in Ramallah had faced beatings in recent days prior to their release.The BBC cannot verify claims of mistreatment in Israeli prisons. But Israel's top court said last month that Palestinian prisoners were not being given adequate food.The BBC has also previously reported on Palestinians being tortured in Israeli detention.Aya Shreiteh, 26, from the Palestinian Prisoners Club said \"their rights were violated in the most serious ways\". \"Most of the prisoners in the past year were subjected to deliberate starvation and exposure to illness,\" she told the BBC.\"Their bodies are frail from starvation, and they've suffered from beatings.\"\"But today gives us hope that there will always be an inevitable freedom, no matter the circumstances,\" she added. The hostage and prisoner exchange formed part of phase one of Donald Trump's peace plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.Israel launched a retaliatory military offensive which saw more than 67,682 Palestinians killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. A ceasefire took hold on Friday - and negotiations are now expected to follow over the latter phases of Trump's peace plan. More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsTina JefferyTina was in a coma for six weeks after falling down a flight of stairsAs Tina walks onto the stage in front of hundreds of people she is beaming. She's collecting her British Sign Language (BSL) certificate which is the culmination of a journey that began with tragedy.\"Learning BSL has helped me say words that I cannot speak,\" she says.In 2018, while returning from a holiday, Tina fell down a flight of stairs and was in a coma for six weeks. The accident caused a traumatic brain injury that dramatically changed her life, leaving her struggling to speak. Before the fall, Tina had been a high achiever - she and her husband Mark met while working as navigators in the RAF, and Tina went on to retrain as a lawyer. Now 59, Tina says learning sign language has given her a new way to communicate. \"I'm scared of talking sometimes but BSL has helped me relax as sometimes I remember the sign if I can't remember a word.\"Three years ago, Tina and Mark moved to Hughenden Gardens Retirement Village in High Wycombe to access more support. \"When I arrived here I only spoke a bit and I was very silent as I wasn't very confident,\" explains Tina.But as a result of moving to the village, they became participants in the BBC series Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands, New Tricks, filmed in March, which set out to explore how British Sign Language could transform the lives of older residents. Rogan ProductionsParticipants of Rose's documentary say the process of learning BSL was rewarding despite being challenging at times The series sees Rose, who has been deaf since birth, teach BSL to a group of older residents, showing how it uses visual sign language using gestures, facial expressions and body language to communicate.\"People think sign language is just for deaf people but it's so much more than that, especially for people who are losing their hearing,\" Ayling-Ellis explains. \"BSL has helped Tina communicate as you use your face and expressions as well as hands so you can understand emotions better,\" Mark, 64, says. She is one of five residents to achieve a Level 1 BSL qualification, alongside several staff members.\"I'm so proud of them,\" Ayling-Ellis says. \"I didn't think they could get further than the alphabet but they proved me wrong and should be proud of themselves.\" Tina has continued to learn BSL after the documentary through classes taught by her husband. Despite never intending to teach, after taking part in the TV series, Mark now leads regular practice sessions with 20 people. \"We raised some money to get a proper instructor to give us lessons but alongside the formal lessons I run a group every week for a few hours where I put people through their paces,\" Mark says. The pair have benefited immensely from learning BSL, but \"it was surprisingly tiring\". \"I'm fit and heathy and was still finding it tough going - we were knackered from it,\" Mark says.There were classes three times a week and then homework and revision in the evening. The group started by learning the alphabet and numbers which came in handy when the residents hosted a signed bingo evening.The lessons also proved useful in unexpected ways.\"At medical appointments we realised we could sign to each other to communicate something privately,\" explains Mark.Rogan ProductionsTina is one of five participants from the show who have passed their BSL Level 1 Since the documentary aired, the couple have helped turn Hughenden Gardens into a hub of deaf awareness. \"We are running deaf classes, building links with local deaf community and investigating new technologies to help people with hearing problems,\" Mark says. A monthly Deaf Café has been launched and a Jewish Deaf Association group of 29 people is due to visit the village later this month. It's also bought residents closer together and fostered a sense of community as \"there's nothing like adversity to help a team gel,\" according to Mark. Rogan ProductionsThe impact is being felt far beyond Hughenden.Mark says: \"Since March we've had many interesting visitors - one from Canada and there's a deaf club in another retirement village where there are 20 people all learning BSL.The retirement village is now focusing on how to be more deaf inclusive. Plans include deaf awareness training for all staff, new deaf-friendly entry intercoms, improved signage and the rollout of SignLive, a deaf-led video interpreting app.While Mark continues to transform the retirement village, Tina is pleased that BSL has helped her regain confidence and improve her communication. And the ripple effect continues. \"Our family all watched the documentary,\" says Mark. \"And people come up to us in the streets to say we've inspired people to take it up.\"",

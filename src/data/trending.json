    "body": "2 hours agoMadeline GerberGetty ImagesA young turtle from a Canadian children's book series is caught in an international feud after the US Defence Department used the character in a cartoon about killing alleged drug traffickers.The publisher of \"Franklin the Turtle\" books is criticising Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth for a social media post depicting the beloved children's character shooting the alleged criminals.\"We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image\", publisher Kids Can Press said. The publisher is not alone. Sabrina Carpenter lashed out at the White House on Tuesday for using her song in a video about deporting migrants, saying it was \"evil and disgusting\".\"Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,\" the singer posted.In Franklin's case, the cartoon posted by Hegseth on social media is a mock book cover depicting Franklin in a military helicopter firing a large weapon at alleged drug boats. The faux title reads: \"Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists.\"Toronto Star via Getty ImagesThe image comes amid a string of US strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats since early September. The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by attacking boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.Hegseth captioned the post: \"For your Christmas wish list...\"Franklin, the 6-year-old cartoon turtle, is known for navigating everyday challenges, from learning to ride a bike to having his first sleepover.He originated as the titular character in the Canadian children's book \"Franklin the Turtle\" and has grown to star in a number of television shows, films, video games and live productions.\"Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,\" publisher Kids Can Press said in its statement, adding that such a violent depiction \"directly contradicts these values\".Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement on Monday night that \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels... or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists\".The artists credited with creating Franklin and authoring his books did not respond to requests from the BBC for comment.In September, Pokémon said it did not give permission for the use of its theme song and other footage to be used in an ICE deportation raid video posted by the US government.British singer Jess Glynne also criticised White House officials in July after they used a viral Jet2holiday advert featuring her song in a video promoting deportations.",

    "body": "Trans girls can no longer join Girlguiding, organisation says1 hour agoJames MelleyAlamyGirlguiding is responsible for youth girl groups including Brownies and GuidesThe organisation that oversees girl guide groups in the UK has announced it is banning trans girls from joining.Girlguiding said the move – which means it will not accept biological boys who identify as girls - was in response to the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that said sex meant biological sex in equality law.The trustees said they had made the \"difficult decision\" with a \"heavy heart\" and there would be further announcements on what this will mean for current members.Trans rights organisation TransActual said: \"There is no problem being solved here, only harm being done.\" Women's rights charity Sex Matters said Girlguiding had done the \"right thing\" in making the change. Around 385,000 girls and young women between the ages of four and 18 take part in Rainbows, Brownies, Guides and Rangers groups around the UK.Girlguiding said: \"From today (2 December) trans girls and young women, and others not recorded female at birth, will no longer be able to join Girlguiding as new young members.\"Girlguiding said there would be no immediate changes for young members, but more information would be shared next week. It is not clear how many people the rule change will directly affect, as the organisation says it does not collect data on gender identity.\"This is a decision we would have preferred not to make, and we know that this may be upsetting for members of our community,\" the trustees said. \"Girlguiding believes strongly in inclusion, and we will continue to support young people and adults in marginalised groups.\"In UK law, the 2010 Equality Act sets out the rules for single sex organisations and spaces being able to exclude members of the opposite sex.In April, the Supreme Court ruled that this meant biological sex, meaning, for example, that a trans man could be excluded from a service set up for men.Draft guidelines on how to interpret the law by the equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), were presented to the government for consideration in September. A leaked copy was reported on last week, but it has not been officially published.Girlguiding said it has made its decision following consultation with members and legal advice. It will now allow only biologically female members to join.It said: \"Girlguiding's governing charity documents set out that the membership and people who benefit from our organisation are girls and women.\"The organisation was reportedly facing legal action from a parent who felt it was failing to follow the law.Biological girls who identify as boys are still able to join. The organisation also said most adult roles were already open to all and it was \"confident that no volunteers will have to leave\". Other adult roles are already designated specifically as female roles.Reacting to the decision, Sex Matter's CEO Maya Forstater said Girlguiding had done the \"right and only thing for it to do\".\"Both girls and boys deserve to have opportunities for adventure and learning, and Girlguiding provides an organisation that is just for girls.\"Tammy Hymas, from trans rights campaigners TransActual, said: \"It's awful that an organisation, which would happily be inclusive and has been for many years, is being forced to exclude young trans girls\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterThe popular YouTuber Marques Brownlee has announced he plans to shut down his subscription app for mobile phone wallpapers, Panels.The content creator, whose sometimes scathing takes on new tech products have helped him amass more than 20 million YouTube subscribers, launched the app in September 2024.Panels let people download a range of digital wallpapers for their devices for a monthly fee - starting at $11.99 (£9) a month.But more than a year after facing scrutiny over its price and privacy, Brownlee has told followers the app would be shut down altogether on 31 December. \"We made mistakes in making our first app and ultimately we weren't able to turn it into the vision that I had had,\" he said in a video on Sunday.Brownlee - who goes by MKBHD on his socials - told viewers he wanted it \"to become a vibrant ecosystem\" for wallpapers, and supporting the artists who design them.He said the app had had some successes - topping app download charts at launch and seeing two million wallpaper downloads - calling it \"a rollercoaster ride\". \"But at the end of the day, it wasn't able to sustain,\" he said, noting the app's \"niche\" appeal and audience.Brownlee had previously highlighted the app's potentially limited appeal when responding to criticism of it shortly after it launched.\"The target market for this is insanely small,\" he told one user on X last September who questioned his decision to launch a digital wallpapers app.\"Most people don't download a wallpaper app. \"This is for those who have been asking. If you're not into it, don't worry about it.\"He also thanked the artists who had been involved in creating wallpapers for the app.A notice on the Panels website said users would be able to keep purchased or downloaded wallpapers from the app \"forever\" and be refunded for any active subscriptions after its closure at the end of the month. They would also be able to create their own spin-offs of the app, as the code behind it would become open source.\"This will allow anyone to build on what we started - we're excited to see what new projects may grow from it,\" the notice read.",

    "body": "40 minutes agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterWork is under way to fix 6,000 Army support vehicles withdrawn from service over safety concerns, a defence minister has told MPs.Luke Pollard said the suspension of the British Army's entire support lorry fleet for repairs to be carried out, as first reported by The Times, was an example of the \"system working properly\".\"An issue was identified, a rectification was instructed and that is taking place,\" he told the Commons defence committee.He assured MPs that \"we have maintained forces at a degree of readiness,\" after Labour's Derek Twigg raised concerns about what would happen if the truck fleet was needed in an emergency. Known as the \"workhorse\" of the British Army, the MAN Logistic Support Vehicle is used to deliver food, fuel and other supplies to troops. The fleet was withdrawn from service following a recent exercise named Titan Storm on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, when faults were discovered in the propshaft of some vehicles, which delivers power to the wheels.  All 6,000 vehicles, some of which have been in service for nearly 20 years, are being fitted with replacement parts after some were damaged because they were fitted incorrectly, according to BFBS Forces News.Pollard told MPs: \"It's pretty standard fare, right across our military platforms, for there to be safety notices issued and rectification work taking place.\"He added: \"With the platforms we have, the age of some of them, and the usage for them, there's updates required on a regular basis.\"Pollard was also questioned by MPs about a separate incident on the Titan Storm exercise, which led to the suspension of the Army's Ajax armoured fighting vehicles.About 30 soldiers training to use the Ajax vehicles became unwell because of noise and vibration, with some seen emerging from the vehicles vomiting.Pollard told the committee \"none of them required hospitalisation\" and \"many of them have returned to their normal duties\".But he added: \"I have always been clear that the safety of our people is our top priority, that's why we have paused operations.\"It comes weeks after Pollard claimed the much-delayed £6.3bn Ajax programme had \"left its troubles behind\" and was ready to be deployed with squadrons on operations. Pollard said he had made this statement after receiving written confirmation from the chief of the general staff and the national armaments director saying Ajax was \"demonstrably safe to operate\".He said the Army had launched an investigation into what happened with the Ajax vehicles during the Titan Storm exercise, which he said would be reporting \"very shortly\".The Defence Accident Investigation Branch has also launched an investigation which would take longer to report, Pollard told MPs.And he said he had launched a separate review into the reassurances he had been given by officials about the vehicles' safety.Asked if he had been misled about their operational readiness, he said:  \"Until I see the findings of the preliminary report into what happened, I don't want to make a judgement on the process that led up to it.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoDavid GrittenReutersPope Leo said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the site of the Beirut port blastPope Leo XIV led a silent prayer at the site of the Beirut port explosion and demanded justice for its victims, as he wrapped up his three-day visit to Lebanon.He also met some relatives of the 218 people who were killed by the massive blast on 4 August 2020, which devastated a large part of the capital.Later, the Pope said he was \"deeply moved\" by his visit to the port and shared \"the thirst for truth and justice, of so many families, of an entire country\".No-one has yet been held accountable for the disaster, which happened when a fire triggered the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a port warehouse for almost six years.It is widely believed that officials and politicians were aware of the combustible chemical's existence and the danger it posed but that they failed to secure, remove or destroy it.Victims' relatives and activists say the domestic investigation into the disaster has been hampered by the political leadership's efforts to shield those responsible from scrutiny.Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was \"very important\". \"We know that he raises his voice for justice, and we need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion,\" she added.Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, said: \"He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, in his way, maybe in praying and maybe in just looking at us... We, the families, now, after five years, we need people to look at us.\"EPAAn estimated 150,000 people gathered at Beirut's waterfront for the Pope's final Mass in LebanonAfter praying at the blast site, the Pope celebrated the final Mass of his trip in front of an estimated 150,000 people gathered on Beirut's waterfront.Addressing the crowd, he lamented that the beauty of Lebanon had been \"overshadowed by poverty and suffering, the wounds that have marked your history\".But he appealed to the country's diverse communities to unite to solve its problems.\"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions, open our religious confessions to mutual encounter and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon,\" he said. \"A Lebanon where peace and justice reign, where all recognise each other as brothers and sisters.\"Returning to Rome on Tuesday, the Pope told reporters that Lebanon was an example of \"a land where Islam and Christianity are both present and are respected\".He later added: \"I think those are lessons that would be important to be heard in Europe or North America - that we should perhaps be a little less fearful, and look at ways of promoting authentic dialogue and respect.\"Since the last papal visit in 2012, Lebanon has been plagued by multiple crises.In 2019, the country suffered one of the worst economic depressions recorded in modern times, which pushed millions into poverty.It was followed by mass anti-government protests, the coronavirus pandemic, and then the Beirut port explosion.Political paralysis prevented the country from passing the economic and structural reforms demanded by foreign donors in return for billions of dollars in aid.Lebanon was later devastated by the 13-month war between the Shia Muslim Hezbollah movement and Israel, which killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis.A ceasefire ended the conflict a year ago, but Israel has continued to attack targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, accusing the Iran-backed group of trying to rearm.Additional reporting by Aleem Maqbool",

    "body": "Andrew won't get any money back after Royal Lodge move4 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentPA MediaAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is expected to leave Royal Lodge next yearAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is unlikely to receive any compensation upon leaving Royal Lodge in Windsor, according to information published by the Public Accounts Committee.As part of his leasing arrangement, Andrew could have been entitled to £488,000 for an early surrender of his 75-year lease.But a report from the Crown Estate for MPs on the public spending watchdog says that the property is so dilapidated and in need of repairs that in \"all likelihood\" Andrew \"will not be owed any compensation\".There will now be an MPs' inquiry launched into the Crown Estate and its royal leases, says committee chair, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown.Sir Geoffrey said the information from the Crown Estate \"clearly forms the beginnings of a basis for an inquiry\" which will begin next year and will consider the Crown Estate and property leases with the Royal Family.It is not known yet whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor will be called to give evidence.ShutterstockPrince Andrew had a 75-year lease on Royal Lodge on the Windsor estateThe information supplied by the Crown Estate also showed Andrew handed in his notice on the property on 30 October, the day it had been announced he had lost his titles.He gave a year's notice, so could stay for another 10 months, but it has been expected that he will move from Royal Lodge to Sandringham in Norfolk early next year.There was also evidence that Andrew still had a lease on part of his former home at Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, with the Crown Estate saying he was still the leaseholder of East Lodge, which has a separate lease from the main house, which Andrew sold in 2007.The East Lodge was said by the Crown Estate to have been leased by Andrew for a \"member of staff\".MPs on the cross-party committee had wanted to know the details of Andrew's financial arrangements for Royal Lodge and whether taxpayers' interests had been properly protected.Andrew had taken on a 75-year lease of Royal Lodge in 2003, paying over £8.5m up-front to cover renovation costs and paying in advance to remove any requirement for rent, based on a notional rent of £260,000 per year.There was also a token \"peppercorn\" payment, which the Crown Estate notes is standard practice for long leases, where there's an advance payment in lieu of rent.A clause allowed him to get some of his advance payments back if he left within 25 years, but that depended on the property being maintained.The report says the current condition of Royal Lodge is \"not out of keeping with a tenancy of this duration\", but the cost of repairing \"dilapidations\" meant any payback was unlikely.Overall, the terms of the Royal Lodge deal were \"fair, reasonable and in line with market practice\", says a letter from the Crown Estate commissioners to MPs.The spending watchdog also published information about Forest Lodge, the Prince and Princess of Wales's new home in Windsor, saying it had been taken on a 20-year lease from the Crown Estate.The couple, who moved in this autumn, are described as paying an \"open market rent\" using levels agreed by independent valuers.There had been pressure on Andrew, 65, to move from his Windsor home for over a year, in what had become known as the Siege of Royal Lodge.King Charles had stopped financial support for his brother, but Andrew had a private lease that he had previously shown no signs of relinquishing.But following a growing public outcry about his links to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDominic Casciani,Home and legal correspondentandTom McArthurJury trials in England and Wales for crimes that carry a likely sentence of less than three years will be scrapped, the justice secretary has announced.The reforms to the justice system include creating \"swift courts\" under the government's plan to tackle unprecedented delays in the court system.Serious offences including murder, robbery and rape will still go before a jury, and volunteer community magistrates, who deal with the majority of all criminal cases, will take on even more work.David Lammy said the reforms were \"bold\" but \"necessary\", but the Conservatives described the plans as the \"beginning of the end of jury trials\".Retired Court of Appeal judge Sir Brian Leveson was asked by the Lord Chancellor to come up with a series of proposals to reduce the backlog in the courts, in a process which began back in December 2024.These proposals included jury-free trials and more out-of-court settlements like cautions.In July, Sir Brian said \"fundamental\" reforms were needed to \"reduce the risk of total system collapse\".A previous version of the plan, leaked to the BBC and the Times last week and based on Sir Brian's proposals, was to end jury trial for most crimes attracting sentences of up to five years.But announcing the reforms in the Commons on Tuesday, David Lammy retreated from the most radical reforms.Lammy said the new system would get cases dealt with a fifth faster than jury trials.He added that it was necessary as current projections have Crown Court case loads reaching 100,000 by 2028, from the current backlog of almost 78,000.This means that currently a suspect being charged with an offence today may not reach trial until 2030. Six out of 10 victims of rape are said to be withdrawing from prosecutions because of delays.A defendant's right to a jury trial would be restricted to prevent them from \"gaming the system\", Lammy also said.The reforms to the jury process will remove the right for defendants to ask for a jury trial where a case can be dealt with by either magistrates or a new form of judge-only Crown Court.Defendants facing fraud and complex financial crime accusations will no longer get a jury trial - a recommendation made to the government earlier this year by a retired senior judge.There are around 1.3m prosecutions in England and Wales every year, and 10% of those cases go before a Crown Court. Of those, three out of 10 result in trials.The reforms appear to mean that more than two out of 10 will still go before a jury. Critics of restrictions to trial by jury - including almost all barristers - say it won't have any impact on the backlogs because the real problem has been cuts to the Ministry of Justice.Evidence also shows that ethnic minorities believe they get a fairer hearing with juries, than with magistrates alone.Lammy has previously said that cutting juries would be a mistake, but told the BBC ahead of the announcement that the \"facts had changed\" and the government needed to bring in reforms to clear the backlog.Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick accused Lammy of \"scrapping the institution he once lauded\".He told the Commons: \"Why on earth does this justice secretary think he has a mandate to rip up centuries of jury trials without even a mention of it in his party's manifesto?\"Lammy, in response, said the changes were needed because the previous government had cut court sitting days - and magistrates already deal with the vast majority of UK trials.Legislation would need to be introduced to bring in the changes.Abigail Ashford, a solicitor advocate with Stokoe Partnership, who represents clients in the Crown Court, said the reforms risked trust in justice.\"Judge-only trials risk deepening existing inequalities and eroding confidence among communities who already feel marginalised,\" she said.\"In complex or sensitive cases, removing the community from assessing credibility and fairness undermines trust in a way that cannot be compensated for by concentrating decisions in the hands of a single judge.\"The Criminal Bar Association, which represents specialist criminal barristers in England and Wales, criticised the changes and said they brought \"a wrecking ball to a system that is fundamentally sound and has been in place for generations\". \"Juries work – they do their job superbly, and without bias,\" it said in a statement. \"Juries have not caused the backlog.\"Chair Riel Karmy-Jones KC also expressed concern \"about the lack of detail provided in David Lammy's comments\".Tom Franklin, chief executive of the Magistrates' Association, said the increased powers for magistrates was a \"big vote of confidence\" but more resources were needed for courts including enough trained, well-paid legal advisers, and repairing crumbling buildings.He also pressed the case for the new swift courts to include two magistrates passing sentences with a judge, as originally proposed by Sir Brian, so that \"ordinary people\" are involved in both verdict and sentencing.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKristian JohnsonMomentoJpegOfsted warns unregistered care homes can sometimes charge \"exorbitant fees\"Nine in 10 councils across England are placing children in unregistered homes which can charge up to £30,000 a week per child.The findings, published in Ofsted's annual report, describe how local authorities often cannot find places in registered homes to cater for children's needs, despite the number of care homes being at a record high.Ofsted chief inspector Sir Martyn Oliver described the situation as an \"ongoing national scandal\".The Children's Homes Association (CHA), which represents residential childcare providers, said there is no clear national plan and that it is up to the government to \"fix the system\".There were 4,010 registered children's care homes across England in 2024/25 - a 15 per cent rise since the year before and the highest on record.But Ofsted said there is an \"ongoing imbalance\" as some providers choose to open care homes where houses are cheaper, regardless of the local demand. Twenty six per cent of children's homes are in the north west of England, but only 18 per cent of looked-after children live in the region.Sir Martyn says this \"strong profit motive... bends the system out of shape\".\"The rapid growth in the number of homes masks very significant problems with location, affordability and suitability,\" he added.According to Ofsted, the lack of available places in legitimate settings has led to a shadow market of illegal care homes which charge \"exorbitant fees\".In the past year, Ofsted launched 870 investigations into these settings, with 680 found to be unregistered.It is a criminal offence for providers to operate a home without registration.Currently, Ofsted can only issue warning letters and does not have the power to issues fines.However, this is expected to change under new legislation as part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill.Councils' overall spend on children in care homes has risen from £3.9bn in 2015-16 to £8.1bn in 2023-24.Sir Martyn described this as \"a crisis\", with council budgets unable to keep pace with the \"spiralling costs\" of children in care.\"The government must work with local authorities to drive out all use of unregistered children's homes,\" he said.A Local Government Association spokesperson said the \"astronomical cost\" of children's homes means there is less money to help children before they reach care.\"It is extremely concerning that in many cases, a lack of choice means provision is not fully meeting children's needs,\" it added.\"It is absolutely vital that the entire sector works together to ensure that we have enough homes that can meet children's needs. This includes central and local government, Ofsted, the NHS and providers in all sectors.\"CHA chief executive Dr Mark Kerr said unregistered homes are the result of a failed system and wants more government help for children with the most complex and high-risk needs.\"Those 'exorbitant fees' are the crash-landing of a system that hasn't been planned or funded properly,\" he said.\"If ministers want homes in different places, they need to change the planning rules, fix registration delays and set out a credible regional plan. At the moment, geography follows bureaucracy, not children's needs.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan Youngs,Culture reporterandMark Savage,Music correspondentReutersSean Combs is currently serving a 50-month prison sentenceLawyers for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs have hit out at a new Netflix documentary produced by rapper 50 Cent, which they say is \"a shameful hit piece\" that \"relied on stolen footage\".The four-part documentary, titled Sean Combs: The Reckoning, was released on Tuesday and is billed as a \"staggering examination\" of the hip-hop mogul, who was convicted on prostitution-related charges earlier this year.It includes what Netflix described as \"explosive\" footage of Combs filmed in the days before his arrest, including a phone conversation with his lawyers.The director said she obtained the footage legally, but Combs' spokesman said it was \"fundamentally unfair, and illegal\" to use his private footage.'Personal vendetta'He also said it was \"staggering\" that Netflix had given creative control to 50 Cent, who he described as \"a longtime adversary with a personal vendetta\".\"Netflix is plainly desperate to sensationalise every minute of Mr Combs's life, without regard for truth, in order to capitalise on a never-ending media frenzy,\" the statement said.\"If Netflix cared about truth or about Mr Combs's legal rights, it would not be ripping private footage out of context - including conversations with his lawyers that were never intended for public viewing. No rights in that material were ever transferred to Netflix or any third party.\"The statement added: \"For Netflix to give his life story to someone who has publicly attacked him for decades feels like an unnecessary and deeply personal affront. At minimum, he expected fairness from people he respected.\"The documentary opens with footage of Combs in a hotel room six days before arrest in September 2024, talking on the phone to attorney Marc Agnifilo and telling him he wants to \"fight for my life\".Pushing Agnifilo to have a more upfront media strategy to protest his innocence, Combs told him: \"We have to find somebody that'll work with us. It has to be somebody that has dealt in the dirtiest of dirtiest of dirty business of [the] media and propaganda.\"At another point, viewers see Combs talking to his son Justin on the phone five days before his arrest. \"God told me to do nothing... [but] other people need to do something 'cause this is ridiculous,\" he said in the clip.Combs' spokesman said the documentary contained footage that was \"never authorised for release\".\"As Netflix and CEO Ted Sarandos know, Mr Combs has been amassing footage since he was 19 to tell his own story, in his own way. It is fundamentally unfair, and illegal, for Netflix to misappropriate that work.\"Netflix has not responded to a request for a response but pointed US media to comments it has published from the documentary's director Alexandria Stapleton.\"It came to us, we obtained the footage legally and have the necessary rights,\" she said. \"We moved heaven and earth to keep the film-maker's identity confidential.\"The documentary is executive produced by Curtis \"50 Cent\" Jackson, whose long-running feud with Combs stretches back two decades.Jackson told ABC News' Good Morning America on Monday: \"If I didn't say anything, you would interpret it as that hip-hop is fine with his behaviours. There's no-one else being vocal.\"The documentary covers Combs' career as one of the most powerful men in hip-hop, and includes allegations that he was involved in the murder of rapper Tupac Shakur in 1996.It features tapes of a police interview in which former gang member Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis claims that Combs offered him $1m (£769,000) for a hit on Shakur.Mr Davis is set to stand trial for Shakur's murder in 2026. He now says his proffer agreement with police, under which he agreed to tell them what he knew but it couldn't be used against him in court, was given under duress, according to Netflix.The programme also includes Kirk Burrowes, who co-founded Bad Boy Entertainment with Combs, claiming that he believes Combs \"had a lot to do with the death of Tupac\".Combs has always denied any involvement in Shakur's death.The documentary also features further claims of violence and threats, many of which have previously been made public in dozens of lawsuits, including alleged abuse against former girlfriend Cassie, which ended in a settlement.Combs has previously denied the complaints, calling them \"sickening\" and \"full of lies\".In a media statement earlier this year, his lawyers said \"anyone can file a lawsuit\", adding: \"No matter how many lawsuits are filed it won't change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor.\"The documentary also includes interviews with two jurors from Combs' trial.In July, he was convicted on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution but found not guilty of the most serious charges - racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking of two ex-girlfriends.He is now serving a 50-month prison sentence and has said he will appeal.",

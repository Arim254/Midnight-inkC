    "body": "2 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson has said that he refused to give police his mobile phone Pin when he was stopped at the entry to the Channel Tunnel because it had \"journalist material\" on it, a court has heard.Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was charged under the Terrorism Act after allegedly failing to comply with the counter-terrorism powers in Folkestone in July 2024.He is on trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court and has pleaded not guilty.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.Robinson's trial began on Monday and is expected to last two days. He is charged under his real name and is being referred to as Mr Lennon in court.Before the hearing, the former English Defence League (EDL) leader addressed his X followers in a video taken while en route to court.He said the social media platform's billionaire owner Elon Musk - who has previously championed Mr Lennon - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Musk has not publicly confirmed this.In court, the 42-year-old sat in the dock wearing a navy waistcoat and tie.PC Mitchell Thorogood, a counter-terrorism officer with Kent Police, told the court that he was on duty policing vehicles travelling to France at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel near Folkestone on 28 July 2024.He described seeing a silver Bentley, an \"unusual car to come through\", with a lone occupant - Mr Lennon.PS Farmer, who was supervising the officers at the Channel Tunnel entrance that day, told the court that Mr Lennon had said he was delivering a friend's \"extremely high value\" Bentley Bentayga to Benidorm.Both he and PC Thorogood told the court they were suspicious of the account Mr Lennon gave them.\"He was travelling a far distance with a vehicle that wasn't his,\" PC Thorogood said.He added that Mr Lennon did not make eye contact with him during the exchange and had told him that he had not bought a ticket in advance, which the officer described as \"unusual\".PC Thorogood also described detaining Mr Lennon under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. He said Mr Lennon started filming him, and the officers took away his mobile phone.\"He refused to provide the Pin number, saying there was journalist material in his phone,\" PC Thorogood said.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that Mr Lennon had used an expletive at officers and had told them that his phone contained information about \"vulnerable girls\".\"The process by which journalistic material would be protected was explained to him,\" Ms Morris said.She told the court the officers had also found a small bag in the Bentley containing £13,370 and €1,910 (£1,660).District Judge Sam Goozee said the defendant's address should not be published, after his barrister Alisdair Williamson KC said there were \"credible threats against Mr Lennon's life\".Mr Williamson told the judge that he did not expect his client to give evidence in his defence.The public gallery at the back of court was packed with more than 30 of his supporters, who had queued from early morning. One was wearing a red Mega (Make England Great Again) baseball cap.The trial continues.",

    "body": "Prisoner questioned over schoolgirl's 1994 murder3 hours agoJulia BrysonYorkshirePA MediaLindsay Rimer was found dead five months after she went missing from home A prisoner has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of a 13-year-old girl who was found dead months after she went missing from her home in 1994. Lindsay Rimer left her home in Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, on 7 November to buy cornflakes from a nearby shop but never returned. In April 1995, her body was found in the Rochdale Canal, about a mile from the town, weighted down with a stone.West Yorkshire Police said a man was arrested on Monday at an unnamed UK prison where he was serving a sentence for other offences.A force spokesperson said officers were \"keeping Lindsay's family updated\", adding that the arrest was \"as a result of our continued focus on progressing the investigation\".The arrested man would be interviewed by police on Monday and Tuesday and was expected to be bailed and returned to prison while inquiries continued, the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, officers were approaching \"a number of specific potential witnesses, mainly in the Hebden Bridge and wider Halifax area\", who had been identified by the investigation.West Yorkshire Police confirmed that Monday's arrest was the first in the investigation into Lindsay's murder since 2017.West Yorkshire PoliceCCTV images show Lindsay buying cornflakes shortly before she disappearedOn the night Lindsay went missing in November 1994, she had left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT before calling in to see her mother at the Trades Club, a members club and music venue in Hebden Bridge.She was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes from the Spar shop on Crown Street.Lindsay Rimer: The girl who went to buy cornflakes and never came homeThe last confirmed sighting of Lindsay was not long after this, as she was seen leaning against a wall near the Memorial Garden.Her body was found by two canal workers the following spring.The search for the schoolgirl was one of the largest carried out by West Yorkshire Police. Lindsay's family has described not knowing what happened to her as \"like living a life sentence\".Alex Moss/BBCDet Ch Insp James Entwistle said police remained committed to the investigation into Lindsay's murderConfirming the new arrest, Det Ch Insp James Entwistle, senior investigating officer, said: \"We remain very firmly committed to doing everything we can to get justice for Lindsay, and to give her family the answers they still so desperately need after all these years.\"While we appreciate the understandable public interest that today's arrest will bring, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.\"Det Ch Insp Entwistle added: \"Although it is now more than 30 years since Lindsay was murdered, we remain convinced there is someone out there who has vital information that could finally help to ease her family's pain.\"We urge them do the right thing and tell us what they know.\"Anyone with information that could help the investigation was asked to contact West Yorkshire Police.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "2 hours agoAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of being Chinese spiesThe government is facing questions after a case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed, just weeks before the trial was due to go ahead.In September, prosecutors unexpectedly dropped the charges, sparking a political row over who was to blame.The background to the case is complicated - so here we try and walk you through how we got here and the political impact.What was the case about?Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry - who have both consistently maintained their innocence - were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.Why did it collapse?Last week, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.In a rare intervention, Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who is the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said the CPS had tried to obtain further evidence from the government \"over many months\" but witness statements did not meet the threshold to prosecute.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men in April 2024, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.What was the political fallout?Downing Street has insisted the decision to drop charges was made by the CPS, with no ministers or members of the government involved. The government has maintained that it is frustrated the trial collapsed.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has also sought to shift the focus to the previous Conservative government, which was in power when the alleged offences took place.He argued the prosecution could only be based on the Tory government's position at that time, when he says China was not designated a \"threat to national security\".Current Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has rejected this claim, pointing out that a number of former senior security and legal officials have also questioned the government's argument.Several former Conservative ministers and advisers have told the BBC there was no official designation of whether a country amounts to a threat.However, they claim there are hundreds of examples of Chinese activity posing a threat to the UK at the time of the alleged offences, which could have been given as evidence.The Tories have suggested that the PM's national security adviser Jonathan Powell, who has sought closer relations with Beijing, failed to give the CPS the evidence it needed to secure convictions.Ministers have insisted Powell had no involvement in the substance or evidence of the case.Why is this a problem for the government?Badenoch has accused the government of deliberately collapsing the trial because \"the prime minister wants to suck up to Beijing\" - something it has denied.Since last year's general election, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China to help achieve its aim of growing the economy.Then-Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Powell have all visited the country over the past year.The government has insisted its approach to China is rooted in the UK's national interests.However, Badenoch has claimed that following the collapse of the case it seems the PM has been \"too weak to stand up to Beijing on a crucial matter of national security\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe president of Germany will visit the UK later this year, Buckingham Palace has announced.The visit by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, from 3 to 5 December, will be the first German state visit to the UK in 27 years.King Charles and Queen Camilla will host the visit at Windsor Castle as Buckingham Palace is undergoing renovations.Such state visits are used to reinforce alliances and to encourage trade, with the German trip following last month's state visit by US President Donald Trump.State visits are a mix of political and business meetings, alongside royal pageantry and a diplomatic red-carpet welcome, with a banquet, military parade and carriage rides.The visit follows a treaty between Germany and the UK signed in the summer, known as the Kensington Treaty, which agreed to create a direct rail link between London and Berlin, as part of measures bringing the countries closer together.There are plans for more cultural ties such as school exchanges, stronger military links, business investments and joint efforts to tackle illegal migration and people smuggling.The King and Queen will be returning the hospitality to President Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender for their own visit to Germany in March 2023, in what was the first overseas state visit of the new reign.That first visit as King proved to be a diplomatic success, with the King making a well-received speech to the German Bundestag in Berlin, where he spoke about the importance of Germany's efforts in supporting Ukraine after the invasion by Russia.In a symbolic moment of reconciliation, he also went to Hamburg where he laid a wreath remembering those who had died in the Allied bombing of the city during the Second World War.The last German state visit to the UK was in December 1998, by President Roman Herzog, where he became the first head of state to visit Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992.Queen Elizabeth II hosted the visit and her state banquet speech spoke of the importance of both countries belonging to international organisations, \"headed by the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation\", which helped \"to extend our reach and achieve goals which would be impossible on our own\".In that 1998 speech, which would have been written with the advice of the government, she also expressed the hope that Germany would become a permanent member of the UN Security Council - which so far has not happenedThe announcement of the 2025 German state visit adds to what is already a busy autumn schedule for the King, who is still undergoing cancer treatment.The King and Queen will be travelling to meet Pope Leo next week, for a rearranged state visit to the Vatican. A previously planned visit was postponed because of the ill-health of the late Pope Francis.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHarry Sekulich andLaura GozziUS President Donald Trump is considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.Asked by reporters on Air Force One on Sunday whether he would provide Kyiv with Tomahawks, Trump replied: \"We'll see... I may\". The missiles would be \"a new step of aggression\" in Ukraine's war with Russia, he said.The comments follow a phone call at the weekend between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who pushed for stronger military capabilities to launch counter-attacks against Russia.Moscow has previously warned Washington against providing long-range missiles to Kyiv, saying it would cause a major escalation in the conflict and strain US-Russian relations.Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach of Ukraine.Trump's attitude to Russia has hardened in recent months as he has become impatient with Vladimir Putin's lack of cooperation in reaching a ceasefire deal with Kyiv.  \"I might tell them [Russia] that if the war is not settled, that we may very well, [send Tomahawks to Kyiv] we may not, but we may do it,\" he said.\"Do they [Russia] want Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so,\" the US president added.On Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the topic of Tomahawks was of \"extreme concern\" to Russia. \"Now is really a very dramatic moment in terms of the fact that tensions are escalating from all sides,\" he said.In September Peskov had dismissed the threat of Tomahawks, saying they would not be able to \"change the dynamic\" of the war.But in his comments on Sunday he noted that if Tomahawks were launched at Russia Moscow would not be able to tell whether they were carrying nuclear warheads. \"What should the Russian Federation think? Just how should Russia react?\", he said.On Monday morning former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev doubled down on Peskov's comments. \"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on social media.\"The delivery of these missiles could end badly for everyone. And first of all – for Trump himself,\" he wrote.Medvedev, who over the last few years has grown into an increasingly hawkish figure, frequently posts on social media espousing more extreme positions than the Kremlin's. He and Trump have sparred online before. Comments by Medvedev in August led Trump to say he had ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia.Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, Kyiv has made multiple requests for long-range missiles, as it weighs up striking Russian cities far from the front lines of the grinding conflict.In their recent phone calls, Zelensky and Trump discussed Ukraine's bid to strengthen its military capabilities, including boosting its air defences and long-range arms. Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have repeatedly come under heavy Russian bombardment with drones and missiles. Russia has particularly targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure as winter approaches, causing widespread power cuts. Last month, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg suggested the US president had authorised strikes deep into Russian territory, telling Fox News \"there are no such things as sanctuaries\" from attacks in the Russia-Ukraine war.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterBettmann / GettyWoody Allen and Diane Keaton in Annie HallUS actor and filmmaker Woody Allen has paid a lengthy, glowing tribute to Diane Keaton who died on Saturday aged 79.Writing in The Free Press, Allen described Keaton as \"unlike anyone the planet has experienced or is unlikely to ever see again,\" adding that \"her face and laugh illuminated any space she entered\".In a long personal essay, Allen recalled first meeting Keaton in 1969 during rehearsals for his play Play It Again, Sam before going on to make eight films with her including Annie Hall, which she won best actress for at the 1977 Oscars.\"As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,\" wrote Allen.\"I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it.\"In Annie Hall, Keaton played the role of the film's quirky, insecure and free-spirited titular star, who Allen's character, Alvy Singer, falls in love with.The pair were at one point romantically involved in real life.Reminiscing on the first time they met, Allen remembered thinking: \"If Huckleberry Finn [writer Mark Twain's fictional vagabond] was a gorgeous young woman, he'd be Keaton.\"He added that the world was now a \"drearier\" place without her in it.\"Still, there are her movies. And her great laugh still echoes in my head.\"She starred in other Allen titles such as Manhattan, Sleeper and Radio Days.Silver Screen Collection / ContributorThe pair pictured together on the set of comedy film Sleeper in 1973Keaton remained a supporter of Allen, a controversial figure, who was accused of molesting his daughter Dylan, which he has always denied.No charges have ever been brought against the star.She told the Guardian in 2023: \"He gave me everything. He really did. Woody made it loose. That helped me enormously.\"Silver Screen Collection / ContributorLos Angeles-born Keaton shot to fame through her role as Kay Adams-Corleone in the Godfather films, before going on to feature in movies like Father of the Bride and Fellow First Wives Club.Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, like fellow US filmmaker Allen, also paid tribute to the \"extraordinary\" actress over the weekend.In a post shared on social media, Coppola said: \"Words can't express the wonder and talent of Diane Keaton. Endlessly intelligent, so beautiful.\"From her earliest performances in Hair and throughout her amazing career, she was an extraordinary actor.\"He continued: \"I saw her in the film Lovers and Other Strangers and knew I had to have her play Kay in The Godfather, (which she told me she based on my wife Ellie) and her wonderful work in Annie Hall, while simultaneously setting a new fashion trend.\"Everything about Diane was creativity personified.\"",

    "body": "25 minutes agoJames FitzGeraldWatch: 'It will be a golden age for the Middle East' - TrumpUS President Donald Trump has told cheering Israeli lawmakers that \"the long and painful nightmare is finally over\", after helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.During the first such address by a US president since 2008, Trump said the day would mark \"the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better\" in the Middle East.Trump's address to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, comes on the day that the last 20 living hostages held in the Palestinian enclave were released by Hamas. Israel is releasing 250 Palestinian prisoners and more than 1,700 other Palestinians detained during the two-year military operations in Gaza.During a whirlwind trip to the region, Trump is also attending a peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and other world leaders.After arriving in Egypt, he said the second phase of negotiations on a peace agreement were under way.During his address to the Knesset earlier in the day, the American president suggested the region was experiencing \"the historic dawn of a new Middle East\". His words echoed the phrasing he used when Israel signed landmark deals with several Arab states during his first presidency.\"At last, not only for Israelis but also Palestinians, the long and painful nightmare is finally over,\" Trump said.Adding to the jubilant atmosphere in the room were politicians' chants of \"Trump, Trump, Trump\". The ceasefire that he helped to broker was \"the most challenging breakthrough of them all, the most challenging breakthrough maybe ever\", the US leader reflected. He indicated that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be his next focus.Trump gave an insight into some of his recent conversations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he felt the Israeli military campaign in Gaza was becoming \"bad\" and \"heated\".\"I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this far more than if you kept this thing going, going, going, kill, kill, kill',\" Trump recalled.His speech was briefly interrupted as an opposition parliament member held up a piece of paper that said \"Recognise Palestine\". At least one person was escorted out of the room.Follow live updatesWho are the released Israeli hostages?Palestinians celebrate return of prisoners freed by IsraelWhat we know about Gaza ceasefire agreementTrump was introduced to parliament by Netanyahu, who saluted his counterpart's various acts of solidarity with Israel. Trump was the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu said. \"Everything changed\" in the American attitude to Israel's military campaign in Gaza when Trump was re-elected as US president last year, Netanyahu added.The Israeli prime minister thanked Trump for his \"unremitting help\" in securing the return of the remaining hostages - part of a group of 251 people seized during the 7 October 2023 attacks in southern Israel by Hamas.Trump went on to offer a tribute of his own to his counterpart, saying: \"He's not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"ReutersTrump was the 'greatest friend' Israel had ever had in the White House, Netanyahu saidThe ceasefire in Gaza took effect on Friday morning after Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of Trump's 20-point peace plan. The next phases are still to be negotiated.Trump has said the ceasefire will hold, and that a \"board of peace\" he is due to head would quickly be set up to administer the territory.In his remarks to parliament, Netanyahu said he was \"committed to this peace\".Also welcomed to the Knesset alongside Trump were other key US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. The names of Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner received particularly loud cheers from Israeli MPs, for their own roles in brokering the ceasefire. Kushner was accompanied by his wife Ivanka Trump.Members of Trump's audience wore red caps. Instead of Trump's signature slogan \"Make America Great Again\", they read \"Trump the Peace President\".Trump was told by the parliamentary speaker that there was \"no-one\" more deserving of next year's Nobel Peace Prize.But some Israeli lawmakers who want the war in Gaza to continue did not attend.Freed hostage Eitan Mor's emotional reunion with family",

Fellow photographer,  Stephen Lovell-Davis, 70, from London, attempted to intervene, but was pushed to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the head.In a statement released at the weekend, the club condemned the actions of some of its supporters in the city, saying it will \"rigorously investigate the events\".Getty ImagesGerman football club FC Schalke 04 described incidents involving fans over the weekend in Dublin as \"completely unjustifiable\" The club, which plays in the German second division, said about 2,000 fans travelled to the Republic of Ireland for their 3–2 defeat in a friendly match against League of Ireland side Bohemians on Saturday.Ms Clarke and Mr Lovell-Davis had both been in Dublin for an exhibition at the Photo Museum Ireland when they came across the group of fans in the city centre. Speaking to BBC News NI, Ms Clarke said she saw several people recording the march, so she grabbed her camera to take some photographs of her own.\"We initially weren't exactly sure what the parade or march was about, but there was chanting and they were banging these loud drums, so we thought it was interesting and worth photographing.\"Ms Clarke said they walked towards them and began taking some photos but quickly realised that the fans were \"incredibly hostile\" and \"seemed to be more of an angry mob rather than a parade\".'Kicked him in the head'\"One of them lunged for me and tried to grab my camera, which was strapped around my neck,\" she said.\"When Steve saw this, he stepped over, and that's when he was pushed to the ground.\"They then kicked him in the head, and he was unable to get up. \"What was most appalling and disgusting was that they just continued to kick him while he was on the ground - it was relentless.\"Getty ImagesThe friendly match between Bohemians and Schalke 04 at Dalymount Park in Dublin ended in a 3-2 loss for the visitorsMr Lovell-Davis told BBC News NI that he cannot remember too much after being struck on the ground, but said he has been left with bruising and cuts around his elbows.\"I am 70 years old, so it is concerning if anything like that does happen, given my age, but I've had worse injuries from my time riding motorcycles, so I think I got off quite lucky,\" he said.\"It's disappointing that a small group of people decided to do that, but I have seen the club's statement that they will try to find those responsible, which is welcome.\"I should stress, however, that this is just a small minority.\"He also thanked three Irish women who rushed to his aid in the aftermath and helped \"patch him up.\"He said he had a fantastic time in Dublin but the incident on Saturday was a disappointing end to their trip.Both Mr Lovell-Davis and Ms Clarke have since flown back to England, and Stephen told BBC News NI that An Garda Síochána (the Irish police service) contacted him about the incident on Monday morning.Club launches internal review processIn a statement released, FC Schalke 04 described some incidents involving fans as \"completely unjustifiable\" and said they had \"overshadowed\" what was intended to be a positive trip with fans. \"We expect everyone who supports and follows the club to behave in a respectful and responsible manner,\" the statement read. \"We utterly condemn these incidents and will rigorously investigate the events and take appropriate action.\"The club added that an internal review process had already begun and expressed sympathy for those affected, wishing them a full recovery.An Garda Síochána said they do not comment on named individuals but said they are carrying out enquiries into an alleged assault at Abbey Street Lower on 11 October.",

They will add to the care we already value. Staffed by GPs and nurses.\"And you won't need to call up for an appointment. That means more people can go after work - when it fits with their lives.\"Swinney promised that the first site would be up and running \"within the year\".PA MediaThe SNP leader was speaking at the end of his party's conference in AberdeenThe first minister also said Scotland was being damaged by a morally wrong \"race to the right\" by parties at Westminster.He said this had led to an \"80 per cent fall\" in the number of overseas nurses the NHS was able to recruit and the shutdown of a visa route for care home staff.Swinney said: \"Thousands of care workers here in the UK entirely legally have been left high and dry. \"Unable to work, while care homes are crying out for staff. In what world does that make any sense?\"He said the Scottish government would sponsor overseas staff so they can \"work, pay tax and help keep Scotland's care homes running\". Swinney said Scotland's older people \"must not pay the price for Westminster's prejudice\".PA MediaParty members, including Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes, voted in favour of Swinney's plans on SaturdayThe first minister went on to criticise Sir Keir Starmer, who he said had promised to be a left-wing Labour leader but had become a \"right-wing prime minister\".\"Now he's dressing up as Nigel Farage,\" he said.He said Starmer had not produced the progressive policies that had earned Labour its votes.Swinney said he was committed to offering Scotland a \"fresh start\"  through independence.He said it would be \"a modern, outward-looking, inclusive compassionate country. \"Not a devolved nation but the world's newest independent nation.\"On Saturday, SNP members backed Swinney's plan to declare a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election.Swinney told delegates his proposals were the most realistic way of pursuing the goal, based on a precedent which brought about the 2014 referendum.Scotland voted against leaving the UK by a margin of 55.3% to 44.7% in September 2014.Sir Keir Starmer, who would have to agree to any vote, previously said he could not imagine indyref 2 taking place during his time in office.",

Lira arrived at The Big Cat Sanctuary in Smarden, Kent, on 14 March following a campaign by managing director Cam Whitnall, who raised £500,000 to fund her and four other rescued lions.The procedure was carried out on Friday by dentist Peter Kertesz, who has treated about 450 big cats.\"When I examined Lira's jaw and mouth, I could see immediately the broken tooth was severely infected,\" said Mr Kertesz. The Big Cat SanctuaryAmani and Lira are two of the big cats from Ukraine that arrived in MarchHe believed the infection was caused by a trauma sustained more than a year ago, leading to bacteria producing toxins inside the tooth.\"My philosophy is non-human dental problems need to be treated in the most predictable, the least invasive and safest way,\" he said.Mr Kertesz explained as Lira did not need to catch prey, extraction was the most \"sensible and ethical solution\". The sanctuary said the extracted tooth was 8cm (3.14 inches) long, with Mr Kertesz having to remove a pocket of pus from beneath the tooth and close the large wound with seven dissolving sutures. The Big Cat SanctuaryLira's extracted lower right canine tooth was 8cm (3.14 inches) longHe also performed a root canal treatment on the opposing upper canine tooth, which was also found to be infected.Briony Smith, curator at The Big Cat Sanctuary, said the procedure was a \"complete success\". She said the staff had noticed \"a small lump on Lira's jawline\" but it had been impossible to tell \"the extent of the problem\".\"Lira will be a little uncomfortable to begin with, but now that the toxins are out of her body, she will start to feel much better over the coming days,\" added Ms Smith.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "49 minutes agoOlivia IrelandPeter Mandelson led away by police following arrest from Camden homeLord Mandelson has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The Metropolitan Police said a 72-year-old man was arrested at an address in Camden, north London, on Monday and taken to a police station for interview.The arrest follows search warrants at two addresses in the Wiltshire and Camden, a police statement added.The force launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that, while he was serving as a government minister, Lord Mandelson had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Lord Mandelson has not publicly commented in recent weeks on the Epstein files, but the BBC understands his position is he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.On Monday afternoon, he was seen being led away from his London home by plain clothes officers who put him in the back of an unmarked car.The BBC understands his arrest was carried out by officers from the Met's central specialist crime division. Consultations between the police and the Crown Prosecution Service are ongoing.The allegations against Lord Mandelson surfaced after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.An email from 2009 appears to show that Lord Mandelson passed on an assessment by an adviser to the then prime minister Gordon Brown about policy measures, including an \"asset sales plan\". He also appeared to discuss a tax on bankers' bonuses and confirm an imminent bailout package for the Euro on the day before it was announced in 2010. Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025 but was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The government has said it expects to release the first documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment in \"early March\".BBC News understands the government will continue talking to police about which documents can be released, after it was previously suggested an arrest could have implications for that process.The government still wants to be able to publish documents, which it hopes will back up Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's claim that Lord Mandelson had \"lied\" during his vetting process.Darren Jones, chief secretary to the prime minister, told MPs on Monday that records detailing follow-up questions posed by No 10 during the initial due diligence process for the appointment would not feature in the first tranche of published material, due to the \"interest in this document\" from the Met Police. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Lord Mandelson's arrest was \"the defining moment of Sir Keir's premiership\".Badenoch, who said the prime minister was \"weak\", added: \"Watching the man who he appointed to the highest position in our diplomatic service getting arrested by police is an image which I think is going to stay with us for many, many years to come.\"Pool/BBC NewsLord Peter Mandelson being escorted by a police officer outside his homeLord Mandelson has been urged by US politicians to answer questions as part of a Congress investigation into Epstein.He began working for Labour in the 1980s, playing a key role in the New Labour movement and Sir Tony Blair's landslide election victory in 1997.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterBBCThe prime minister has asked his ethics adviser to investigate minister Josh Simons, following claims the think tank he used to run commissioned a report which looked into the background of journalists.Labour Together, which helped Sir Keir Starmer get elected as Labour leader, paid APCO Worldwide at least £30,000 to \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins\" of a Sunday Times story about undeclared donations at the think tank ahead of the 2024 election.Simons has previously said the company had \"gone beyond\" what it had been asked to do by including \"unnecessary information\".Sir Keir had already asked the Cabinet Office to investigate Simons last week.However, more than 20 Labour MPs had called for a \"fully independent investigation\", pointing out that Simons is a minister in the Cabinet Office.The PM's independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Laurie Magnus, investigates alleged breaches of the Ministerial Code so can only look at Simons' actions as a minister and not his time at Labour Together, before he was an MP.The BBC has not seen APCO Worldwide's report in full but sources familiar with its contents have confirmed the details, which were reported by the Sunday Times.Sources told the BBC the US public affairs firm's report included information about journalist Gabriel Pogrund's Jewish beliefs and claims about his ideological position.It also claimed, the sources said, that Pogrund's previous reporting, including on the royal family, \"could be seen as destabilising to the UK and also in the interests of Russia's strategic foreign policy objectives\".In a contract addressed to Simons, seen by BBC News, APCO Worldwide agreed to investigate \"the sourcing, funding and origins\" of the Sunday Times reporting, as well as the journalist, Paul Holden and Matt Taibbi, an American reporter.Responding to an urgent question over the issue in Parliament, Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister Darren Jones said the Cabinet Office investigation had \"established the facts\" around the allegations and reported them to Sir Keir, who had now referred the issue to his independent adviser on ministerial standards.\"The government is committed to protecting freedom of the press and no journalist should ever be intimidated for trying to hold those in power to account,\" he told MPs.Simons has previously said he had asked APCO Worldwide to look into \"a suspected illegal hack\" and claims he wanted to investigate journalists were \"nonsense\".Conservative shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Alex Burghart said the company's report included a \"spurious\" allegation that journalists reporting on Labour Together donations \"had relied on Russian hacking\".He added that the report was circulated to key members of the Labour Party and GCHQ, which said there was no case to answer.\"This looks to all intents and purposes like a deliberate attempt to smear and intimidate journalists whose only crime had been to report that Labour Together had broken electoral law,\" Burghart said.\"As of today, it is very difficult to see how the minister's position is tenable.\"He said the issue should have been referred to the ethics adviser immediately, rather than being dealt with internally by the Cabinet Office, and called for Simons to be suspended while the investigation was ongoing.However, Jones said the adviser could only investigate ministers while they were in office.Labour MPs welcomed the ethics investigation but some called for a wider investigation into Labour Together more broadly, rather than just the actions of Simons.John McDonnell said it needed to \"get the full truth of what went on\" adding: \"This at the moment does not pass the smell test.\"In response Jones said the independent adviser's remit was to investigate ministers and any questions about what happened at Labour Together were a matter for the think tank's board, prompting McDonnell to shout \"whitewash\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesThe government has published plans to reform the special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) system in England - and there are a lot of new terms to get your head around.You might already be familiar with education, health and care plans (EHCPs), but now we're talking about individual support plans (ISPs), too.There will also be \"targeted\", \"targeted plus\" and \"specialist\" layers of support, as well as new national inclusion standards.All of these phrases will become crucial to anyone working out how they'll be affected by the new system, which the education secretary says will get support to children with SEND \"when they need it, as routine and without a fight.\"Here are the key changes that have been announced.1. EHCPs are changingThe big change is that, by 2035, only children with the most complex needs will qualify for EHCPs.They are legal documents that identify a pupil's needs and set out what support they should receive. Local authorities are responsible for ensuring EHCPs are followed.Until 2015, the proportion of pupils with EHCPs in schools was relatively stable at 2.8%. Since then it has nearly doubled to 5.3%.The government is worried that without changes, demand will only grow and it won't be possible to meet it.Children who already have an EHCP, or who have been assessed as needing one, will keep them until they finish whichever phase of education they are in - primary or secondary school, for example.At that point – starting from September 2029 - they'll be reassessed.For example, pupils who are now in Year 2 will undergo the reassessments when they reach Year 6.Parents will still be able to apply for EHCPs, which will be delivered by local authorities, and challenge the decisions made about what support their child can get at tribunal.That proportion of children receiving EHCPs is expected to grow in the foreseeable future while the reforms roll out, but the government hopes its changes will mean it happens at a slower rate and will fall back to its current level by 2035. 2. The introduction of ISPsThe government's new vision is that pupils with SEND, including those who don't have EHCPs, will have new ISPs.As a reminder, ISP stands for \"individual support plans\".These documents will set out a child's needs, what support they should receive and what it hopes to achieve.The government described them as \"flexible\" plans that set out what the child needs day to day - as opposed to an EHCP, which is the framework giving them legal entitlement to support.Children with EHCPs will also have ISPs, which will set out how the content of the EHCP will be delivered.All children will have a legal right to an ISP and their nursery, school or college will be responsible for consulting with parents and drawing them up. They will be reviewed at least once a year.If parents are not happy with what's in a child's ISP, they will have to go through a school complaints system first before being able to complain to the local authority, or to the government.3. New ways to work out who gets what supportGot all that? Good.Because those two different documents - EHCPs and ISPs - sit alongside three new layers of support for children with SEND, in addition to what the government is calling a \"universal offer\" for all children.All children with SEND will have an ISP. What the ISP says about their needs determines which layer of support they will receive.There's \"targeted\" support, which might involve pupils receiving help in small groups, and reasonable adjustments such as the provision of coloured paper or laptops for children with dyslexia, for example.Then there's \"targeted plus\" support, which will give a child access to specialists like speech and language therapists and educational psychologists, as well as to  dedicated SEND spaces within schools called \"inclusion bases\".The third level is \"specialist support\", for children with the most complex needs.This is where things get a bit more complicated. When a child receives \"specialist support\", they will be given a \"specialist provision package\", which will be created by education, health and care experts and will spell out what they need.However, only children with \"specialist provision packages\", as part of the specialist support layer, are intended to qualify for new EHCPs. The Department for Education says EHCPs will be \"based on\" those packages and will give children a legal right to the support they set out.The government wants children to be able to switch between these three layers if and when their needs change. And it says by 2028 \"national inclusion standards\" will be in place, setting out what support children and families should be able to expect from schools.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCPolice are investigating whether Jordan James Parke died during a cosmetic procedureTwo people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the death of a man who may have recently undergone a cosmetic procedure, police have said.It is understood the alleged victim is Jordan James Parke, 34, dubbed the \"British Lip King\", who had appeared on television shows to discuss cosmetic surgery he had previously undergone and had faced criticism over his cosmetics business. The Metropolitan Police said it had been called by London Ambulance Service to reports of an unconscious man on Lincoln Plaza, Canary Wharf in east London, on Wednesday, at 12:38 GMT.He was pronounced dead at the scene and his death is currently being treated as \"unexplained\", the force said. On Friday, a 43-year-old man, and a woman, 52, were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were released on bail pending further investigation, police added.A Met spokesperson said his death was currently being treated as unexplained, and an investigation to establish the full circumstances was ongoing.  The spokesperson added officers were \"reviewing information that suggests the victim may have been undergoing a cosmetic procedure prior to his death\" and were waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination, which would be held in due course. In October, a BBC investigation reported that Parke had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after a woman died following a non-surgical BBL procedure. He had not been charged. The investigation also found he had been illegally selling prescription-only weight-loss injections online.",

    "body": "9 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesOfcom has fined a porn company £1.35m for failing to introduce proper age verification measures on its websites.The media regulator said 8579 LLC's sites did not have \"highly effective\" methods to check UK visitors were over 18 and prevent children accessing the content.The fine - Ofcom's largest levied under the Online Safety Act (OSA) so far - comes after it began probing the firm \"within days\" of age check rules taking effect in July 2025.8579 LLC has also been fined a further £50,000 for not responding to Ofcom's information requests.According to Ofcom, the company failed to implement highly effective age checks on most of its porn sites between 25 July and at least 19 November 2025.The regulator says 8579 LLC must implement robust methods to check UK visitors are over 18 on one remaining site before 17:00 GMT on Monday, or face an additional £1,000 daily penalty.George Lusty, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said it had \"been clear\" adult sites needed to deploy robust age checks to protect children in the UK form seeing porn.\"Those that fail to do this – or ignore legally binding requests from us – should expect to face fines,\" he added.The regulator is also requiring 8579 LLC to provide Ofcom with a complete list of all sites it operates, after failing to respond to the regulator's information requests.It risks a further additional daily fine of £250 if it does not comply.Ofcom has already launched probes into many porn sites lacking age checks and handed down decisions, including fines, for some.Ofcom later said AVS had rolled out age checks on some of its porn sites.Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, said the OSA had \"not achieved its goal of protecting minors\".It also said the law had \"diverted traffic to darker, unregulated corners of the internet\".The Act is a set of laws and duties online platforms must follow, that are implemented and enforced by Ofcom.Under its Children's Codes, platforms must also prevent young people from encountering harmful content relating to suicide, self-harm, eating disorders and pornography.",

    "body": "16 minutes agoDominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent PA MediaThe man was wrongly released from HMP Wormwood Scrubs earlier this monthA suspected rapist awaiting trial has been mistakenly set free from prison and has left the country, the BBC has learnt.The man from London was on remand at HMP Wormwood Scrubs, charged with  multiple allegations of rape, sexual assault and violence against a woman.After a pre-trial hearing in early February, a court official wrongly told the prison the defendant could be set free on bail and he was later released, leaving the country soon afterwards.Details of the case emerged as a top judge called on the government to intervene to try to ensure the man returns to stand trial next Monday. The man, who is in his forties, cannot be named for legal reasons.\"We take this error extremely seriously,\" said Judge Martin Edmunds KC, the Recorder of Kensington and Chelsea, in a ruling.\"We will fully investigate how it occurred and what steps can be put in place to prevent it occurring again.\"Isleworth Crown Court heard the defendant, who denies all the charges against him, was remanded in custody after being charged with multiple counts of rape, and was originally due to stand trial in June this year.He appeared in court on 26 January for a hearing to consider whether his trial date should be brought forward to March.Following that hearing, HMP Wormwood Scrubs received a notice from the court stating the defendant had been granted bail.Two passportsOne of the charges he faces did not, on its own, merit remand in custody. But the prison had not been told by the court to continue to detain the man in relation to the more serious charges, including rape.The man was released from prison on 6 February and soon after left the UK for a European country on one of his two passports - the other was being held by the police.The BBC understands that both the man's lawyers and the police have been in contact with the suspect - but he has told them that he cannot return because of complications relating to him having two passports.The judge urged government officials to work out a \"clear, practical\" plan to bring the man back to the UK for trial.A further court hearing is due to take place on Tuesday to determine if the trial in March can take place and whether the defendant will be able to return to the UK.Official figures showed that in the year to March 2025, 262 inmates had been mistakenly let out - a 128% increase on the 115 in the previous 12 months.The government responded to the crisis with promises to improve systems in prisons that deal with releases.More stories like thisRelated internet links",

He could face life in prison without parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors allege that Reiner fatally stabbed his father and mother, Michele, inside a bedroom of their home before fleeing. Reiner, who is being held in custody, will next appear in court on 29 April.Rob Reiner, 78, and Michele Singer Reiner, 70, were found dead in their home by their daughter on 14 December.The couple died from \"multiple sharp force injuries\", according to the LA County medical examiner. Nick Reiner was arrested in Los Angeles the same day. US outlets reported that he and his father had attended a party the previous evening, and engaged in an argument of some kind. Reports vary as to the severity of the alleged row.He faces two counts of first-degree murder, with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders.Rob Reiner directed films including This Is Spinal Tap, the Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally and Stand By Me.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.Getty ImagesRob Reiner (left) pictured with his son Nick in 2016The couple's children, Jake and Romy, said in a statement after their deaths that they were experiencing \"unimaginable pain\" following the \"horrific and devastating loss\".Nick Reiner's arraignment, which was originally set for January, had been postponed after lawyer Alan Jackson withdrew from the case for reasons he said were beyond his and his clients control.His new lawyer, Kimberly Greene, entered the not guilty plea on his behalf on Monday.Reiner is receiving publicly funded legal representation that is allotted to defendants who cannot pay their own fees.",

Set in more than 160 acres near Eyemouth, it is one of only two baronial buildings designed by architect James Gillespie Graham.The castle's history stretches back to a medieval tower house, and its interiors were once decorated by Edinburgh firm Bonnar and Carfrae.Their work had an unlikely brush with literary fame: during a visit in 1873, Mark Twain was so taken with the dining‑room mantelpiece at Ayton Castle that he purchased it. It now sits in the Mark Twain House and Museum in Connecticut.Stories you may have missedThe site also includes a rare 16th Century beehive-shaped dovecot and a private chapel.The previous owners, who bought the property in 2014, carried out substantial refurbishment.As part of that, they built a 600m (1,969 ft) narrow‑gauge railway that runs through part of the grounds, which visitors to the castle can pay to ride.",

Watch: Vehicles set ablaze across Mexico amid violenceEl Mencho was captured on Sunday after forces tracked down a romantic partner he was meeting, according to Mexico's defence secretary.He was seriously injured in a firefight between his bodyguards and the military commandos deployed to capture him.El Mencho died while the military was transporting him from the town of Tapalpa, in Jalisco state, to the capital, Mexico City.At least six of El Mencho's security guards were also killed in the operation, while three members of the Mexican military were injured, the defence ministry said.Security secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch said a prison guard, a member of the state prosecutor's office and 30 members of El Mencho's criminal organisation were killed in the unrest since his death, according to the AFP news agency.Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum has praised the army's operation that led to El Mencho's death and said her priority is to guarantee peace and security across the country.\"There is calm, there is government, there are armed forces and there is a lot of co-ordination,\" Sheinbaum said.As news of El Mencho's death spread, members of his cartel launched attacks in many towns and cities where the CJGN is active.ReutersSmoke billows from burning buses in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, on SundayIn some towns, they blocked roads by throwing spikes and nails on to the tarmac - in others, they commandeered buses and other vehicles then torched them in the middle of the road.Sheinbaum said that the road blocks had been cleared by Monday morning.However, dozens of banks and local businesses have been damaged after they were set alight by cartel members.In many towns, streets were deserted on Sunday as local authorities told residents to seek shelter in their homes.ReutersThe US State Department had offered a $15m (£11.1m) reward for information leading to El Mencho's capture.The Mexican Ministry of Defence said that the raid aimed at capturing El Mencho had been carried out by the Mexican army, with support from the country's National Guard and Air Force.It added that \"complementary information\" provided by the US had helped seize the drug lord but Mexico confirmed on Monday that no US forces were involved in his killing, according to the AFP news agency.",

Xbox also revealed on Friday that Matt Booty - who previously worked under Spencer as corporate vice president of Xbox Game Studios - had been promoted to chief content officer.In a statement on Microsoft's website Booty appeared to try and ease concerns the reshuffle could mean a wider shake-up across Xbox, saying \"there are no organisational changes underway for our studios\".But fans have continued to criticise the appointment of Sharma as Spencer's successor, citing her lack of gaming and industry experience.Some mocked the executive's attempt to prove her credentials by publicly sharing her Xbox Gamertag, showing how many games she has recently played - 29, but all seemingly in the past month.Jez Corden from Microsoft news outlet Windows Central said Sharma's \"expertise in other fields\" and background at firms such as Facebook owner Meta may have helped her secure the top job at Xbox over other executives such as Bond.\"The gaming landscape is struggling to find its footing faced with competition from insta-gratification platforms like Instagram, and TikTok,\" he told the BBC.\"This is where Microsoft has identified weakness in its platform, and opted for Asha's expertise to fill the gap.\"Victoria Phillips Kennedy, news reporter for gaming publication Eurogamer, questioned whether Sharma's background would mean \"we see Xbox be more aggressive in its adoption of AI in the development pipeline\".Sharma has meanwhile said she will not look to \"flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop\" in her new role.\"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us,\" she added.Phil Spencer's Xbox legacyPhil Spencer joined Microsoft as an intern in 1988, working his way up through the company to eventually become chief executive of Microsoft Gaming in 2022.Spencer also launched Xbox Game Pass in 2017, a subscription service allowing players to download and play games on their PC and other devices besides an Xbox.Freelance gaming journalist for IGN and Eurogamer Vikki Blake said it would be \"hard to imagine Xbox without Phil Spencer\".But she told the BBC his departure was not \"completely shocking\" given the brand's recent struggle to remain relevant in a crowded console market and its decision to \"move away from platform exclusives\" with titles such as Halo.In posts on X, Spencer said he felt \"lucky\" to have worked with \"so many passionate creators, partners, colleagues and players across the industry\".\"I'll see you online,\" he added.",

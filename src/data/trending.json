This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "Dan Wootton denies High Court claim that he catfished 'former colleague'37 minutes agoLizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondentGetty ImagesDan Wootton denies the allegations made against himBroadcaster and journalist Dan Wootton has responded to a court claim against him, denying that he catfished a man who says he was a former colleague.Earlier this year, the man filed a case claiming that in 2009 he was tricked by Wootton into sending him explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.He says Wootton did this by sending him sexualised messages, pretending to be a woman called Maria Joseph.In documents filed at the High Court, Wootton denies ever communicating \"via any medium\" with the man, who has been granted anonymity by the court.Wootton also denies that he \"ever has been in possession\" of any \"explicit photographs or video\" portraying the man.Explicit photos and videoThe anonymous claimant has previously told the court that in 2009 Wootton communicated with him via email, SMS and Facebook. The man says that at the time he believed he was communicating with a woman called Maria Joseph, and did not know that he was, in fact, communicating with Wootton, according to the claim.The man says that the messages soon became \"sexualised and flirtatious\", and that Wootton sent him photographs of a female which, he claims, Wootton falsely pretended were of the woman the claimant thought he had been communicating with.He says that some of the photographs showed the female partially or fully naked.The man also said Wootton sent him a video of a man and a woman having sex, again pretending that the female in the video was the woman whom the anonymous claimant thought he was communicating with.Wootton denies the claimsIn documents filed recently at the High Court, Wootton said it was denied that he \"communicated with the claimant via any medium - including email, SMS or Facebook; and denied that he sent the claimant any images or videos\".The anonymous man also previously said in his claim that believing that he was communicating with a woman, he responded to the messages in a flirtatious and sexualised manner.He said Wootton (pretending to be Maria Joseph) encouraged him to send explicit photographs of himself. The man added that \"in the induced belief that he was communicating with Maria Joseph, an unknown female who was interested in a sexual relationship\", and who had already sent explicit images of herself, he was \"persuaded to and did send\" explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.Wootton says in court documents it is denied that he \"was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant\".He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe that the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph. Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: \"Maria (if that is really your name)... we are in a catch 22. i can't play without finding this out. won't tell them as i'm not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then? [sic]\".Pain, injury and humiliationThe anonymous claimant is suing Wootton, saying that he has suffered pain, injury, humiliation and hurt to his feelings. And that he has sustained loss and damage because of Wootton's actions.He says that he has suffered from major depressive order and use of alcohol.Wootton has said that he does not accept that the anonymous claimant has suffered \"any injury as a result of any communication of messages, images, and/or videos between him and 'Maria Joseph'.\"He has denied that he and the man were former colleagues, and said the man's claim should not be allowed, because any case should have been brought years before.",

    "body": "The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution, which endorses Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which the US says multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute to.The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands.The plan \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject,\" the group said on Telegram. \"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.According to reports on the latest draft, part of the ISF's role would be to work on the \"permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups\" - including Hamas - as well as protecting civilians and humanitarian aid routes.This would require Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, to hand over its weapons - something it is meant to do under Trump's peace plan.As well as authorising an ISF, which it says would work with Israel and Egypt - Gaza's southern neighbour - the draft also calls for creation of a newly trained Palestinian police in Gaza. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the Council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarization of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".The ISF is a central plank of Trump's plan which also includes establishing a so-called Board of Peace, which the US president himself is expected to head.Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. The draft also raises the possibility of a Palestinian state - something Israel strongly opposes. A path to future statehood was included following pressure from key Arab states.Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesReselling tickets to live events for a profit is set to be banned by the government.Ministers are expected to announce the plan in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites which offer tickets at several times' face value.Restricting ticket touts was one of the Labour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resale tickets for music and sporting events.The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation.The move, which could be announced on Wednesday, comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music.The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the \"extortionate and pernicious\" websites that exploit fans.Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which? the Football Supporters' Association and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues, and ticket retailers.According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said it was \"great news for music and sports fans\", adding the plan would \"rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans\".She urged the government to \"show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech\".Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as \"another major step forward for fans\".Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Patrick Clahane and Rebecca WearnA paralegal who was secretly filmed telling a BBC undercover reporter how he can help businesses avoid fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, has been sacked.At a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, Zohaib Hussain said he could \"make documents\" including \"business agreements\" for a fee of £3,500 to help dodge immigration fines.His employer, RKS Solicitors, confirmed he had been \"permanently dismissed\" a day after the investigation was broadcast and a \"police report\" had been made.Mr Hussain previously said he categorically denied \"all allegations, insinuations, and claims\".The Home Office announced an \"urgent investigation\" involving the National Crime Agency and multiple police forces following a series of BBC reports into organised criminal networks operating on High Streets the length of Britain.They exposed how a Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts across the UK.Our investigation also uncovered a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could enable illegal working.Following the reports, senior politicians warned that the crime networks were  acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.In one of the investigations, an undercover reporter posed as a mini mart owner who had received a fine from immigration enforcement worth up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, and met with Zohaib Hussain.During the meeting at a solicitor's in Huddersfield, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story.\"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?\"Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: \"Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?\"Mr Hussain went on to explain how to avoid the fine.  He said: \"Sometimes we might have to make documents,\" said Mr Hussain, such as \"business agreements\".Our undercover reporter then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be \"the last resort.\"Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.He said his charges would be £3,500 and he \"would look after us\".During the whole meeting with Mr Hussain, a man known as Shaxawan was present in the room.Shaxawan was revealed by the BBC as a man at the centre of an organised crime network involved in the facilitation of illegal working.He told undercover journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and \"confuse\" immigration enforcement.In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England, including many High Street mini marts.Mr Hussain asked our undercover reporter to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.In a previous statement to the BBC, Mr Hussain said: \"For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.\"He added: \"I have never been involved in, nor have I facilitated, encouraged, or condoned, any form of illegal or improper activity.\"Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied \"every allegation, insinuation and claim made\" in our reporting, and said that he was \"not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity\".In a earlier statement, RKS Solicitors said it had informed the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).\"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.\"The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the \"highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service\".West Yorkshire Police said it \"is working in close partnership with the Home Office, which has assumed primacy for the investigation into the matters highlighted in recent BBC reporting\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoCurtis LancasterSouth of EnglandNetflixRumi, Zoey and Mira are Huntr/x - the K-pop trio who also try and save the world from demonsA school has banned the singing of songs from hit Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters over concerns they are not in keeping with its \"Christian ethos\". Lilliput Church of England Infant School in Poole, Dorset, sent a message to parents on Friday saying some members of the community are \"deeply uncomfortable\" with references to demons. It said this was because they \"associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness\". In an update on Monday, acting head teacher Lloyd Allington said he had since received feedback from parents, highlighting positive messages from the songs, but said the school was seeking to support those who found the themes \"challenging\".KPop Demon Hunters became Netflix's most viewed film ever in August and follows the adventures of fictional K-pop girl band Huntr/x as its three members use their music and fighting skills to protect humans from demons.It also features a rival group made up of five demons called the Saja Boys, whose song lyrics cover themes including temptation and seduction. In the initial message sent to parents, the school asked them to encourage their children \"not to sing these songs at school out of respect for those who find the themes at odds with their faith\".But one parent told the BBC: \"I thought it was ridiculous. My daughter is very into K-pop and her and all of her little friends love it.\"Getty ImagesThe school's head teacher told parents references to demons can feel \"deeply uncomfortable\" to ChristiansHe said they did performances at after-school clubs.\"It's just a harmless, a nice little thing for them to do to get their confidence up,\" he said.He describes himself as an atheist and said it felt like \"a bit of an imposition and probably a bit unfair and silly\".He said nothing like this had happened before and praised the school in general, but felt it had been put under pressure to make the change.In Monday's update, acting head Mr Allington said the school had received feedback from parents who said songs - such as 10-week UK number one single Golden - had helped their children learn about teamwork, courage and kindness.He continued: \"While we fully respect your right to make choices about the content your child engages with at home, we also want to be mindful of the diversity of beliefs within our school community.\"For some Christians, references to demons can feel deeply uncomfortable because they associate them with spiritual forces opposed to God and goodness.\"He added: \"We are not asking parents to tell their children that there is anything wrong with enjoying the film or its songs if it aligns with your own views and beliefs...\"Our role will simply be to help children understand that some of their peers may hold different views and to explore how we can respect and support those peers in upholding their faith.\"More on this story",

    "body": "28 minutes agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Wahiba Ahmed,JerusalemBBCChildren and families will perish, warns Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee CouncilAid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.\"We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,\" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).\"It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.\"With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.  They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday. There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.\"My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,\" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.\"We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.\"Fatima Hamdona (pictured) says her family's food perished in the rainThe story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.\"Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,\" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.  Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.  \"We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.\"A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.  They say they have 44,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.Jan Egeland blames what he calls \"a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire\" running \"counter to all humanitarian principles\" for the hold-up. In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.  However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.Many tents have fallen to pieces, leaving displaced Palestinians without proper shelterMany items, including tent poles, are also classed as \"dual-use\" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.The BBC has asked Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, for details on numbers of imported tents but it has yet to respond.On Sunday it posted on X: \"Over the last few months, in preparation for the winter and protection from the rain, COGAT coordinated with the international community and facilitated close to 140,000 tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip.\"\"We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.\"  It says it is working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that has been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan \"a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter\".International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.\"It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,\" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.  \"They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.\"Displaced Palestinians have nowhere else to go after so much of Gaza was devastated in the warPalestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.\"I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,\" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  \"The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.\"\"Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.\"\"When the rain came, the tents couldn't protect us,\" says Rami Deif AllahIn Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.\"We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,\" he said. \"The water flooded us from above and below.\"Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.\"We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,\" he went on.  \"Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.\"",

    "body": "30 minutes agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countriesThis is part of the Global Women series from the BBC World Service, sharing extraordinary interviews and stories from around the globe.  \"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Cho says she thinks racism stems from poor educationThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.As an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"Getty ImagesIn addition to the film's success, songs from KPop Demon Hunters have dominated the music chartsThe growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers.

    "body": "Snow and ice warnings issued by Met Office as sub-zero temperatures forecastImage source, GettyBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterArctic air has spread across the United Kingdom as temperatures drop with the threat of snow and ice for some.Met Office yellow severe weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued across Scotland and northern England on Tuesday.There are also amber and yellow cold-health alerts, external, issued by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), valid until Friday across northern England and the Midlands.It will turn less cold by the end of the week.Media caption, When and where will it snow?November has so far been exceptionally mild with temperatures 3-6C above average.But that has now changed as a northerly wind is dragging cold Arctic air across the UK with temperatures now falling 3-6C below the mid-November average.Yellow cold-health alerts from the UKHSA are in force across the Midlands and northern England until 08:00 GMT Friday.But more severe amber alerts have been issued for North West, North East, Yorkshire and Humber for the same period.These alerts are mainly for health and social care services, warning of \"significant\" impacts to more vulnerable members of the community.Extra demands may be put on services to deal with the colder weather.The cold weather leads to excess deaths, particularly those over 65 or those with health conditions.  The UKHSA also warns there maybe impacts to some younger age groups too.Image caption, Snow and ice yellow Met Office warnings for Monday night into TuesdayRain is forecast to spread south and east across the UK on Monday night and Tuesday, with the air is cold enough for this to turn to snow for some.A yellow weather warning for snow has been issued for northern and eastern Scotland starting at 03:00 GMT on Tuesday and valid until 18:00.There could be as much as 5-10cm of snow accumulating over the highest ground (above 400m) but even down to lower levels 2-5cm is forecast.The snow could make some higher routes impassable and there could be some disruption to rail journeys.During Tuesday there could also be hill snow in the North Pennines and the North York Moors.Ice will also be a hazard with additional Met Office yellow warnings issued for northern and eastern Scotland - valid from 19:00 Monday to 10:00 GMT Tuesday.An ice warning is also issued for central Scotland and down to northern England from 05:00 to 12:00 GMT Tuesday.Further frequent and heavy snow showers will spread into northern Scotland overnight Tuesday, even to sea level.  These will continue right through until Thursday.With snow accumulating, another Met Office warning for snow and ice is in force for northern Scotland from 18:00 GMT Tuesday to 21:00 Thursday.Frequent snow showers may bring 2-5cm to low levels but as much as 15-20cm is possible above 300m.Gusty winds and lightning with the snow may bring additional hazards.Image caption, Additional Met Office yellow warnings come into force on Wednesday and Thursday as snow and ice threat continuesThe cold northerly wind on Wednesday will blow in snow showers across mostly northern Scotland but also for a time in Northern Ireland, eastern England, west Wales and even the Moors of south-west England.Some of these snow showers could be heavy with thunderstorms - known as 'thundersnow'.Another Met Office yellow warning is in force for snow and ice in coastal areas of eastern England valid 06:00 GMT Wednesday until 18:00 Thursday.Where the snow showers come in frequently from the North Sea, some areas may get 2-5cm at low levels.But over hills above 300m, up to 20cm of settling snow is possible.As temperatures fall below freezing overnight, ice will form.Image caption, Frequent snow showers will come into parts of the UK on Wednesday on a brisk northerly windHow cold will it get?From Wednesday it will feel especially cold for most of us with temperatures of 2-5C but feeling more like minus 2 to 4C when you're in the wind.There will be some overnight frosts and risk of ice where showers fall.Thursday night will be the coldest night this week with temperatures widely falling below zero and down to -12C in rural Scotland.While Friday will start as the coldest morning of the autumn so far with lots of sunshine, we'll start to see a shift away from the cold northerly wind.An Atlantic weather system will slowly come in from the west bringing more cloud and bit of rain and less-cold air.Temperatures by Saturday will rise slightly to average. So while it won't feel as mild as it was last week, it won't be as cold as much of this week will be.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "6 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter PA MediaHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood has unveiled what has been billed as the biggest changes to tackle illegal migration \"in modern times\".The package, modelled on the stricter approach brought in by Denmark's centre-left government, makes refugee status temporary, narrows the appeal process and threatens visa bans on countries that block returns.Here's what we know:Refugee status to become temporaryPeople granted asylum in the UK will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their status reviewed every 30 months.This means people could be returned to their home country if it is judged \"safe\".The scheme mirrors the approach in Denmark, where refugees get two-year permits and must reapply when they expire.The government says it has already started supporting people to return to Syria voluntarily, following the toppling of the Assad regime.It will now start exploring forced returns to Syria and other countries where people have not routinely been removed to in recent years.Refugees will also need to be resident in the UK for 20 years before they can apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain -  up from the current five years.Meanwhile, the government will create a new \"work and study\" visa route, and encourage refugees to find employment or begin education in order to switch onto this route and earn settlement more quickly.Only those on this work and study route will be able to sponsor family members to join them in the UK.Human rights law overhaulThe home secretary also plans to end the process of allowing multiple appeals in asylum cases and replacing it with a single, consolidated appeal where all grounds must be raised at once. A new independent appeals body will be created, staffed by trained adjudicators and supported by early legal advice.To do this, the government will introduce a law to change how the right to family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in migration court cases.Only those with immediate relatives, like children or parents, will be able to remain in the UK in future.A greater weight will be given to the public interest in removing foreign offenders and people who entered illegally. The government will also narrow the application of Article 3 of the ECHR, which bans inhuman or degrading treatment.Ministers say the current interpretation of the law allows multiple appeals against refusals for asylum - including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.The Modern Slavery Act will be tightened to curb last‑minute trafficking claims used to halt removals by requiring asylum seekers to disclose all relevant information early. Any information disclosed later will be treated as less credible.Ending housing and financial supportMahmood will revoke the legal duty to provide asylum seekers with support, ending guaranteed housing and weekly pay.Support would still be available for \"those who are destitute\" but will be withheld from those with permission to work who do not, and from people who break the law or defy removal directions. Those who \"have deliberately made themselves destitute\" will also be denied support.Under plans, asylum seekers with assets will be required to contribute to the cost of their accommodation. This echoes Denmark's approach where asylum seekers must use savings to pay for their accommodation and authorities can seize assets at the border.UK Home Office sources have ruled out confiscating sentimental items like wedding rings, but Home Office Minister Alex Norris has suggested that cars and e-bikes could be targeted.The government has previously pledged to end the use of hotels to hold asylum seekers by 2029, which official figures show cost the government £5.77m per day last year.The government is also consulting on plans to end the current system where families whose asylum claims have been refused continue receiving housing and financial support until their youngest child turns 18. Ministers say the current system creates a \"perverse incentive\" to remain in the UK without status. Instead, families will be offered financial assistance to return voluntarily, but if they refuse, enforced removal will follow.New safe and legal routesAlongside tightening access to refugee status, the UK would create new legal routes to the UK, with an annual cap on numbers.Under the changes, volunteers and community groups will be able to sponsor individual refugees, echoing the \"Homes for Ukraine\" scheme where Britons hosted Ukrainians fleeing war.The government will also expand the work of the Displaced Talent Mobility pilot, set up in 2021, to encourage businesses to sponsor at-risk people from around the world to come to the UK to help fill skills gaps.The home secretary will set an annual cap on arrivals via these routes, based on local capacity. But those arriving on the legal routes will be on a streamlined ten-year route to settlement.Visa bansVisa penalties will be applied to countries who fail to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they takes back its citizens who are in the UK illegally.The UK has already identified three African countries it plans to penalise if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals.The governments of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo will have a month to start co-operating before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed, the Home Office said on Monday. Increased use of technologyThe government is also planning to roll out new technologies to strengthen enforcement.Trials of AI-driven technology to verify the age of asylum seekers, particularly those claiming to be children, will be rolled out more widely.Alongside this, the government plans to introduce a digital ID by the end of Parliament. This will allow more accurate right-to-work checks by employers and make it harder for illegal workers to use fraudulent documents, the government argues.",

    "body": "36 minutes agoJonah FisherEnvironment correspondentJonah Fisher/BBCGrant Mitchell from Severn Trent Water says every day 10 tonnes of wet wipes is removed from sewage at Minworth Wastewater Treatment works Long the scourge of water companies for blocking pipes, a ban on the sale of wet wipes made of plastic will be signed into law later today.The new rules will come into force in 2027 and will bring England into line with legislation across the rest of the UK. Plastic wipes don't disintegrate when flushed down the toilet, so when oil and fat congeal on them, so-called fatbergs form in sewers, which water companies say cost them £200m a year to clear.Most of the wipes that are sold in the UK are now made of non-plastic materials but the government and water companies say they should not be labelled as \"flushable\" because they can still cause blockages.The wet wipe manufacturers contacted by the BBC said their non-plastic \"flushable\" wipes have been thoroughly tested and comply with all the rules. PA MediaLast month, this massive fatberg was removed from a sewer in west London - it weighed 100 tonnes, Thames Water saidFatbergs can become huge if the blockage is not cleared. Just last month a massive stinking lump of wet wipes, fat and oil was removed from a west London sewer. It weighed the same as eight double-decker buses and took a specialist team more than a month to break down.The market for wet wipes has been growing steadily for years. According to government figures in 2023, 32 billion wipes were sold to UK consumers of which about 12 billion contained plastic. If they were all laid out flat that's enough to cover 2,200 football pitches with plastic wipes. Though they welcomed the new legislation for England, water industry sources were also quick to point out its limitations. UK companies will still be able to manufacture and export plastic wet wipes, and they will still be available for people to buy from pharmacies both in person (behind the counter) and online. Businesses like hotels will be allowed to buy the wipes, without restrictions.The medical profession successfully argued for an exemption from the wet wipe ban, arguing that non-plastic wipes absorb too much of the detergents and disinfectants impregnated in them, with potential consequences for patient safety. Where your wet wipes end up when you flush themAt Minworth Wastewater Treatment works in the Midlands the scale of the current problem can be both seen and smelt.Minworth serves a population of more than two million people across Birmingham and the Black Country and Severn Trent, who run the facility, say 10 tonnes a day of wet wipes end up here.\"It's a nightmare,\" Grant Mitchell, Severn Trent's head of blockages says, as we survey a small mountain of wipes.He's just shown us the area where the \"un-flushables\" are filtered out from the sewage. It's grotty stuff. There are dead rats, a rubber duck as well as a huge ball of soiled wipes.\"Wet wipes are a problem because they're made to not break down like toilet paper,\" he says. \"So they stay in one piece, and they gather together with fat, oil, and grease from kitchens, congeal and create a fatberg which causes flooding.\"Also on hand at Minworth is Emma Hardy the Minister for Water and Flooding.\"It's going to make a huge difference,\" Emma Hardy, the Minister for Water and Flooding, said of the ban as we sheltered from the rain at Minworth. \"I think people maybe underestimate the amount of problems that these wet wipes cause.\"Daniel Jolly/University of East AngliaDaniel Jolly from the University of East Anglia has been researching how quickly biodegradable wipes breakdownWhile many brands say their wipes are \"flushable\" and environmentally friendly, whether they can and should be disposed of down the toilet is being questioned.Daniel Jolly is researching how fast these biodegradable wet wipes break down. In a lab at the University of East Anglia in Norwich we watch as he simulates what a toilet flush does to a wipe.\"This isn't toilet paper\" he says as the wipe slowly breaks apart into fibres while he stirs the water inside an tank. \"Even though it's the same basic materials, this is built completely differently and it's much stronger.\"Jolly has been carrying out tests on the banks of the River Yare to see how quickly the plastic-free wipes disintegrate.\"It's a period of most likely months to a year, or two years, depending on the environmental conditions that they're in,\" he says. \"That's much slower than toilet paper which is between weeks to several months, but much better than a plastic wipe which can last hundreds, even thousands of years in certain situations.\"Research commissioned by the government found that some non-plastic wipes failed tests on how fast they disintegrated, meaning they could still block sewers. Jolly is now looking at what impact the biodegradable wipes have on aquatic life as they fall apart. Jonah Fisher/BBCMany non-plastic wipes are now marketed as \"flushable\", but the government and water companies say they should be thrown in the bin after useUntil March 2024 the water companies ran a certification scheme which gave the green light for some wipes to be put in the toilet, called \"Fine to Flush\".  But that was discontinued because of fears it was causing confusion among consumers and replaced with a new slogan \"Bin the Wipe\".Now the advice from the government and the water companies is very clear. Only the three P's - pee, paper and poo should be put down the toilet. \"Restricting the sale of wet wipes containing plastic is a step in the right direction,\" said a spokesperson for Water UK, the industry's trade body. \"But we really need a ban on their manufacture and mandatory 'do not flush' labelling on all wet wipes.\"Some of the manufacturers who market \"flushable\" wipes told the BBC that they were in fact moist toilet tissues, but Water UK said it still viewed them as wet wipes so they shouldn't be flushed. \"I would encourage them [the wet wipe manufacturers] to show leadership on this right now,\" says Minister Hardy. \"Instead of marketing them as being flushable, provide labelling to inform the public that they need to bin them and not flush them down the toilets.\"Additional reporting by Gwyndaf Hughes",

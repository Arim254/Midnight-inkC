for over a year</p><p>The US federal government has shut down for the first time since 2018, and with it the suspension of all non-essential services and the threat of mass firings among federal workers. \nThe shutdown comes after Congress failed to reach an agreement on future spending plans, leading to an angry blame game in the media over who is really responsible. For Democrats, the shutdown presents an opportunity to fight back against Donald Trump’s agenda, in particular on healthcare and cutbacks in spending.  \nBut has the party picked the right moment to challenge the president - and will Democrats be able to land their message with the American public? Justin and Anthony unpack what the Democrats are trying to achieve and where they go from here.   \nAnd, Donald Trump has reached a deal that would transfer ownership of TikTok away from the Chinese company ByteDance and allow operations to continue in the U.S. The deal itself involves investors with close links to the president, but what does it mean for TikTok’s users, and who will have ownership of the app’s powerful algorithms? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

But, at the same time, leaves our own tissues unscathed?</p><p>Our immune system uses white blood cells that look for signs of infection – even viruses and bacteria that it has never met before.</p><p>The cells use sensors – called receptors – that are made randomly in a quadrillion different combinations.</p><p>This gives the immune systems the capability to attack a wide variety of invaders, but the randomness of the process inevitably makes white blood cells that can attack our body.</p><p>Scientists already knew that some of these problematic white blood cells were destroyed in the thymus – where white blood cells mature.</p><p>The Nobel prize this year goes to the discovery of regulatory T-cells – known as the immune system's security guards – which travel the body to disarm any other immune cells attacking the body.</p><p>We know this process fails in autoimmune diseases like type-1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>The Nobel panel added: \"The discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example for cancer and autoimmune diseases.\"</p><p>In cancer, the regulatory T-cells stop the body from fighting the tumour so research is focused on reducing their numbers.</p><p>In autoimmune diseases, trials are looking at boosting regulatory T-cells so the body is no longer being attacked. A similar approach could also be effective in reducing the risks of an organ transplant being rejected.</p></div><div><p>Prof Shimon Sakaguchi, from Osaka University, Japan, performed experiments on mice which had their thymus removed to make them develop autoimmune disease.</p><p>He showed that injecting immune cells from other mice could prevent the disease – suggesting there was some system for preventing immune cells attacking the body.</p><p>Mary Brunkow, from the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, and Fred Ramsdell now at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, were exploring an inherited autoimmune disease in mice and people that led to the discovery of a gene important for how regulatory T-cells function.</p><p>Professor Annette Dolphin, president of the UK's Physiological Society, said: \"Their pioneering work has revealed how the immune system is kept in check by regulatory T cells, preventing it from mistakenly attacking the body's own tissues.</p><p>\"This work is a striking example of how fundamental physiological research can have far-reaching implications for human health.\"</p></div>",

French people are fed up. Macron has put the country in an extremely difficult position,\" she added.</p><p>The decision on how to proceed now rests with Macron, who must surely be asking himself how long this political charade can be allowed to go on.</p><p>He has three options. He can appoint another prime minister. He can once again dissolve the National Assembly. Or he can resign himself.</p><p>The last is the least likely, while the first would be his natural choice.</p><p>However, who now could he name to form a government? Lecornu – the ultimate Macron loyalist – was seen as his last resort, but now he too has failed.</p><p>He could appoint a Socialist, on the basis that the left deserves a go at government - but a Socialist administration would itself not take long to fall.</p><p>So the logic must surely be for option two: for new legislative elections.</p><p>The result would probably be a rout for the pro-Macron centre, and a big victory for the hard-right of Marine Le Pen. But when every other recourse fails, few avenues remain.</p><p>Various French media reported that Macron was not expected to make a statement on Monday, leaving questions swirling over what his next move to break the impasse will be.</p><p>Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years. </p><p>In his brief speech outside the Hôtel de Matignon, the prime minister's residence, which he only occupied for less than a month, Lecornu sharply criticised the \"partisan appetites\" of political factions, who he said \"are all behaving as if they had an absolute majority\". </p><p>\"I was ready for compromise but all parties wanted the other party to adopt their programmes in their entirety,\" he said. </p><p>\"It wouldn't need much for this to work,\" he added, saying, however, that parties needed to be more humble and \"to cast some egos aside\".</p><p>French politics has been highly unstable since July 2024, when Macron called for snap parliamentary elections in a bid to achieve a clear majority following a bruising loss for his party in the European Parliament vote.</p><p>Instead the elections resulted in a hung parliament divided into ideologically opposed factions deeply at odds with one another and unwilling to work together. </p><p>This has made it difficult for any prime minister to garner the necessary support to pass any bills.</p><p>Michel Barnier was appointed prime minister last September but was ousted within three months. </p><p>The government of his successor François Bayrou's too was voted down after nine months after parliament refused to back his austerity budget, which aimed to slash government spending by €44bn ($51bn; £38bn). </p><p>France's deficit reached 5.8% of its GDP in 2024 and its national debt is 114% of its GDP. That is the third highest public debt in the eurozone after Greece and Italy, and equivalent to almost €50,000 per French citizen.</p><p>Stocks fell sharply on the Paris exchange after the news of Lecornu's resignation broke on Monday morning.</p></div>",

It is thought 48 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.</p><p>Trump said over the weekend the hostages could be released \"very soon\", while Netanyahu said they could be freed before the end of the Jewish holiday Sukkot - or October 13th.</p><p>Hamas has agreed to the hostage \"exchange formula\" detailed in Trump's plan, providing certain \"field conditions\" are met.</p><p>But the hostages are the group's only bargaining chip - and it's unclear whether it would be willing to release them before other elements of the deal are finalised.</p><p>Trust between the two sides is virtually non-existent. Only last month, Israel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zepgp5neo\">attempted to assassinate Hamas's negotiating team</a> with an air strike on Doha - angering not only Hamas but also Donald Trump and Qatar, a key mediator.</p><p>Members of that same negotiating team - headed by Khalil al-Hayya, whose son was killed in the strike - will now be meeting just a stone's throw from Israel's delegation in Egypt.</p></div><p></p><h2>Hamas disarmament</h2><p></p><div><p>Israel's stated goal throughout the war has been the destruction of Hamas. Netanyahu has repeatedly stated he will not stop until the group is finished. </p><p>A key point in Trump's plan requires the group to disarm. But Hamas has previously refused to lay down its weapons, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state has been established.</p><p>In its response, Hamas made no mention of disarmament - fuelling speculation that it has not changed its position.</p><p>Over the weekend, Netanyahu vowed: \"Hamas will be disarmed and Gaza will be demilitarised – either the easy way or the hard way\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Future governance of Gaza</h2><p></p><div><p>The plan states that Hamas will have no future role in Gaza, which will be governed by a temporary transitional body of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\" headed and chaired by Donald Trump and involving former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p>Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority (PA).</p><p>Though Netanyahu agreed to all of Trump's 20-point plan, he appeared to push back on involvement of the PA even as he stood on the podium next to the president last week, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jq63edv21o\">insisting it would play no role</a> in governing the territory.</p><p>This is one of many points in the plan that will be objectionable to ultranationalist hardliners within Netanyahu's governing coalition - many of whom want to retain control of Gaza and reconstruct Jewish settlements there.</p><p>In Hamas's response, it indicated that it expects to have some future role in Gaza as part of \"a unified Palestinian movement\". Though the wording is vague, this will likely be unacceptable to both Trump and the Israelis.</p></div><p></p><h2>Israeli withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>The extent of Israel's military withdrawal is a fourth point of contention.</p><p>The plan states that Israel's military will withdraw from Gaza \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes\" that must be agreed by all parties.</p><p>A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">map distributed by the White House</a> showed three proposed stages of Israeli troop withdrawal. The first stage leaves about 55% of Gaza under Israeli control, the second 40%, and the final 15%.</p><p>That final stage would be a \"security perimeter\" that would \"remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat\".</p><p>The wording here is vague and gives no clear timeline for full Israeli withdrawal - something Hamas are likely to want clarity on.</p><p>Additionally, the map shared by the White House doesn't match up with the Israeli military's own maps showing militarised areas, and Gaza's borders are incorrectly drawn in places.</p></div><div><p><span> More on this story</span></p></div></article>",

It warned that there may still be delays on Monday.</p><p>The \"airspace violations\" come at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c708dzqvz1vo\">a time of heightened tension in Europe</a> after a number of drone incursions, suspected of being linked to Russia, caused air traffic disruption.</p></div><div><p>Moscow has denied any involvement in the recent incidents.</p><p>Up to 14 of the weather balloons launched over the weekend floated over the Vilnius area, home to Lithuania's capital and close to the border with Belarus, Lithuanian officials said.</p><p>At least 11 balloons carrying 18,000 packs of black-market cigarettes have since been recovered, though this number could rise, Lithuania's State Border Guard Service said.</p><p>Despite the disruption they caused, a NCMC spokesman said: \"Balloons with contraband cargo - cigarettes from Belarus - are nothing new in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland.\"</p><p>So far this year, 544 balloons have been recorded entering Lithuania from Belarus, he said, while 966 were last year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the north-eastern Podlaskie region of Poland, which also borders Belarus, has recorded more than 100 cases in which contraband was flown in from its neighbour using the balloons, which are typically used to carry weather instruments to high altitudes.</p><p>In one instance last month, Polish police detained a Belarusian citizen whose car had been circling cigarettes smuggled in using a balloon. A geolocation tag was reportedly found on his phone linked to the illicit goods.  </p><p>Asked why criminals use a method that is highly susceptible to the weather, rather than much more controllable drones, the NCMC spokesman said: \"Meteorological balloons are a rudimentary tool used by smugglers - they are cheaper than drones for transporting cigarettes from Belarus.\"</p><p>He added: \"Our services' aim is to seize the largest possible quantities of contraband and to detain organisers and perpetrators so that this activity is unprofitable and does not pose a risk to civil aviation.\"</p><p>Drones of unclear origin caused the closure of Danish airports and airspace in September. Drones were also seen over neighbouring Norway and Germany, prompting European leaders to accelerate discussions about strengthening air defences.</p><p>Denmark said at the time there was no evidence to suggest Russian involvement, despite Moscow being blamed for earlier airspace incursions into Poland, Estonia and Romania. </p><p>Russia either denied these earlier incursions or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7401vk4lgzo\">said they were accidental</a> as its full-scale invasion of nearby Ukraine continues.</p></div>",

Hundreds of local villagers and rescue workers have been deployed to clear out snow blocking access to the area, which sits at an altitude of more than 4,900m (16,000ft). </p><p>Rescuers have guided 350 people to safety in the small township of Qudang. Authorities are in contact with all the hikers who are still trapped.</p></div><div><p>Nature photographer Dong Shuchang was among hundreds of tourists who flocked to the area during China's Golden Week holiday. </p><p>He was looking forward to capturing the Himalayan marvel from the Tibetan slopes, when the snowstorm hit just hours after his trek started on Saturday.</p><p>\"The lightning and thunderstorms would not stop. The snowfall was so heavy I could hardly sleep,\" Mr Dong explained.</p><p>His group had reached an altitude of 4,600m before they decided to turn back.  </p><p>\"Our windbreakers and raincoats were no match for the snow. We were all drenched,\" he said, adding that several people in his group of 20 showed signs of hypothermia.</p><p>The 27-year-old had been to the Himalayas more than a dozen times, but said he has \"never experienced weather like this\". </p><p>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet.</p><p>\"Everyone was moving slowly. The route was very slippery. I kept falling because of the ice.\"</p><p>His group spent last night in a hotel room in Qudang, where they relied on a generator for electricity. </p><p>When they left the hotel this morning, the snowstorm had finally subsided.</p><p>\"We're just so relieved to get help and support,\" he said.</p><p>Chen Geshuang, who was part of Mr Dong's hiking group, said the snow was about a metre deep when the group started their retreat on Sunday.</p><p>\"All of us are experienced hikers,\" Ms Chen said. \"But this blizzard was still extremely difficult to deal with. I was so lucky to get out.\"</p><p>\"This year's snow was exceptional,\" the 29-year-old outdoor enthusiast said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ff9/live/d79e9e70-a277-11f0-90f0-a7385d15551b.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images The peaks of Mount Everest covered in snow with a cloudy sky in the background\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>The showstorm hit during Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism in China</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Another woman told the BBC that her husband who had been stuck in the snowstorm was slowly descending from the mountains, but thick snow cover has made his retreat extremely difficult. </p><p>\"Even for rescuers, it's not easy, they need to clear snow to make a path,\" said the woman, who declined to be named.</p><p>\"I hope my husband's team reaches [the rescue team] safely.\"</p><p>Her husband had told her that he barely slept in his tent because he was afraid of being buried in the snow, the woman said.</p><p>Another hiker, Eric Wen, told Reuters that three people in his group suffered from hypothermia even though they were adequately dressed.</p><p>They hardly slept because it was snowing too hard and his group had to clear the snow every 10 minutes. </p><p>\"Otherwise our tents would have collapsed.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e1d/live/b3abd670-a297-11f0-b5fb-09dc1426da0e.png.webp\" alt=\"Dong Shuchang A hiker dressed in a winter coat and carrying a navy backpack trudges through thick snow cover\" /><span>Dong Shuchang</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Mr Dong's escape from the trail was lined with wet snow and falling sleet</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>China is in the middle of its week-long National Day holiday known as Golden Week, a peak season for local tourism.</p><p>October usually provides clear skies and friendly temperatures, making it one of the favoured months to hike in the Mount Everest area. </p><p>Many hikers have made their way to the Karma Valley hiking trail, a lesser-known but scenic route to the base of Everest - which also offers a view of the world's tallest peak.</p><p>Although many people attempt to climb the summit every year, it is considered an incredibly dangerous hike. </p><p>In recent years it has been plagued with concerns of overcrowding, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5539lj1pqo\">environmental concerns</a> and a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65680598\">fatal climbing attempts.</a></p><p>The region is facing extreme weather at the moment. </p><p>Neighbouring Nepal has been battered by torrential rains and floods that has killed at least 47 people, blocked roads, and washed away bridges.</p><p>On the other side of China, Typhoon Matmo has made landfall on the country's eastern coast, forcing about 150,000 people to evacuate from their homes. </p></div></article>",

The Trump administration is expected to quickly appeal the decision. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq044n72po\">US cities should be military training grounds, Trump tells generals</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">Trump authorises deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago</a></li></ul><p>Meanwhile, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said late on Sunday night that Trump was \"ordering 400 members of the Texas National Guard for deployments to Illinois, Oregon, and other locations within the United States\".</p><p>In a statement, the governor called the proposed deployment \"Trump's invasion\", and said there was \"no reason\" to send troops into any state without the \"knowledge, consent, or cooperation\" of local officials.</p><p>He told CNN that the authorisation of troops there would incite protests and accused the administration of creating a \"warzone\" to rationalise the response.</p><p>Pritzker also called on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to \"immediately withdraw any support for this decision and refuse to co-ordinate\".</p><p>In response, Abbott said he \"fully authorized\" Trump's decision to call up the Texas National Guard \"to ensure safety for federal officials\".</p><p>\"You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,\" he said in a statement on X.</p><p>Like Portland, Chicago has seen protests over increased immigration enforcement. On Saturday, protests became violent, with immigration authorities saying they opened fire on an armed woman after she and others allegedly rammed their cars into law enforcement vehicles. </p><p>The woman's condition is unclear, but officials said she drove herself to hospital. </p><p>Protests have been ongoing in Portland and other cities over the Trump administration's increased immigration enforcement. </p><p>Portland, in particular, has long drawn Trump's ire over its alleged concentration of people his supporters describe as Antifa, short for \"anti-fascist\". The president recently signed an executive order designating the group, which is a loosely organised movement of far-left activists, as a domestic terrorist organisation.</p><p>The Portland deployment came one day after Trump authorised the deployment of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dnk0ee6pyo\">300 National Guard troops to Chicago</a> under a similar pretext.</p><p>The National Guard is the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force. The state-based military force can be called up by either a state governor or the US president. It is often deployed to provide disaster relief after floods and hurricanes but can also support military operations overseas.</p><p>Over the summer, Trump directed National Guard troops to be deployed in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, saying they were needed to quell crime or protests. These were significant decisions, as deployments are typically left to a state's governor. </p><p>Trump has sought to use National Guard troops in a number of US cities to crack down on crime and support immigration enforcement - including in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles, California. </p><p>In September, a federal judge in California ruled Trump's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles was illegal because it violated an act that limits the power of the federal government to use military force for domestic matters.</p><p>The administration is appealing that decision. </p></div><p>Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

One partner is more into fashion and always makes an effort to present well, while the other \"doesn't care about how they look\".</p><p>This can have wider implications for a couple beyond just looking mismatched in public, Ifesinachi says. Perhaps the person who makes less effort with their appearance \"doesn't care about what restaurant they're going to or what kind of dates they plan\", she says.</p><p>Dating coach Vicki Pavitt suggests swag gaps might lead to conflicts as partners want to feel \"proud standing beside each other\". If one isn't putting as much effort in, \"it can feel like they're disrespecting the relationship\", she says.</p><p>But it could just be that they're simply not as fashion-conscious - despite their best intentions.</p><p>Relationship psychologist Anjula Mutanda says: \"Your partner may have made a lot of effort, but in your mind, they don't quite stack up to your high standard.\"</p><p>If the more stylish partner sees themselves as superior because of the way they look, and \"weaponises\" their sense of style, this could lead to an unhealthy power dynamic, she continues.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dddb/live/44c8fb30-a052-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"XNY/Star Max/GC Images Benny Blanco (L) and Selena Gomez are seen on March 20, 2025 in New York City. \" /><span>XNY/Star Max/GC Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Newly-weds Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are often described as having a swag gap</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>And trying to influence the way your partner dresses - buying them clothes, telling them their outfit doesn't work, or suggesting a wardrobe clear-out - is fraught with risk.</p><p>\"You want your partner to be a reflection of you in some way,\" says Vicki. \"I think that's really natural.\"</p><p>But trying to mould someone's appearance according to your preferences is dangerous, she argues, as the person on the receiving end could see it as an unwelcome imposition.</p><p>Instead, you should be \"uplifting and encouraging\", says relationships coach Persia Lawson.

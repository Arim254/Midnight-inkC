    "body": "6 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianandAlys DaviesGrowing unrest in Iran is reported to have claimed more lives on a fifth day of protests over the soaring cost of living.Both the semi-official Fars news agency and human rights group, Hengaw, said two people had died during clashes between protesters and security forces in the city of Lordegan, in south-western Iran. Three more people were killed in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, Fars reported, all in the west of the country.On Thursday videos posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces. Many protesters have called for ending the rule of the country's supreme leader. Some have also called for a return to the monarchy.As the day wore on more reports came in of unrest up and down the country, on the fifth day of the protests, sparked by a currency collapse.Videos verified by BBC Persian show protests in the central city of Lordegan, the capital Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province taking place on Thursday.Fars reported that in Lordegan two people were killed, citing an informed official. The report did not specify whether those killed were protesters or members of the security forces. It also reported the three deaths in Azna, in neighbouring Lorestan province, without specifying if there were protesters or security officials. Rights group Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday night in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "'National treasure' Brighton pier put up for sale2 hours agoPeter Whittlesea,Danny Pike,in BrightonandPatrick Barlow,South EastDanny Pike / BBCAnne Ackord, Brighton Pier Group's chief executive, said looking to sell the pier had been a \"difficult decision\"Brighton's Palace Pier has been put up for sale with suggestions new owners could be found by the summer, its chief executive says.The Brighton Pier Group will put the 126-year-old Grade II* Listed pier on the market for an undisclosed price, saying the decision was made to return the best value for money for shareholders.The decision follows warnings of \"difficult\" trading for the pier in previous years which have been linked to a decline in tourism in Brighton and poor summer weather.Anne Ackord, the group's CEO, said: \"The pier is an integral part of Brighton and I know the local council and residents appreciate that.\"Ms Ackord added: \"Of course there is an element of sadness. It has been a difficult decision but we have shareholders and we have decided that our duty is to them.\"It's not just a national treasure but a Brighton treasure as well. You are buying a piece of history.\"Ms Ackord said any prospective buyer \"would want to be in situ by the summer\", suggesting a sale could be completed before the pier's busiest trading period.She added that, while the group was not publicly stating a price for the pier, those wishing to buy it would need \"many millions\".ReutersBrighton Palace Pier has been put up for sale, its owners sayBrighton Palace Pier opened in May 1899 after three years of construction, and the Brighton Pier Group bought the structure in 2016 for £18m.Brighton Pier Group previously said that 2023 and 2024 had been \"difficult\" years for the pier, blaming a decline in tourism in Brighton.In March 2025 Ms Ackord warned of a \"very difficult trading situation over the last few years, wherein costs have risen overall by about 50%\".And in November it warned that it was considering selling the 1,772ft (540m) long structure.The pier's like-for-like sales dropped by 4% in 2024, compared with 2023.An admission fee of £1 for non-residents was introduced in 2024 and doubled to £2 in March, and this \"partially alleviated\" lost revenue from the pier, a report filed in Companies House said.Brighton Pier Group also previously said it was actively marketing Lightwater Valley, its theme park in Ripon, North Yorkshire, for £3m in October.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "16 hours agoSilvia CosteloeCrans-MontanaWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireThere is sheer disbelief on people's faces here, confronted by this tragedy - they just can't believe it.I've been coming to Crans-Montana all my life, and this is a wonderful ski resort that just keeps getting bigger and bigger.There's a lot of building going on all the time. It's a place where there's a lot of money and a lot of great skiing. It's very family friendly and there are lots of children.In the summer they've got golf, in the winter they've got skiing, there are mountain bike trails. It's a really popular destination year round, quite a high-end market, and not the kind of place where you would expect a fire to engulf a bar.Le Constellation is somewhere I used to go to when I was much younger. It's a really classic bar.It's very big and right smack in the centre of Crans just by the cinema, and somewhere a lot of locals as well as tourists would be hanging out.This is a bar where lots of young people went. There will be people who are unsure if those they knew were out there, who are trying to trace them.Earlier today, I was speaking to a woman who asked: \"What is happening in the world if you can't go to a bar now in Crans-Montana?\" A British tourist told me he'd heard all these ambulances and just thought people had taken the drinking too far.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fire'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeWhat we know so far about how the fire broke outBut, of course, what it actually involved is this horrible tragedy.It's hard to imagine that something like that would happen here, in a place where there's money, very good levels of health and safety, great infrastructure and where police arrived at the scene pretty much immediately.ReutersPeople leave flowers outside Le ConstellationThis morning I woke up to go skiing, but when I saw what had happened I came to the scene instead.The cordoned off area is usually the beating heart of Crans. Initially it was incredibly quiet. I got there before they had erected this huge wall outside the bar. In the early hours of New Year's Day, people were sleeping off their hangovers and their partying, so the police presence gave the scene an almost eerie quality.Now more and more media tripods are going up. People started waking up - some had their skis on - and they all just came up against the cordon and asked what was going on. Some people had not heard yet.Increasingly however small huddles of people are talking about it. Some people have been sharing their stories of a really tragic and horrific night - how they saw people with severe burns, and how they escaped the burning bar by smashing a window.Others are looking in total disbelief at the police cordon in this very well-to-do Swiss Alpine resort. The size of the cordon, the amount of disruption and the number of closed roads all indicate a major disaster.It's just completely shocking.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMost of Friday's papers lead with the fire at a Swiss ski resort bar which has killed dozens of people. \"Horror on the dancefloor\" is the headline for the Daily Star, which reports that British people are \"feared to be among the dead\" following the incident in Crans-Montana in south-west Switzerland.  More than 100 other people are injured, many of them critically, following the \"horror movie\" inferno at the New Year's Eve party in Le Constellation bar, the Daily Express reports. Witnesses tell the paper that the fire could have been started by candles or sparklers.The sparklers that caused the fire were attached to champagne bottles, according to the Sun's lead. Families face an \"unbearable wait\" of days for the bodies of victims to be identified. The fire is \"one of the worst tragedies\" that Switzerland has ever faced, according to the country's president. The i Paper reports that neighbouring countries are offering to \"lend support\" in treating patients, after local hospitals were overwhelmed with victims.The Daily Mail reports that the Foreign Office is on standby to assist any British nationals caught up in the tragedy, after Swiss officials confirmed international citizens were among the dead. Separately, the paper is one of several to feature a photo of the host of The Traitors, Claudia Winkelman, which returned to screens last night with a shake-up of the usual format.Switzerland will hold five days of mourning following the inferno, the Guardian reports, after the country's president vowed to ensure an incident of this kind never happens again. The King and Queen have offered their condolences to the victims of the fire, according to the Times, with the King also praising \"heroic first responders and selfless emergency services\". The paper notes that eight French nationals and sixteen Italian nationals are missing. \"New Year horror inferno\" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which also features a photo of waitresses carrying champagne bottles with sparklers through Le Constellation bar. The Daily Telegraph front page features a photo of the moment the blaze began spreading across the ceiling of the bar's basement. It adds that the fire likely \"triggered the release of combustible gases that ignited violently\".Finally, the fire in Switzerland features on the front page of the Financial Times, but the paper leads on plans by three US tech giants to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) \"as early as this year\". IPO preparations for SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic are \"raising hopes of record returns for their investors and advisers\", the paper writes. Friday's papers are dominated by the Swiss ski resort fire. \"From joy to horror in seconds\" is how the Guardian describes what happened in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve. The Financial Times reports that police and firefighters \"rushed to the scene\" after smoke was seen at about 01:30 local times. According to the Daily Mail, a sparkler in a champagne bottle is believed to have caused what the paper describes as an \"inferno\". The Daily Telegraph features claims from local workers and residents that the situation was made \"even worse\" because the sparkler set off a gas leak.The Daily Star reports that partygoers \"clambered through choking smoke and flames\" to reach a staircase leading to the exit of the Le Constellation bar. Survivors who escaped are quoted in the Daily Express describing what happened as like \"scenes from a horror film\". A 19-year-old student from Geneva recounts in the Mail how people were \"shirtless, disfigured, burned\". The paper says some of his \"haunting descriptions\" were \"too graphic to publish\".As the day wore on, the Times says, \"frantic\" parents were posting messages on social media appealing for information about their children. The Sun suggests British people might be \"among those who perished\". The Mail says families face an \"agonising wait\" for news because as the Times reports, identification of the victims \"could take days\" of DNA and dental tests because some of the bodies were so badly burnt.The Daily Telegraph's coverage features business owners criticising the lack of health and safety regulations in Crans-Montana. \"People do what they want\", is how one man describes the situation. The Guardian includes the Swiss president's defiant message in response to the tragedy. Guy Parmelin says the country owes to the young people who had their \"projects, hopes and dreams\" cut short to ensure nothing similar ever happens again.Related Internet Links",

Yellow snow and ice warnings are already in place elsewhere.Up to 40cm of snow could hit parts of Scotland, while the Met Office predicts as much as 5cm in areas across England and Wales.Delays and cancellations to rail and air travel, disruption on the roads and power cuts are all expected as a result of the wintry conditions, the weather service added.Yellow warnings for snow and ice came into force for large parts of England, Northern Ireland and Wales at midnight on Thursday, remaining until midday on Friday in England and Wales, and 10:00 GMT in Northern Ireland.  The amber warnings in Scotland are currently due to be in effect until midday on Saturday. Areas which will likely be affected by \"blizzard conditions\" include, Angus, Perth and Kinross, Grampian, Aberdeenshire, Moray and parts of the Highlands.Cold Arctic air is blowing across the UK, forcing temperatures well below average and increasing the risk of ice and snow showers. Met Office forecaster Neil Armstrong predicts the cold spell \"could last well into next week \" and \"wintry hazards will continue with more weather warnings likely\".People are being urged to plan routes carefully and to pack essentials in your car in the event of delays. Key items to bring include warm clothing, water, a blanket and ice-scraper.With lower temperatures, amber cold health alerts from the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cover the whole of England.The alerts warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people.Other consequences of cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, according to the UKHSA.Stay up to date with the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website or app as details are likely to change.",

    "body": "22 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterGetty ImagesPeople buying cryptocurrency in the UK now need to share their account details or face penalties, in changes that came into effect on 1 January. The move by the UK's tax body is designed to ensure they pay all relevant tax on buying and selling crypto, including capital gains tax.HMRC will begin automatically collecting information on all users of cryptocurrency exchanges - which are effectively the industry's banks - in a bid to start collecting tens of millions in unpaid tax.The change comes as the financial watchdog continues its consultation on tougher regulation for the industry, including measures to stop insider trading.The value of Bitcoin, which is often seen as a barometer of the entire industry, surged from about $93,500 (£69,500) a coin at the start of 2025 to a high of nearly $124,500 before falling below $90,000 by the end of the year.Investors who bought when the value was lower and sold when it was higher are in line to pay taxes, but authorities have historically struggled to collect it, says Dawn Register, a tax dispute resolution partner at accountancy firm BDO. \"HMRC has been concerned for some time about high levels of non-compliance among crypto investors,\" she says.The new rules coming in will make it much harder for the crypto rich to hide any untaxed gains, giving the tax authorities much more information about crypto users and their transactions.Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act like banks for the industry allowing people to exchange standard currency for virtual coins, must now ensure they automatically share up to date and accurate accounts of all their users' earnings. If not, fines may be imposed. These Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF) regulations are being implemented in dozens of other countries  which will make international cooperation easier for tax authorities to share information.HMRC estimates there could be many thousands of crypto owners in the UK with unpaid tax bills and hope the new rules will bring in at least £300m in the next five years.Ms Register warns that anyone who made crypto gains in the 2024-25 financial year may have to file a tax return before 31 January, through a new dedicated section in the self-assessment form.\"HMRC is also looking to encourage voluntary disclosure where people have unpaid tax in earlier years and want to correct their affairs,\" she says.\"HMRC is running a disclosure facility where taxpayers can come clean on undeclared gains and unpaid tax prior to April 2024.\"Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority is running public consultation until 12 February on other proposed crypto rules, which include standards for crypto exchanges, new requirements to ensure brokers act responsibly, and rules around crypto lending and borrowing.Commenting on the consultation last month, the authority's executive director for payments and digital finance David Geale said regulation was coming.\"Our goal is to have a regime that protects consumers, supports innovation and promotes trust. We welcome feedback to help us finalise these rules,\" he said.With additional reporting from Joe Tidy",

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is among some 60 female lawmakers petitioning for more women's toilets in the parliament building to match their growing representation in the legislature.A record 73 women were elected into the 465-seat Lower House in October 2024, exceeding the previous high of 54 in 2009.One opposition lawmaker, Yasuko Komiyama, said there were often \"long queues in front of the restroom... before plenary sessions start\", and quoted another MP who said she had \"given up\" going to the toilet before a session began. There is one female toilet with two cubicles near the plenary chamber, though the entire building itself has nine female toilets with 22 cubicles.There are a total of 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and urinals across the building, according to local media reports. The current situation is \"often inconvenient\" because female staff and visitors also share the toilets, said Ms Komiyama from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party.\"I want to raise my voice and prepare myself for the day when women hold more than 30% of [parliamentary seats] in the future,\" she wrote in a post on Facebook.Japan's parliament building was built in 1936, a decade before women were given the right to vote in 1945. The first women were appointed to parliament in 1946.The parliament building is a sprawling three-storey structure, with a central portion that is nine storeys high. The building occupies 13,356 square metres (143,800 sq ft), the equivalent of about two football pitches, with a total floor area of 53,464 square metres.\"If the administration is serious about promoting women's empowerment, I believe we can count on their understanding and cooperation,\" Komiyama said, according to Japanese media.Chair of the Lower House committee Yasukazu Hamada has \"expressed a willingness\" to consider the proposal for more women's toilets, said an Asahi Shimbun report. The Japanese government earlier set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade.Women currently hold nearly 16% of the seats in the Lower House and about a third – or 42 out of 125 seats – in the Upper House.Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader in October last year, had pledged to raise female representation in her cabinet to levels comparable to Nordic countries, which hold the top spots in terms of female leadership.But she has appointed just two other women to her 19-member cabinet.In Japan, the dearth of women's restrooms extends beyond the legislative chamber.Long lines in front of women's public restrooms are a common sight nationwide. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had said his government would look into \"enhancing women's restroom facilities\" to make Japan a society where \"women can live their lives with peace of mind\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

He also evaded a question about a statement by President Donald Trump that the US had hit a docking facility in Venezuela - the first such attack inside the country reportedly carried out by the CIA. US forces have been hitting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" , with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.The latest attack came on Wednesday when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.On Monday, Trump said the US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.The US has also been cracking down on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterEastEnders and James Bond actor Colin Salmon has said he is \"genuinely grateful\" for the \"compassion\" he was shown by a court after he avoided a driving ban for speeding.The actor plays George Knight in the BBC One soap and also appeared in three Bond films from the Pierce Brosnan era - Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.Salmon already had nine points on his licence and received three more for travelling at 24mph in a 20mph zone in London last March.That would usually trigger an automatic six-month disqualification from driving, but Salmon avoided a ban, partly because he cares for his seriously ill wife and daughter and drives them to medical appointments. Writing on X on Thursday, Salmon apologised and said he appreciated the understanding shown for his \"extraordinary circumstances\".\"I hold my hands up, take full responsibility & apologise,\" he wrote. \"I actually feel the 20mph limit has improved quality of life in London.\"Nine points in seven weeks within half a mile of my front door. Proves the maxim 'you're more likely to have an accident five mins from home!'\"The court weighed up our extraordinary circumstances, fined me but showed compassion for which I'm genuinely grateful.\"He added: \"Here's to a less eventful and healthy 2026.\"Salmon, 64, appeared at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court in south-west London earlier this week.He pleaded guilty to driving his Suzuki Wagon in excess of the 20mph limit in  Acton, near his Shepherds Bush home, on 31 March last year.The actor already had nine points for speeding in April 2023, running a red light in February 2025, and driving without due care and attention in April 2025.On Tuesday, Salmon was fined £666, with £130 costs, ordered to pay a £266 victim surcharge and received three more penalty points, but avoided a driving ban.Salmon is married to artist and illustrator Fiona Hawthorne, who previously revealed she was diagnosed with a rare lung condition, interstitial lung disease, which requires her to use an oxygen tank. She underwent a lung transplant in the US in 2024.The couple's daughter Sasha also fell ill with lymphoma, a cancer that affects the blood cells, in 2019.They also have a high-functioning autistic son, and Salmon himself underwent hip replacement surgery last year.Bench chairman Mark Stollery told him: \"We note you are the main breadwinner and carer for your family and within the family, members have life-limiting conditions, including your wife and children.\"The magistrate noted Salmon and his family would suffer \"exceptional hardship\" if he was disqualified, adding: \"They rely on you abnormally compared to most families and we also note your charitable work and that takes up time and travel.\"Salmon previously said he took the role in EastEnders in 2022 as he \"can't be far from home\" because his wife is \"not well\".His character in the soap, ex-boxer George Knight, is the patriarch of the Knight family and a former co-owner of the Queen Vic pub.In James Bond, Salmon played MI6 deputy chief of staff Charles Robinson, and was often featured in scenes along side Dame Judi Dench's M.Salmon's other screen credits include Death In Paradise, Silent Witness, Band of Gold, Judge John Deed, Bad Girls, Doctor Who, Spooks and Midsomer Murders.",

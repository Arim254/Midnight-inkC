    "body": "4 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporterandPaul Seddon,political reporterReutersLord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador in Washington in December 2024Documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US are due to be released, following pressure from MPs.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has acknowledged the vetting process included discussion of Lord Mandelson's continued relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted.However, he has accused Lord Mandelson of lying throughout the process and misrepresenting the extent of their relationship.The BBC understands Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.It was essentially a two-stage process: an initial due diligence check prior to his appointment, followed by security vetting. So how did it work? Due diligenceThe due diligence check was carried out by a team at the Cabinet Office on behalf of Downing Street, as the prime minister was responsible for the appointment.The point of this check is to identify reputational risks or potential conflicts of interests that may need to be considered during the hiring process. Sir Chris Wormald, the UK's top civil servant, has previously confirmed to MPs that this was largely based on public information, such as media reports.At the time, it was public knowledge that the peer had maintained his relationship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The only non-public information that featured, Sir Chris added, were records of a meeting Lord Mandelson facilitated between Epstein and Sir Tony Blair that have since been disclosed by the National Archives.Lord Mandelson's file included information about his previous roles inside and outside government, and his \"professional and financial relationships\".His prior relationship with Epstein was listed as a reputational risk, Sir Chris added, alongside his previous two resignations as a minister during the last Labour government. Follow-up questionsAfter reviewing the file, No 10 sources said Sir Keir asked Lord Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed?At the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed to the role, meaning he then underwent security vetting. No 10 will no doubt face pressure to release them as part of the disclosure process approved by MPs.Security vettingIn addition to providing information about his private interests, Lord Mandelson would have undergone security vetting before taking up the role.The Foreign Office, which is responsible for Britain's overseas embassies, says all ambassadors are required to go through developed vetting (DV), the most intrusive process required to access the most secret government information.Security vetting is carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV), a specialist agency within the Cabinet Office.The process is designed to make sure those being vetted are unlikely to abuse their access to secret material, or be subject to blackmail or bribery.According to government guidance, those undergoing DV are required to fill out various questionnaires including information about their personal finances, internet use, medical conditions, and email addresses they hold.Several checks are carried out, including on candidates' credit history and to check if they have any criminal records. Those being vetted also have to undertake an interview with a specially trained vetting officer, which can cover areas including candidates' health, friendships, family and sexual history. The UKSV decides whether or not to award security clearance, and can attach mitigations, such as being prevented from seeing certain information.The results of this vetting are kept within a tight circle and only the vetting agency and the security team can see the contents. Ministers, including the prime minister, never see the details.Ultimately, Lord Mandelson was announced as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024.However, after less than a year in the role, he was sacked last September following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.The government said the depth of their relationship was not known when he was appointed.However, the PM is now facing questions over whether the information in the public domain was enough to raise alarm bells.

    "body": "6 hours agoErica WitheringtonDisability affairs reporterBBCAlton Towers will not allow some people with conditions like autism, ADHD and anxiety to use their disability queuing system this February half-term.Merlin Entertainments provides a ride access pass to help visitors to its theme parks who have a difficulty queuing because of their disability or medical needs.They say the number of people requesting the pass has been increasing, adding that disabled visitors have said the system \"simply isn't working for them\" and that \"queue times for these guests have increased\".A new restriction will also apply at Chessington World of Adventures and Windsor Legoland, as part of a trial to reduce the number of people who get access to the pass.Neurodiverse people can become overwhelmed or distressed when surrounded by large numbers of people, which can bring on sensory overload or panic attacks.Up until now, people who have a \"difficulty with crowds\" have qualified for the ride access pass, but only those with \"difficulty standing,\" \"level access\" or \"urgent toilet needs\" will do so during the half-term trial. Others will have to queue as normal.Merlin says it offers support to people with difficulty with crowds through \"a range of reasonable adjustments\".'No one likes queuing'Henry Shelford, chief executive of the ADHD UK charity, said \"a group of people will be excluded because of this lack of accommodation\".\"It's different from a child just not being happy about it, because no one likes queuing,\" he said.\"When a kid has ADHD, their energy and their focus makes [queuing] just impossible.\"As an adult with ADHD, I can tell you there's a whole lot of stuff I haven't done because I can't face the queuing.\"I have a need to move all the time, and being penned in in that way is very difficult for me as an adult. And it's near impossible for children and others.\"All visitors to Alton Towers can opt to purchase a \"Fastrack\" pass to skip the queues, but these start at an extra £35 on top of the ticket price. The change follows an update by the disability access card provider Nimbus, which is recognised by many attractions and events.Nimbus has split its former \"standing and queuing\" card section into two separate symbols: \"difficulty standing\" (a physical need) and \"difficulty with crowds\" (often linked to neurodivergence or anxiety).During half‑term, Merlin says new eligibility for the ride access pass is being trialled. Those whose Nimbus card shows only the \"difficulty with crowds\" icon will be asked to visit guest services for personalised support instead. The approach will be reviewed after February before the theme park opens fully in March.Jonathan and Cheryl Willis contacted BBC Your Voice when they heard about the changes to the ride access pass for half-term.They had tickets to go with their son Joshua, who has autism, but say there is no way he will be able to join the main queues.\"It's his special place,\" Cheryl said. \"He has a special interest in rollercoasters - he's going to be absolutely devastated if he can't go.\"Jonathan WillisJonathan and Cheryl Willis say Alton Towers is their son Joshua's \"special place\"Five-year-old Joshua also has mobility issues, but after the changes to the Nimbus card scheme, his parents said he had only been allocated the \"difficulty with crowds\" icon on his card.Cheryl said not being able to take her son to Alton Towers would be particularly difficult as he is not currently in nursery or school, and otherwise struggles to leave the house.\"He's learning to be out and about in the world,\" she said. \"They don't understand how massive a problem this is causing to people like us.\"Rob Smith, chief operating officer at Merlin Entertainments, said growing demand had led to issues for people using the passes, but recognised the suggested eligibility changes had \"raised concerns for some guests\".\"Our commitment to supporting neurodiverse guests and those with mental health needs remains,\" he said. \"We are listening carefully to this feedback and are committed to keeping this approach under review ahead of our main season openings in March.\"We remain deeply committed to creating inclusive experiences and ensuring all guests feel supported when visiting our attractions.\"",

Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire at about 15:20 GMT on Thursday. Supt Chris Neve said they were responding to reports of the assault of a teacher by a pupil brandishing a weapon.\"The teacher's injury is not a stab injury. A lockdown was implemented but has now been lifted,\" he said. Wales First Minister Eluned Morgan said \"violence of any kind has no place in our schools\". \"All pupils at the location are safe and most have gone home,\" said Supt Neve, adding that the teacher is receiving medical treatment for their injuries. He added that officers remained at the school, and that the 15-year-old boy was in police custody. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said they were called to the scene and one patient was transported to hospital.Pembrokeshire council said most pupils had now left the school and confirmed police officers remained on site.\"Any planned after-school events have been cancelled this evening,\" a spokesperson said.Morgan, who visited the school last week, said her thoughts were with the injured teacher, their family and the entire school community, adding her government would support all those affected.Mid and South Pembrokeshire MP Henry Tufnell said he was \"very grateful to the school staff and our emergency services for their swift response in ensuring the safety of pupils and colleagues\".He described the local area as a \"really close community\".More top stories",

    "body": "Man guilty of murdering girl, 9, playing in street3 hours agoJessica LaneandEleanor Maslin,East Yorkshire and LincolnshireLina SavickeDeividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte outside the shop where her mother worked in 2022A man has been found guilty of murdering a nine-year-old girl as she played in the street.Deividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte in a random attack outside the shop where her mother worked in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 28 July 2022.The 26-year-old admitted killing Lilia but denied her murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental state. However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following a trial.Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on 25 February. Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court on 25 FebruaryLilia had been playing with a hula hoop with a friend outside her mother's shop on Fountain Lane.Shortly after 18:20 BST, the pair were approached by Skebas who reached out and stabbed Lilia once in the chest.The 'heinous' child killing that shook a town and the fight for justiceHer mother, Lina Savicke, remembers hearing Lilia call her name before she rushed into the street to see her daughter still clutching the hoop and, moments later, collapsing into her arms.The court heard that, despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being stabbed. Skebas, who had no connection to Lilia, was arrested at his home two days after the attack, and the paring knife he had recently bought from a local shop was found behind a radiator.He was found unfit to stand trial in the months after the stabbing and was later transferred to Rampton high security hospital.In July 2023, a jury found Skebas carried out the act of killing Lilia, and, two years later, following an improvement in his mental health, it was decided he could face a murder trial.During the trial, the jury was told Skebas was assessed by three psychiatrists.All three doctors agreed Skebas had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.But the prosecution rejected Skebas's claim of diminished responsibility and alleged the killing was \"deliberate and planned\". Lina SavickeLilia was a \"beautiful soul with a strong character\", her stepfather Aurelijus Savickas saidProsecutor Christopher Donnellan KC told the court it was a \"wicked act\", adding Skebas knew he was \"killing a child\".The jury found Skebas guilty of Lilia's murder by an 11 to one majority verdict after deliberating for more than seven hours.Skebas appeared on a video link from Rampton Hospital to hear the verdict and did not appear to show any emotion.Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas was arrested in Boston on 30 July 2022, two days after the stabbingHe stared straight ahead as the statement of Lilia's mother, Lina Savicke, was read out.It began by stating Lilia would have turned 13 on Monday this week.\"Over these years of loss, both I and my entire family have lived through so much.\"Tears and pain cannot wash away everything we feel.\"The statement added: \"What parent ever thinks they will have to bury their own child?\" Speaking in court, Aurelijus Savickas, Lilia's stepdad, said: \"I came into her life when she was just three years young. \"From that moment on, we loved our journey together through the good days and the bad.\"I loved her as my own. She was a beautiful soul with a strong character and strong personality.\"Lina SavickeLilia \"loved drawing and painting\" and had a wall in her bedroom where she could paint freely, her stepfather saidAs the family impact statements were read out in court, several people could be seen wiping tears from their faces.The judge Mr Justice Choudhury excused the jury from further jury service for ten years.Addressing them, he said: \"I appreciate it has been a difficult experience for you.\"Det Chief Insp Jennifer Lovett, from Lincolnshire Police, said: \"It's taken us three-and-a-half years to bring Skebas to justice.\"It's not lost on me how difficult that must have been for Lilia's family.\"She added: \"It's been one of our most high-profile investigations that Lincolnshire Police has had.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "30 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterReutersDonald Trump has signalled that he now supports the UK's Chagos Islands handover deal to Mauritius, after launching a scathing attack on the agreement two weeks ago.The US president had labelled the deal an \"act of great stupidity,\" prompting fears he could withdraw his previous support for it.But in a post on his Truth Social website on Thursday, he described Sir Keir Starmer's deal, announced last year, as the \"best he could make\".Downing Street said Sir Keir had discussed the Chagos Islands with Trump earlier on Thursday, adding that the UK and US would \"continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal\".The deal would see the UK transfer sovereignty of the islands whilst leasing back a joint UK-US military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia for an initial 99 years.In his social media post, Trump did not give his explicit endorsement to the deal, but added he had held \"very productive discussions\" with Sir Keir.He wrote: \"I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.\"However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia.\"The US president added that he \"will never allow our presence on a base as important as this to ever be undermined or threatened by fake claims or environmental nonsense\". Warren Stephens, the US's ambassador to the UK, said while the \"ideal\" outcome would be for the UK not to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, it was the \"best deal on the table for successive UK governments\".Echoing the president, Stephens said the US \"retains the right to maintain and to reinforce our security interests on Diego Garcia if needed in the future\".Trump's previous criticism of the deal came during an international row over his threats to take control of Greenland.At the time, Sir Keir accused Trump of making the comments to pressure the UK over Greenland.A draft law to ratify the Chagos Islands deal is making its way through Parliament but has been delayed since the president's outburst.Sir Keir has insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.A Downing Street readout of Thursday's phone call between Sir Keir and Trump said the pair had \"agreed on the importance of the deal to secure the joint UK–US base on Diego Garcia, which remains vital to shared security interests\".The readout added: \"The UK and US will continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal, they agreed.\"The deal has been heavily criticised by the Conservatives and Reform UK, who have called for the agreement to be scrapped.Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, said Trump's statement \"recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal\" about the lease arrangements.\"Keir Starmer and Peter Mandelson's shameful Chagos surrender remains an absolutely terrible deal for Britain,\" Dame Priti said.\"The Conservative Party's view is unchanged,\" she added. \"We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.\"",

They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down.

    "body": "3 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent EPA/ShutterstockGeneral Grynkewich at Nato headquarters in Brussels last monthThe US and Russia have agreed to re-establish high-level dialogue between their armed forces.The announcement came after a meeting of senior US and Russian military officers in Abu Dhabi in the margins of talks about the war in Ukraine.In a statement, US European Command said the renewed dialogue would \"provide consistent military to military contact as the parties work towards a lasting peace\".This marks a significant rapprochement between the world's two largest nuclear powers and comes after President Donald Trump repeatedly voiced his desire to normalise relations between both countries.The announcement also came amid reports the US and Russia were negotiating a deal to extend a nuclear arms reduction treaty due to expire on Thursday.Throughout decades of crisis and confrontation, the US and Russia have often kept channels of communication open between their armed forces.The aim was to avoid misunderstanding and escalation.But those contacts were suspended in 2021 shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Since then there have been flashpoints involving Russian drones and warplanes entering Nato airspace, and US unmanned aircraft over Syria and the Black Sea.The new agreement was reached during talks in the UAE between US General Alexus Grynkewich, America's and Nato's top general in Europe, and senior Russian and Ukrainian military officials.US European Command said: \"Maintaining dialogue between militaries is an important factor in global stability and peace, which can only be achieved through strength, and provides a means for increased transparency and de-escalation. \"This channel will provide a consistent military-to-military contact as the parties continue to work towards a lasting peace.\"The aim, it said, was \"to avoid miscalculation and to provide a means for avoiding unintended escalation by either side\".There has been some contact between the US, Nato and Russia military officers in recent years but this announcement means a regular dialogue between senior commanders will be re-established.Russia said on Thursday it regretted the expiry of the New Start treaty with the US but was still ready to talk. The Kremlin has offered to extend the treaty and its spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would engage in dialogue with the US if it responded positively.On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media: \"Rather than extend \"NEW START\" (A badly negotiated deal by the United States that, aside from everything else, is being grossly violated), we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved, and modernized Treaty that can last long into the future.\"The Axios news service reported that negotiations had been taking place over the past 24 hours in Abu Dhabi and the two countries were closing in on a deal to keep observing key terms of the treaty.Under New Start, agreed in 2010, both sides agreed to deploy no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads on no more than 700 bombers or missiles. The expiry of the treaty would leave both countries for the first time in half a century without any legal framework restraining their nuclear ambitions.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesBrad Karp resigned as chairman of Paul Weiss after files released by the US justice department detailed his relationship with Jeffrey EpsteinBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious US law firm Paul Weiss, has stepped down after emails released in the latest tranche of Jeffrey Epstein files revealed the lawyer's apparent communications with the late convicted sex offender.The documents included dozens of email exchanges seemingly between Karp and Epstein, including correspondence that reportedly shows Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.Appearing in the documents does not imply any wrongdoing, and Paul Weiss has previously said that Karp \"never witnessed or participated in any misconduct\".Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\"The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Scott Barshay, chair of the firm's corporate practice, has been appointed chairman.\"I step into this role with great confidence in Paul Weiss' continued success,\" he said in the Paul Weiss statement, adding that Karp had made \"immense contributions\" over his four decades at the company.Karp, who was appointed chairman in 2008, will remain at the firm and \"continue to focus his full-time attention to client service,\" the firm itself said in the same statement.The latest batch of millions of files relating to Epstein released by the Department of Justice (DOJ) included numerous email exchanges between Karp and Epstein.Correspondence in 2016 appears to show Karp asking Epstein whether he could help his son secure a role on a Woody Allen film production.The documents also appear to show Karp appearing to discuss Epstein's pre-existing plea deal.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named as Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" An analysis of the correspondence by Bloomberg said this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 deal he had struck with prosecutors.Paul Weiss has previously said that it never represented Epstein. Another statement from the company earlier in the week said that while Karp had known Epstein, \"Mr Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct\". The statement added that: \"Mr Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and found dead in his New York jail cell in August of that year awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Karp's resignation comes less than a year after he agreed a deal with US President Donald Trump in which Paul Weiss would provide $40m (£29m) in free legal services for White House initiatives in return for the US president rescinding an executive order against the firm. Other firms also reached similar agreements with the Trump administration.The lawyer, who has also been a fundraiser for the Democratic Party, is one of many rich and powerful figures whose links to Epstein have been detailed in the files released by the DOJ from its investigation into the disgraced financier.More on this story",

    "body": "Quiz enters administration for third time4 hours agoEmma Simpson,Business correspondentandEmer Moreau,Business reporterQUIZQuiz has 40 shops in the UKFashion chain Quiz has entered administration for the third time in six years, with 109 members of staff in Scotland set to lose their jobs.Administrators said the company, which was founded in 1993, had been struggling over the past year, culminating in poorer-than-expected sales over the Christmas period.The chain's 40 stores and seven concessions remain open, but will be holding clearance sales and not accepting refunds. Its online store is now closed.The 109 redundancies will be made across Quiz's head office in Glasgow and distribution centre in Bellshill, Lanarkshire.The chain employs around 565 people, with 40 stores in the UK. It bills itself as catering to 16 to 35-year-old \"fashion forward females\".Interpath, the restructuring advisor managing the chain's administration, said that Quiz concession stands, which operate in New Look and Matalan stores in the UK, are not part of the administration processes.Clothing retailers have struggled in recent years to compete against ultra-fast-fashion brands such as Shein, particularly as consumers shop increasingly online. Alistair McAlinden, joint administrator and head of Interpath in Scotland said: \"With Quiz, the latest retailer to fall into administration, there's no doubt it's been a tough start to 2026 for the UK High Street.\"It's our intention to continue to trade all stores and the concessions in Ireland as a going concern for as long as we can while we assess options for the business.\"Interpath said affected staff would be given support at \"this difficult time\".Quiz's bricks-and-mortar stores are \"immediately\" launching clearance sales. Any products purchased on or after 5 February will not be eligible for returns unless they are faulty.Products purchased online or in a Quiz shop before 5 February can still be exchanged in person, but card or cash refunds will not be given. Customers who have already returned items purchased via the website, but who have yet to receive a refund, will not receive a refund from Quiz. Administrators said customers should contact their card payment provider to seek assistance. Gift cards and credit notes will not be honoured.Quiz listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2017, raising more than £100m.It went into administration in 2020, and again less than a year ago in February 2025.In 2020, the firm announced plans to put 82 of its shops in the UK and Ireland into administration, then bought them back, allowing it to renegotiate rent with its landlords. It cut 93 jobs at the time.In February 2025, Quiz collapsed again, before being immediately bought by Orion, a subsidiary of the company controlled by the Quiz founding family.Orion bought the Quiz brand and 42 shops. Some 200 jobs were lost due to other shops closing.",

    "body": "The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.In January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres.This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.\"Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.Asked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance. \"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"Clearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only \"elastic, body-tight underwear\". Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.Hyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.There have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.In August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.While it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had \"tried to cheat the system\" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.Both athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.The men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin ShoesmithandHolly Phillips,East Yorkshire and LincolnshireLina SavickeLilia Valutyte, nine, was stabbed to death while playing with a hula hoop near her mother's shop in Boston, LincolnshireLilia Valutyte, nine, was playing outside her mother's shop in Boston, Lincolnshire, when she was stabbed in the heart by Deividas Skebas on 28 July 2022. After a jury found him guilty of her murder on Thursday, prosecutors told of their determination to get justice for Lilia.When her mother reached her, Lilia was still clutching the hula hoop she had been playing with when Skebas plunged a knife into her chest. Moments later, the schoolgirl collapsed, dying, into her mother's arms, with Home Office pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton telling the trial at Lincoln Crown Court the knife had \"effectively entered her heart\", causing \"severe and fatal internal bleeding\".In a flash, on that Boston street, as the evening sun faded, a young life ebbed away and her mother Lina Savicke's life was left in tatters. Man guilty of murdering girl, 9, playing in streetThis close-knit, historic market town struggled to comprehend events, and many of its residents will remember the sight of Lilia's tiny white coffin, adorned with butterflies, passing through its streets.Lincolnshire PoliceDeividas Skebas was arrested in Boston two days after the stabbingSkebas, 26, admitted killing Lilia, but denied murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental state, but this was not accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service, and his not guilty plea to murder forced a trial at Lincoln Crown Court.The court was shown CCTV images of the 69 minutes leading up to the stabbing. Skebas was shown repeatedly walking around the town centre.Skebas, who had no connection to Lilia, chose not to give evidence at his trial, depriving Lilia's family of learning - directly from the killer - why she was singled out.Speaking after the jury returned its verdict, Marc Thompson, district Crown prosecutor for Lincolnshire, said the \"sudden and tragic\" death had \"shook the community\".His words echoed those of the Reverend Jane Robertson who, during Lilia's funeral, had told the congregation how the feeling of anger in the town was \"real and valid\".Prosecutors, though mindful of the need to ensure Skebas had a fair trial, were determined to get justice for Lilia and her family.Thompson added: \"The CPS was determined that he would face the full force of justice for the intent behind what he did.\"He admitted it had been a \"lengthy process\" for Lilia's family, as prosecutors sought to convince the jury that Skebas had set out to kill that day.PA MediaLilia's murder left the small Lincolnshire market town of Boston reelingIn his police interview, conducted the day after he was arrested, Skebas told police, \"I would like you to contact Nasa\" and insisted the US space agency could help.Speaking in broken English, the Lithuanian national told them he had been \"brainwashed\" and was being controlled by a microchip given to him in a piece of rice in Norway.Thompson said the Crown Prosecution Service had decided, once Skebas was declared fit, that it was in the public interest to proceed to trial.\"A trial of murder isn't about the act of killing, it's about the intent of the person doing that act - that they intended to kill or cause really serious harm to another,\" he explained.\"Clearly, a heinous crime that was committed in the open street and the Crown Prosecution Service was committed to bringing the defendant to justice.\"Our case has always been that this was an unspeakable but deliberate act, not as a result of a mental abnormality as Mr Skebas had claimed.\"Elizabeth Cook/PA WireSkebas admitted killing Lilia but denied murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental stateThe trial heard Skebas was detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act in 2020 after showing signs of psychosis when he attacked another person with pepper spray.Skebas was discharged from the hospital to his native Lithuania but legally returned to the UK, via Folkstone, on 2 July 2022.He arrived in Boston where he shared a multi-occupancy home in Thorold Street, living in the TV room. One resident told authorities he believed Skebas was on holiday.Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC said it was not clear why Skebas had returned to the UK, but added it may have been for work reasons although there was little evidence of him searching for employment.Forensic psychiatrist Dr Ian Cumming - called by the defence to give evidence - told the court he was \"confident\" Skebas was psychotic.He described him as \"distracted, not focussed, guarded, suspicious and evasive\".Skebas has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the court was told.Lina SavickeLilia was described by her mum as a child who \"loved to dance, travel and try new things\"Speaking to the BBC in 2023, Lina recalled the horror of that summer's evening.\"I just heard 'Mum!', she said.\"I went outside. I saw there was blood and she was with a hula hoop and the hula hoop was bent. I straight away said, 'Lilia what has happened?' I took the hula hoop and she was still standing. She fell into my hands. I started to shout for...\"As she spoke, Lina's face creased and she cupped it in her hands.\"I started to shout for help,\" she sobbed.Mid flow, the tense of her sentences changed from the past to the present, almost as if she was transported back to the moment her life imploded.\"They [emergency crews] take me inside and I realise that she has gone, and they are not rushing or anything,\" she said.Lina SavickeLilia was a former pupil of Boston Pioneers Academy and Carlton Road AcademyReturning to Lilia's family, Thompson added: \"They [Lilia's family] have been forced to wait for Mr Skebas to be fit to take part in the trial and I'd like to pay tribute to their resilience and patience with the process and hope that seeing justice being served will be of some comfort to them. \"Our [CPS] thoughts are with them and to all who feel Lilia's loss so keenly.\"On Monday, Lilia should have turned 13. Skebas will be sentenced at a later date.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief political correspondentPA MediaKeir Starmer was in Hastings to deliver a speech on local regeneration This is a very serious moment for Sir Keir Starmer.Everything the prime minister has said and done today has reflected the fact that he and his team understand the gravity of his situation.It would have felt odd and jarring had Sir Keir simply delivered the speech that he had been planning to deliver this morning about more funding to inspire pride in neighbourhoods.So he didn't. The prime minister instead delivered an apology specifically to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for having \"believed Mandelson's lies\" and appointed him to the UK's top diplomatic posting.Arguably more telling was the moment when, under intense questioning from journalists, Sir Keir conceded that he understood the \"anger and frustration of Labour MPs\".It is Labour MPs who will determine the prime minister's fate and they are more furious than they have ever been during his leadership right now.Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who has been a thorn in Sir Keir's side over welfare cuts, has said she thinks his position as prime minister is \"untenable\" and it is \"inevitable\" that he will have to stand down.She told BBC Radio York: \"I don't believe he's got a choice.\"He kept from the House [of Commons] for several months the fact that he knew of the associations between Peter Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein at the point of appointment.\"This was a \"dishonourable thing to do\" to MPs, as well as Epstein's victims, she added.Another Labour MP, who did not want to be named, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley: \"I have to say, I don't see how he can carry on.\"\"It's been terminal for months,\" added another, \"but the patient has now stopped responding to treatment.\"A Labour minister said: \"The only thing that is certain is that the government is not in control of this and so it could go anywhere.\"Others Matt spoke to were more supportive of the PM, with Rugby MP John Slinger saying: \"Calm heads need to prevail. The PM has done the right thing here.\" Steve Witherden told BBC Wales: \"At the very least, the prime minister's chief of staff, Mr [Morgan] McSweeney, clearly has to answer why he pushed for Mandelson's appointment despite details of his relationship with Epstein being publicly known.\"However, it is telling that for all the off the record anger, few MPs are calling for the prime minister to go in public. The small handful who have so far are MPs who have never much supported his leadership.In fact, there are not even many MPs willing to call publicly for McSweeney to be sacked, something Sir Keir has resisted doing.That suggests that while the prime minister is weaker than ever, a challenge to his leadership is far from imminent.\"Realistically I don't think something can happen until post-Gorton\", one MP said, referring to the Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February. \"And then it might be too close to May,\" when elections are being held in Scotland, Wales and some English local authorities.A former minister said: \"I still think it is very unlikely anybody moves before May. But it is all moving very fast.\" They added: \"I don't see how the PM recovers from the utter lapse in judgment in appointing Mandelson.\"A current minister said: \"He's done. It's just a question of when.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaSir Keir Starmer has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for believing Lord Mandelson's \"lies\" and appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US.The prime minister began a planned speech on funding to improve local communities by addressing the growing anger over how he had dealt with the issue.While he acknowledged it had been publicly known for some time that Lord Mandelson knew Epstein, he said: \"None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.\"However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM's position was \"untenable\", while the Liberal Democrats called for a confidence vote to see if Labour MPs supported him.The prime minister is facing calls from some of his own MPs to stand down. While the handful of backbenchers to do so publicly are frequent critics of the PM, many more have raised concerns privately.Sir Keir's former political director Luke Sullivan said he thought the PM was \"fighting for his premiership\".He told the BBC's Newscast: \"I don't think you can understate how serious the situation and the peril is that the prime minister finds himself in.\"Seeking to defuse the row in a speech earlier, Sir Keir said he regretted appointing Lord Mandelson and would not have done so if he had known what he knows now.Directly addressing Epstein's victims, he said:  \"I am sorry, sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you. Sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointed him and sorry that even now you're forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.\"Sir Keir has promised to release files, which he says will prove Lord Mandelson lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein when he was being vetted for the US ambassador role.The government was forced into a climbdown by Labour backbenchers, after it had planned to withhold some sensitive material. After a Commons vote, the government will pass documents which could damage national security or diplomatic relations to Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), rather than withholding them.The ISC says the government should decide which documents are made public - and which are not.They say this will be done by the cabinet secretary, with an expectation the documents are laid before parliament \"very shortly\".At the time, Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in December 2024, it was public knowledge that he had maintained a friendship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.The PM said Lord Mandelson was asked directly about the nature of his relationship with Epstein before he was appointed as ambassador, whether he had stayed at his home after his conviction and whether he had accepted gifts and hospitality from him.\"The information now available makes clear that the answers he gave were lies,\" he said.\"He portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew.\"And when that became clear and it was not true, I sacked him.\"The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.ReutersLord Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador last SeptemberChallenged after his speech over whether he should stand down as PM, Sir Keir said he understood the \"anger and frustration amongst Labour MPs\" over Lord Mandelson.However, he added: \"I was elected on a mandate in 2024 to change the country for the better... that's what I intend to do.\"Labour MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio York Sir Keir's position was \"untenable\" he had \"no choice\" but to step down.Meanwhile, Paula Barker, who represents Liverpool Wavertree, said the PM \"has shown that his judgement is questionable\".\"I think he has a very long way to build trust and confidence with public and trust and confidence within our party as a whole,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Jonathan Hinder, the MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, said the PM's decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as US ambassador was a \"catastrophic error of political and moral judgement\".He called on Sir Keir to speak to Labour MPs in person and acknowledge this.Sir Keir has also faced calls to sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Lord Mandelson and widely thought to have lobbied for his appointment.Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said the PM had been given \"shoddy\" advice over the appointment.He told the BBC he did not want a new prime minister but called on Sir Keir to \"get a grip\" and for McSweeney to go.Downing Street has insisted the PM has full confidence in his chief of staff.Lord Mandelson was sacked last September, following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.In recent days, more documents released by the US Department of Justice have laid bare the extent of their relationship.They include emails suggesting Epstein made payments worth thousands of pounds to Lord Mandelson and his partner.Police are investigating allegations of misconduct in public office, after other emails in the files suggested Lord Mandelson forwarded on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary during the financial crisis in 2009.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.",

    "body": "6 hours agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned people over travel to Cape Verde after dozens of Britons fell ill with stomach bugs while there.Since 1 October, the agency has identified 118 cases of shigella and 43 of salmonella linked to trips to the West African archipelago.While most people recover within a week, four British people have died within months of contracting stomach bugs while on holiday there.The warning comes ahead of the February half term, when a greater number of British holidaymakers are expected to travel to the popular winter destination.Shigella and salmonella are both bacterial infections that affect the gut and can cause symptoms including diarrhoea, fever and stomach cramps.Though many who are infected make a full recovery, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and people with existing conditions or a weakened immune system can experience severe symptoms and suffer potentially life-threatening complications.The two bacteria are spread through contact with contaminated faeces, either directly through person-to-person transmission or indirectly from unclean food, water or surfaces.People travelling to Cape Verde are advised to:eat food that is freshly prepared, fully cooked and served piping hotdrink bottled or boiled water and avoid ice in drinksuse bottled or boiled water when brushing your teethonly eat fruit you've peeled yourself avoid salads that may not have been washed in clean water\"Taking a few simple precautions against traveller's diarrhoea and food poisoning can make all the difference,\" Dr Gauri Godbole, the UKHSA's deputy director for gastrointestinal infections and food safety, said.\"The best way to avoid gastrointestinal infections, including shigella and salmonella, or passing them to others, is simply by washing your hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water or alcohol gel – particularly after using the toilet, changing nappies, and before eating or preparing food.\"The UKHSA said the majority of shigella cases were among people who had been to the Santa Maria and Boa Vista areas of Cape Verde.Santa Maria is a resort town on Sal Island, while Boa Vista is the cape's most easterly island. The archipelago typically sees temperatures of around 25C in February.Dr Damien Tully, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, previously told the BBC that outbreaks of shigella were \"not unusual, particularly in busy hospitality settings where large numbers of people are eating and sharing facilities\".He said buffet-style catering can increase the risk and be a \"breeding ground\" for bacteria and viruses.Mark Ashley, 55, of Bedfordshire, Elena Walsh, 64, from Birmingham, Karen Pooley, 64, of Gloucestershire, and a 56-year-old man from Watford all died last year after contracting stomach bugs while in Cape Verde.They are four of six Britons who died after holidaying there since January 2023, all of whose families are now making personal injury claims against package holiday firm Tui.Ashley's wife Emma said she had raised concerns over the hygiene standards at the resort she and her husband had stayed at on Sal.Meanwhile, Walsh's son Sean expressed concerns about the hygiene standards at the hotel where they had stayed.Tui has said it was investigating the claims, but declined to comment further while legal proceedings were active.Cape Verde was struck by Hurricane Erin last August, damaging water and sanitation infrastructure. In its wake, the World Health Organization assessed there was a greater risk of disease from contaminated water and carrier insects.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterGettyThe refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament could cost almost £40bn and take 61 years, under proposals presented to MPs and peers.It's one option presented by the team working on the long-delayed restoration of the historic building, which is falling apart and costs £1.5m a week to maintain.The team has also suggested moving MPs and peers out of the Palace of Westminster for up to 24 years from 2032, under a refurbishment plan that could cost as much as £15.6bn.MPs and peers will debate and vote on the plan to develop these two options and the completion of initial works.UK Parliament/David LeveneSewage pumping equipment in the bowels of Parliament dates back to Victorian timesThe more expensive option involves moving only the House of Lords out of the building while works that could take 61 years and cost £39bn are carried out.Parliament's restoration and renewal team said a final decision on a single preferred option needed to be made by mid-2030.In the meantime, the team has proposed initial works capped at £3bn over a seven-year period. This work includes building temporary accommodation to support MPs and peers during future phases, and building a jetty on the River Thames for deliveries.In a report setting out the recommendations, the R&R Client Board - committee set up to deliver the renovation - said \"continuing in the same way is unsustainable\".The report said: \"It will mean increasing safety and operational risks and will lead to an expensive managed decline of the Palace.\"It added that the cost of delaying a decision is estimated at £70m a year.\"A decision is needed now on starting restoration work,\" the R&R Client Board said in a statement.\"Most of the building dates from the Victorian era and some parts are much older. \"Over the decades, its fabric and its services have deteriorated and require substantial repair or replacement. We are beyond the point where putting off these major works is sustainable.\"House of CommonsDamaged stonework in Parliament's medieval Cloister CourtBut Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh, who opposes the full decant option, said the proposals were \"absurd\".\"We should just repair the building like everybody else,\" he told the BBC. \"We can do it in bits.\"We don't have to have a full decant. I don't think the MPs and peers, if they leave the building for 15 years, they'll ever come back.\"As far as the public are concerned, it's a complete and utter waste of money.\"In contrast, the Prospect trade union called for a full decant.\"Successive governments and parliaments have been kicking the can down the road on restoration and renewal of the estate for years,\" general secretary of the union, Mike Clancy said.He added: \"Every report and expert assessment for more than a decade has found that a full decant is the safest and most value- for-money option. \"This is the option which Parliament should back.\"The restoration of Parliament has long been in the pipeline in Westminster. The parliamentary estate - which includes the House of Commons and the Lords - is crumbling and there are concerns about the risk of a catastrophic incident, such as a fire.Parliament says there have been 36 fire incidents, 12 asbestos incidents and 19 stonemasonry incidents since 2016.A parliamentary committee report from a decade ago warned that the Palace of Westminster \"faces an impending crisis which we cannot responsibly ignore\".\"Unless an intensive programme of major remedial work is undertaken soon, it is likely that the building will become uninhabitable,\" it said.No action was taken for years but with falling masonry, lingering asbestos, regular fires and exploding toilets, everyone agrees the work needs to be done.However, there is no consensus on the way forward.Either way, taxpayers will have to pay for the works and pick up a bill that is expected to run into many billions.",

    "body": "David Dimbleby: Can William's 'ordinary Joe' approach win back more support for the monarchy?4 hours agoDavid DimblebyPresenter, What's the Monarchy For?BBCI've spent much of my career commentating on royal occasions, and over the past two years I've been looking at the institution in close detail for a personal-view documentary series, interviewing former private secretaries and communications advisers, along with royal historians, friends of King Charles III and staunch anti-monarchists, trying to understand how it works and why it has had such a hold on Britain.Now, polls suggest public approval is in decline.When asked how important it was to continue having a monarchy, as part of the first British Social Attitudes survey back in 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\". In last year's survey, just 51% of people answered the same. The proportion of young people approving of the monarchy is lower still.That's not to say that people want an elected head of state instead - a majority don't. And finding an elected President who could unite Scotland England Wales and Northern Ireland would, I suspect, be a good deal harder than some republicans think.But the declining support marks a problem. Getty ImagesIn 1983, 86% of people said it was \"very important\" or \"quite important\" to continue having a monarchy, as part of a British Social Attitudes survey. In last year's survey, 51% of people answered the same\"The only way the monarchy works is by everybody either being apathetic or feeling very affectionate towards it,\" argues Anna Whitelock, a professor of the history of monarchy at City, University of London.\"If those bonds are broken, there really is no purpose or point of monarchy.\"Plenty of people might be quick to put the most recent threat to those bonds down to scandal. There is no love lost between Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, as he is now known, and the British public. Only 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of him in a YouGov poll in October (the same month he was stripped of his titles), followed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with ratings of 30% and 21% respectively.Yet no-one I spoke to while making these films pointed to any one individual as the sole reason for the current standing of the monarchy in the eyes of the public.AFP via Getty ImagesOnly 4% of people had a \"positive\" view of Andrew in a YouGov poll in October, the same month he was stripped of his titlesI suspect the real challenge facing the Royal Family is the fundamental question of what it stands for in the modern world - a world radically different to the one Elizabeth II reigned over when she ascended the throne in 1952.Even though there is evidence that suggests change is on the agenda, as the Prince of Wales acknowledged last month, what should he do, as heir to the throne - and what should King Charles do as reigning monarch - to win back more support for the institution?Winning the 'oxygen of public support'Three monarchs have been on the throne during my lifetime, and each understood that what matters is the impression they make on their subjects: their image.As the journalist and editor Ian Hislop put it when I interviewed him for my documentary series, What's The Monarchy For? \"They thrive on the oxygen of public support\".It is, ultimately, the key to their survival.They surround themselves with people who know this too. Lord Janvrin was the private secretary to the late queen until 2007. \"If you took public support for granted it would be a very bad day,\" he told me.Prof Whitelock takes this a step further. \"The Royal family is a brand,\" she explains. \"There is always a sense of needing to keep the brand popular.\"Getty ImagesThe Prince and Princess of Wales with their children at Westminster Abbey for the 'Together at Christmas' carol serviceOne of the boldest attempts the Royal Family has ever made to redefine its public image - and keep that brand popular - came back in 1969 when, for the first time, they invited cameras into the heart of family life.The film, titled Royal Family, which was broadcast on BBC and ITV, was an attempt to try to humanise them.The late queen was filmed in colour, buying a treat for a four-year-old Prince Edward in a shop, using money from her purse. \"What are you going to have? A lolly?\" she was filmed saying, briskly. \"An ice cream,\" Edward replied. As he settled in the front seat of the car, she suggested he might make a \"gooey mess\".Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThis documentary was, at the time, one of the boldest attempts the Royal Family had made to redefine its public imageThere was a picnic scene too, with Prince Philip and the Princess Royal seen barbecuing sausages.The public lapped it up. Across both transmissions it had almost twice as many viewers as the first moon landing when it broadcast.Yet a few years later, the late queen is reported to have ordered that it should never be seen again. Some reports have suggested there were copyright claims, though the Times also reported speculation that there were concerns, or even regrets about it being made.Fox Photos/Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesA family portrait at Buckingham Palace in 1972Certainly Princess Anne didn't mince her words about the recording. \"I never liked the idea of the royal family film,\" she reportedly once said. \"I always thought it was a rotten idea.\"But it's a good example of how the Royal Family endeavour to present themselves as they want to be seen.'The degree of control I think is staggering'In September 2022, I was at Windsor to report on the final stages of Elizabeth II's funeral. The Palace issued instructions to the broadcasters about scenes that, once shown live, should never be shown again.A number were quite small things, for example, the crown being handled, somebody looking visibly upset, Prince George touching his nose, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh's handkerchiefs, and, at the lying in state, shots of the Royal Family mouthing the Lord's Prayer.These little excisions from reality - or \"perpetuity edits,\" a kind of George Orwell speak - see them remove from the world anything they don't like.On the one hand, they have the right to grieve in private; on the other, the late queen was our head of state and this is her public funeral. Do we have a right to see it all or do they have the right to control what we see?Getty Images\"The degree of control I think is staggering,\" argues Prof Whitelock. \"If Downing Street were trying to control what's being broadcast, that would be reported upon, but if the Palace is intervening in what's being shown about certain things, why is that not seen as something that should be reported?\"However, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace has said: \"The events surrounding the funeral of Her Late Majesty were both State occasions and moments of profound personal sorrow for her loved ones. In striking the appropriate balance between those two factors, simple human decency pointed towards a sensitive and sympathetic approach so as not to intrude on elements of individual grief or personal religious observance.\"In particular, we do not believe it would have been fair or appropriate to focus on younger members of the family at a time of mourning.\"Prince William and the e-scooterRecently, Prince William joined forces with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy for an episode of his travel comedy series that aired last month.Mr Levy appeared particularly amused to see his entrance - zipping around Windsor Castle on an e-scooter.\"It gets around quite nicely,\" the Prince explained, later adding: \"I'm always late so I thought this was a way to keep my meetings on time.\" He chatted on about which of Levy's films he had enjoyed. (\"All of the American Pies!\")A bright idea - the image getting across is that William is just an ordinary Joe.'Stress around family overwhelms me', Prince William saysThe social media posts that Prince William and his family share to their 17.1 million followers have a similar approach, with many showing them off-duty, with videos shot in woods, on sand dunes. One shows the Princess of Wales sharing her relief at having finished chemotherapy treatment, and reflecting on the importance \"of simply loving and being loved\".British \"adman\" Rory Sutherland, who has spent 37 years in the heart of the advertising world, currently as vice-chairman of Ogilvy, fully approves of the Waleses' approach to striking a more modern tone.\"I think he's walked the line, which is a very narrow line between modernity and kind of absurdity extremely well,\" he says of Prince William. \"It is a very delicate path to tread.\"It is, he adds, far less crude than one memorable attempt by the generation before him, when Prince Edward, Princess Anne and Andrew took part in It's a Royal Knockout charity tournament in 1987, presiding over teams of celebrities who wore costumes and did challenges like lobbing ham at each other.And it seems to be resonating. Prince William and Catherine have public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively - higher than all other family members in last month's YouGov survey.Getty ImagesPrince William and Catherine have strong public approval ratings of 76% and 73% respectively,  a YouGov poll suggestsProf Whitelock, though positive about Prince William and his fellow senior Royals' attempts to seem more accessible, is less sure about whether that is enough to modernise the institution as a whole.\"If the monarchy is really to modernise in a significant way, we need to see much more transparency, much more accountability,\" she argues.Tax, politics and royal lifestylesIn talking to people as research for my documentary, there seem to me to be other factors, which are potential stumbling blocks to fuller public support.First, the fact that the monarch is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax on his personal income, because the relevant laws do not apply to the Crown, and only does so voluntarily - and that he was not legally obliged to pay inheritance tax after the death of his mother.\"I think the best way to make those concessions is voluntarily rather than under duress. It's a better look certainly,\" says Rory Sutherland.A spokesperson for Kensington Palace has also said that the Prince of Wales voluntarily pays the top rate of income and capital gains tax on all his personal income, including receipts from the Duchy. No explanation was given, when asked for the documentary series, as to why the Prince of Wales has chosen not to follow his father's example of publishing his tax returns since inheriting the role.Getty ImagesKing Charles is not legally obliged to pay income tax or capital gains tax but does so voluntarilySecond, the fact that the monarch has the right to be consulted on proposed legislation that may affect the Crown and can ask to be excluded from it. The question of whether the monarch takes up this right, or the extent to which it may or may not have an impact, are other matters - some have argued that the right in itself gives any monarch potential to influence.Then there is their lifestyle - particularly  when many people in the country face a cost of living crisis.Mr Sutherland does not believe the fact the royals live in palaces to be something the public particularly cares about. But he adds: \"I always thought that skiing holidays are a bit of a bad look.\"Of course there is the economic case of the sheer amount of money that the Royal Family brings to the UK thanks to tourism - but Mr Sutherland argues that while \"you can emphatically make an economic case\", it is not the right way to justify the royal's continued existence.How European monarchies workPrince William has been forthright in stating that he has change in mind.\"I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda… Not overly radical, but changes that I think need to happen,\" he told Mr Levy.He also said: \"There are points when you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\"So I like to question things, is what I'm really getting at.\"Getty Images'I think it's safe to say that change is on my agenda,' Prince William has saidIt remains unclear exactly what he means by this. Whether it is simply fewer courtiers, a bit less ceremony, no more people calling him sir, or bowing. Or is it possible William envisages much more of a rethink?There has been some debate over the years about whether or not there is merit in a bigger shift: in making the British Royal Family more in line with the Dutch royal family, or the Scandinavian ones with a much more informal and modest style.Prof Whitelock for one believes certain parts of it could well appeal to the prince. \"I don't think the idea of dressing up in all the stuff for the coronation is something that appeals to him.\"But it comes with risks. \"Those who really support the monarchy like all that comes with it, so if we got to a point where we it looks like the Scandinavian monarchies that don't have big coronations… some people might say 'what's the point now'?\"If people are asked what defines Britain,\" she adds, \"I'm sure before too long you do get to the monarch.\"Getty ImagesThe Dutch royal family - King Willem-Alexander attended schools in the Netherlands but finished his secondary education at Atlantic College in WalesGraham Smith, chief executive of pressure group, Republic, is one of those (albeit in a UK minority) who argue that no amount of reform would be enough to win his approval.\"You should not have that family in that position of privilege and status,\" he tells me. \"They are just a bunch of very ordinary people, who just happen to be related to people who, hundreds of years ago, built big castles and won a few battles.\"Essentially, it's a ridiculous institution, which… has no justification.\"AFP via Getty ImagesMany people find having a Royal Family consoling and representative of the United KingdomI put to him that over half the country don't think it's ridiculous - many people find it consoling and representative of the United Kingdom, maybe something better than politicians. The newspapers are full of talk about monarchy too.\"Yes there is an audience,\" he says pointedly. \"But there's also an audience for the Kardashians and David Beckham.\"A masterclass in reinventionI still remember firsthand one of the Royal Family's low points. It was a Sunday in 1997 and I received the news that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in the crash in Paris. I was working at the BBC at the time and we were summoned to cover what had happened.We had no inkling at the time what the public response would be - but it was soon clear that something astonishing was happening.There was an outpouring of popular grief. The press started reporting that thousands of people in London were bringing flowers to Kensington Palace but that the Royal Family had remained up in Balmoral and were not responding.Getty ImagesLord Janvrin was in Balmoral with the late queen. \"A choice had to be made between looking after the two young princes and getting back to London.\"Yet the public criticism was sharp. It was a lesson in the cruel demands of monarchy on those who belong to it. And a lesson to never again get behind the story.Support for the monarchy had already been declining. The year after Diana's death, it dipped further, with just 63.5% of people saying it was important for Britain to have a monarchy, according to the British Attitudes Survey. It took time for the approval ratings to climb back to their previous levels – but eventually they did, reaching 75% by 2012.It shows that this institution can recover from disapproval.Getty ImagesThe present and the future of the monarchy: King Charles III and the Prince of Wales\"It is highly, highly culturally adaptive,\" says Mr Sutherland, \"and obviously an 18th century monarchy might look absurd to us today but at the time it was permanently effectively adapting to changed circumstances, which is one of the reasons it is still around and lots of monarchies aren't.\"No matter what changes Prince William makes - nor Prince George after him - the bigger question of what becomes of the monarchy in the distant future may not be theirs to decide.The monarchy's existence thrives on the \"oxygen of public support\", so it is the public themselves who will decide through that support whether having this kind of head of state continues to suit us as a country.David Dimbleby's documentary series, What's the Monarchy For? starts on Tuesday 2 December on BBC1 and BBC iPlayerMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Husband and wife accused of using spycam and earpieces to win almost £600k at Australian casino14 hours agoAleks PhillipsNSW PoliceThe couple are alleged to have used a hidden camera to read card gamesA husband and wife from Kazakhstan are alleged to have used a hidden camera and earpieces to fraudulently win nearly A$1.2m (£593,000; $784,000) in an Australian casino.The couple were caught after staff at the casino in the central Barangaroo neighbourhood of Sydney noticed Dilnoza Israilova, 36, wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirt, New South Wales Police said.She and her husband, 44-year-old Alisherykhoja Israilov, were then arrested. Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discreet camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games. A New South Wales Police spokesperson told the BBC that they were not currently looking for any other person in relation to the alleged fraud.In a subsequent search of their accommodation near the casino, officers found other \"gambling props\", high-end jewellery and €2,000 (£1,750; $2,320) in cash.The pair appeared in court on Friday and were denied bail, New South Wales police said.Mrs Israilova is due back in court in February, the Guardian Australia reports, while Mr Israilov is scheduled to appear on 11 December.",

    "body": "7 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterGetty ImagesDo you find yourself getting increasingly irate while scrolling through your social media feed?If so, you may be falling victim to rage bait, which Oxford University Press has named its word or phrase of the year.It is a term that describes manipulative tactics used to drive engagement online, with usage of it increasing threefold in the last 12 months, according to the dictionary publisher.Rage bait beat two other shortlisted terms - aura farming and biohack - to win the title.The list of words is intended to reflect some of the moods and conversations that have shaped 2025.What is rage bait?Even if you don't know the term, if you're a social media user, it's quite likely you have been rage baited.According to Oxford University Press, which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary, it is defined as online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive.What is rage baiting and why is it profitable?Such content is typically posted in order to increase traffic to websites or social media accounts.It is similar to its internet cousin clickbait, where a headline is used to lure a reader in to view an article or video.But rage bait content has a more specific focus on making people cross.What do the other shortlisted words mean?Aura farming: The cultivation of an impressive, attractive, or charismatic persona or public image by behaving or presenting oneself in a way intended subtly to convey an air of confidence, coolness, or mystique.Biohack: To attempt to improve or optimise one's physical or mental performance, health, longevity, or wellbeing by altering one's diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle, or by using other means such as drugs, supplements, or technological devices.The three shortlisted words were put to a public vote, the results of which helped to guide the final decision taken by OUP's language experts.\"The fact that the word rage bait exists and has seen such a dramatic surge in usage means we're increasingly aware of the manipulation tactics we can be drawn into online,\" said Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Languages.\"Before, the internet was focused on grabbing our attention by sparking curiosity in exchange for clicks, but now we've seen a dramatic shift to it hijacking and influencing our emotions, and how we respond.\"It feels like the natural progression in an ongoing conversation about what it means to be human in a tech-driven world - and the extremes of online culture.\"Getty ImagesPrevious words of the year have included goblin mode, a slang term for lazy behaviourLast year's word of the year, brain rot, captured the mental drain of mindless scrolling on Instagram or TikTok.Mr Grathwohl said both 2024 and 2025's winners have a similar theme.\"Together, they form a powerful cycle where outrage sparks engagement, algorithms amplify it, and constant exposure leaves us mentally exhausted,\" he said.Previous Oxford words of the year have included selfie, goblin mode and rizz.Cambridge Dictionary has declared parasocial its word of 2025, which it defined as a relationship felt by someone between themselves and a famous person they do not know.Its examples include the interest displayed by fans when pop star Taylor Swift and American footballer Travis Kelce announced their engagement.Meanwhile, Collins Dictionary went for vibe coding, which is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence rather than by writing programming code manually.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPatrick JacksonReutersMarco Rubio (left) with Rustem Umerov in Florida US Secretary of State Marco Rubio says talks with Ukraine over a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war were productive, but there's \"more work to be done\". The talks, held in Florida, were attended by a Ukrainian delegation led by national security council secretary Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's new chief negotiator. Also at the meeting were President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Witkoff is due to visit Moscow for talks next week.  Umerov was brought in to replace the Ukrainian president's top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, after he quit following an anti-corruption raid on his home.Sunday's meeting is the latest step in two weeks of intense diplomatic activity.    It was sparked by the leaking of a 28-point US peace plan which shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago.\"It's not just about the terms that ends fighting,\" Rubio said at the meeting in Hallandale Beach, north of Miami. \"It's about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity... I think we built on that today, but there's more work to be done.\"He also told the Ukrainian delegation that the aim of peace talks with Russia is to leave Ukraine \"sovereign, independent and prosperous\".Watch: Rubio says 'more needs to be done' after 'productive' Ukraine talksAs Sunday's talks began, Umerov said: \"We are discussing about the future of Ukraine, about the security of Ukraine, about no repetition of aggression of Ukraine, about prosperity of Ukraine, about how to rebuild Ukraine\". \"US is hearing us,\" he said, speaking in English. \"US is supporting us. US is working beside us.\"He later described the talks as \"productive and successful\" while Rubio said they had been \"very productive and useful\".Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said the talks were \"going along well\", and there was a good chance of a deal being made to end the conflict. Trump said earlier he would send Witkoff and possibly also Kushner to Moscow this week to meet President Vladimir Putin to discuss the peace plan which has been much revised. In a post on social media, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"It is important that the talks have a constructive dynamic and that all issues were discussed openly and with a clear focus on ensuring Ukraine's sovereignty and national interests.\"He added he was grateful to the US and Trump for their efforts to try and end the war. One crucial unresolved issue is the fate of Ukrainian territory that Russia has either annexed or controls.The talks in Florida were \"not easy\", a source who is said to be close to the Ukrainian delegation told AFP news agency.\"But everyone is trying to be constructive and find a solution,\" the source added.  Zelensky is due to visit Paris on Monday for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong ally.  Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed or injured, as well as thousands of civilians, and at least seven million people have become refugees since Russia invaded on 24 February 2022.     The conflict between the two ex-Soviet states stretches back to 2014 when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and supporting armed uprisings in eastern Ukraine.

    "body": "The abrupt cancellations of several Japanese music events in Shanghai - one of them midway through a song - have sparked criticism among fans, with some calling the moves \"rude\" and \"extreme\".Maki Otsuki was halfway through the theme of hit anime One Piece on Friday when the lights and music went off, after which she was rushed off stage by two crew members.On Saturday, pop star Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai, citing \"force majeure\".This spate of cancellations come as diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Tokyo fester over Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on Taiwan.Takaichi, known to be a vocal critic of China and its activities in the region, suggested last month that Tokyo could take military action if Beijing attacked Taiwan.Beijing views self-governed Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to \"reunite\" with it.Both sides have since lodged protests against each other, and the rift has also affected daily living in both countries.Otsuki's management attributed the interruption of her performance on Friday to \"unavoidable circumstances\". \"Other than the performance being cancelled, there were no particular problems, and the local staff were very kind and helpful,\" it wrote in a separate statement on Monday, in which it declined interviews on the matter.Her performance was part of a three-day music festival in Shanghai, for which subsequent events were also called off after \"comprehensively taking into consideration various factors\", according to Japan's Kyodo News.The BBC has reached out to Japanese entertainment company Bandai Namco, who is one of the organisers of the festival.Some of Otsuki's fans have made a meme comparing the shutting down of her performance with the shocking removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The meme went viral on social media, over the weekend, with some saying Ms Otsuki was given \"the Hu Jintao treatment\".On social media, some accused the Chinese authorities of taking away its own people's freedom to enjoy culture, in its attempts to sanction Japan. \"What's the point of turning the spearhead toward its own citizens?\" read an X post written in Japanese.\"Don't you care about the audience - they are after all Chinese, right?\" wrote a user on China's X-like platform Weibo. George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, joined the conversation online. \"It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music,\" he wrote in an X post which also included a link to Journey's Don't Stop Believin'. \"Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!\" he wrote.However the incident also fanned nationalist sentiments on Chinese social media, with some asking why the event was allowed in the first place given the diplomatic row. \"How could the event have gone on at a time when the whole nation is angry with Japan?\" a Weibo user wrote.Hamasaki, who was in Shanghai as part of her Asia tour, said she was suddenly asked on Friday to cancel her concert. The pop icon went ahead to perform to 14,000 empty seats as part of her appreciation for the \"people in the company, the Chinese staff, and the large Japanese family that fought through this tour\" she wrote on Instagram.\"I still strongly believe that entertainment should be a bridge that connects people, and I want to be on the side of creating that bridge,\" she wrote.Two weeks ago, Chinese state media announced that the releases of at least two popular Japanese anime films will be postponed amid the diplomatic row.

    "body": "Tories urge financial regulator to investigate Reeves and Treasury over Budget build-up7 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterGetty ImagesShadow chancellor Mel Stride has called for the UK's financial regulator to investigate \"possible market abuse\" by people working in the Treasury and Downing Street in the run-up to the Budget.The move comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves denied she misled the public over the state of the country's finances, after it emerged she and officials had been told they were in better shape than widely thought - but she still gave briefings that the Tories described as overly pessimistic.The Conservatives have called on her to resign and Stride sent a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requesting a probe into potential market manipulation.\"Confidential market sensitive information appears to have been spun, leaked and misused - and markets, businesses and families have paid the price,\" he claimed.The FCA regulates financial services firms in the UK and part of its role is handling and investigating reports of market abuse, such as insider dealing or market manipulation.In his letter to the head of the regulator, Stride outlined briefings which were made in the run-up to the Budget over the picture of the country's finances, the economy, and speculation over tax rises.\"It seems increasingly clear that the chancellor has been giving an inaccurate picture of the economic and fiscal context and this appears to be driven by political considerations,\" he wrote.He claimed \"leaks and spin\" from the Treasury had led to market speculation being \"rife and the gilt markets volatile\".The FCA has confirmed it received the letter and the BBC understands it will respond. The reaction of financial markets has been closely watched in the run-up and aftermath of the Budget giving the impact the tax and spending policies could have on UK borrowing costs.Many governments sell bonds - essentially IOUs - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest. But how credible the markets deem a chancellor's grip on the finances can affect how much it costs governments to borrow money. Following Reeves's Budget on Wednesday, the cost of government borrowing fell slightly, signalling a vote of confidence with the policy annoucements.Reeves announced a series of tax rises, and extended a further three-year freeze of the thresholds at which people pay tax and higher income tax rates, meaning millions of people will be pulled in and have to pay more from their pay packets. She also scrapped the two-child benefit cap.But the chancellor has faced since accusations she misled the public about the state of the public finances in the run-up.Reeves repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her borrowing rules, fuelling speculation that the income tax rates themselves would be raised, which would break a manifesto pledge.On 4 November, she used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, Reeves told the BBC: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"However, it has since emerged that the Office for Budget Responsbility (OBR) had told the Treasury on 31 October that it was on course to meet its main borrowing rule by £4.2bn, although the figure was less than the £9.9bn buffer Reeves had left herself last year.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he also told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.Jeff Overs/BBCAs well as the Conservatives, the SNP has also written to the FCA urging it to look into claims of \"deliberately false and misleading\" briefings.Reports in the run-up to the Budget had suggested the chancellor could have faced a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules as a result of the OBR's productivity downgrade.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called on Reeves to resign.\"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR had told her the complete opposite,\" she said.\"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare.\"The Tories have written to the prime minister calling for Reeves to come before MPs on Monday to explain her conduct surrounding the Budget and period leading to it. Reeves hit back at critics on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, arguing the £4.2bn headroom she had wasn't an \"extra 4bn to play with\", but rather a downgrade from the £9.9bn buffer she had last year.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBrajesh UpadhyayWashingtonUS lawmakers are pressing the Trump administration for answers about military strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug boats, following reports that a follow-up strike was ordered to kill survivors of an initial attack.Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct  \"vigorous oversight\" into the US boat strikes in the Caribbean, following the report.On Friday, The Washington Post reported that a US strike on a boat on 2 September left two survivors, but a second attack was carried out to comply with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's orders  to \"kill everybody\" on board.Hegseth decried the report as \"fake news\" and President Donald Trump said he believed him \"a 100%\".The US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean and carried out a series of lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats in international waters off Venezuela and Colombia, as part of what it calls is an anti-narcotics operation.More than 80 people have been killed since early September.The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US. In its report on Friday, The Washington Post wrote that Secretary Hegseth \"gave a spoken directive\" to \"kill everybody\" on board one such vessel, and a Special Operations commander overseeing the operation \"ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth's instructions\".Republican and Democrat lawmakers appearing on Sunday talk shows said they supported congressional reviews of US military strikes on vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean.The leaders said they did not know whether The Washington Post's report was true, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike presented major legal concerns.\"This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" said Democrat Senator Tim Kaine on CBS Face the Nation.Republican lawmaker Mike Turner said Congress did not have information that the follow-up strike had happened.\"Obviously if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,\" Turner, a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, told CBS.The comments follow the Republican-led Senate Armed Services Committee's announcement on Friday that they planned to conduct \"vigorous oversight\" on the strikes.\"The Committee is aware of recent news reports – and the Department of Defense's initial response – regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,\" the committee's Republican chair, Senator Roger Wicker, and his Democrat counterpart, Senator Jack Reed, said in a statement.\"The Committee has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,\" they said.The House Armed Services Committee too followed suit, saying they were \"taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".In a post on X, Hegseth pushed back against the accusation, calling it \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". He wrote that the series of strikes on boats were \"lawful under both US and international law\".\"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,\" he wrote.On Sunday, talking to reporters aboard Air Force One, President Trump defended his defence secretary, saying: \"He said he did not say that. And I believe him a 100%.\"Trump said the administration \"will look into\" the matter and added \"I wouldn't have wanted that - not a second strike\".On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the accusations of a second attack that allegedly killed two survivors.The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government.The US is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the US military's legal advisors have previously said that the US should \"act in a manner consistent with its provisions\".Under the convention, countries agree not to interfere with vessels operating in international waters. There are limited exceptions to this which allow a state to seize a ship, such as a \"hot pursuit\" where a vessel is chased from a country's waters into the high seas.\"Force can be used to stop a boat but generally this should be non-lethal measures,\" Prof Luke Moffett of Queens University Belfast recently told BBC Verify.",

    "body": "Reeves denies she misled public over UK's finances in run-up to Budget6 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterLaura Kuenssberg presses Rachel Reeves on whether the public was misled before BudgetChancellor Rachel Reeves has rejected claims she misled the public about the nation's finances in the run-up to her Budget.Reeves was challenged on the BBC to explain why she had repeatedly warned about a downgrade to the UK's economic productivity forecasts - including in a speech on 4 November - ahead of Wednesday's Budget.It has since emerged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) told her in mid-September the public finances were in better shape than widely thought, with Reeves omitting to mention a forecast of higher wages.Reeves said the OBR figures were clear there had been \"less fiscal space than there was\" and that she had been \"upfront\" about her decision-making. But Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch repeated her call for the chancellor to quit.When pressed on the issue on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Reeves said she did not \"accept\" she had been misleading. Badenoch, also appearing on the programme, said she was not satisfied with the chancellor's denial, however.The Conservatives have accused the chancellor of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes, with Badenoch claiming Reeves had \"lied to the public\".But Downing Street has denied the accusations and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to back Reeves' budget decisions in a speech on Monday, saying the chancellor's decisions would help tackle cost of living pressures and lower inflation.Reeves was asked by Kuenssberg if she could be trusted, responding that she could.Kuenssberg then outlined what the chancellor said in a speech on 4 November, when Reeves indicated there was less cash than previously forecast due to a productivity downgrade, and she was likely going to need to raise taxes as a result.Reeves explained that, despite what critics were saying, \"I didn't have an extra £4bn to play with\" but instead that the OBR figures had been downgraded from £9.9bn headroom in spring to £4.2bn in the autumn.Headroom is the term for money left over after the government meets its expected budget costs under its own fiscal rules, providing a financial buffer for unexpected costs.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"Pushed on whether she had exaggerated the situation in order to pave the way for a £16bn increase in welfare, Reeves said she also had to factor in policy choices made in the previous six months on welfare and the Winter Fuel Allowance.She said: \"I did say when those policies changed just before the summer that we would have to find that money in the Budget, so I was very upfront about that.\"Yes, I did make the decision in the Budget to scrap the two-child [benefit] limit  - that was funded by increases on online gambling taxes and also by cracking down on tax avoidance and tax evasion, fully costed and fully funded, and lifting half a million children out of poverty.\"Asked if she had broken the spirit, if not the letter, of her manifesto commitment on taxation by freezing income tax thresholds, Reeves said: \"I recognise I did not say that in the manifesto, but since then we've had both a significant downgrade in the productivity forecast but also huge global turbulence.\"She added: \"I have to respond to all those things because, if I were to lose control of the public  finances, we would be punished.\"Punished by financial markets that hold £2.6tn of public debt, and punished with higher interest rates, which wouldn't affect just the country but would also affect every single business that borrows, and every single family that has a mortgage.\"Kemi Badenoch on Reeves: 'I believe she should resign'Badenoch said she was \"absolutely not\" satisfied with Reeves' explanation and she should instead have cut welfare spending. She said: \"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR was telling her the complete opposite. \"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare - the only thing that was unfunded was the welfare payments that she has made, and she's doing it on the backs of a lot of people out there who are working very hard and getting poorer - and because of that I believe she should resign.\"She accused the chancellor of trying to \"pitch-roll her budget - tell everyone how awful it would be and then they wouldn't be as upset when she finally announced it\", which could constitute \"market manipulation\".Tory shadow chancellor Mel Stride has written to the Financial Conduct Authority asking it to investigate \"possible market abuse\" by people working in the Treasury and Downing Street in the run-up to the Budget. The SNP has also written to the body.The Conservatives have also written to the prime minister calling for Reeves to come before MPs on Monday to explain her conduct surrounding the Budget and period leading to it.Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage has reported Reeves to the the independent adviser on ministerial ethics to investigate whether she broke the ministerial code over her pre-Budget interventions.Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said there were \"very serious questions to answer\" and is understood to have submitted an urgent question in Parliament on the issue.Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "4 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaJeremy Corbyn argues Your Party is the best opportunity to create \"a socialist party of mass appeal\" in the UKYour Party has not got off to the smoothest of starts.The path to this weekend's founding conference has been overshadowed by splits in the party over everything from money, leadership to even its name.The conference opened with a round of expulsions of members and founding MP Zarah Sultana boycotting the first day, in protest against what she called a \"witch hunt\".But after months of speculation, the party now has a name and a constitution that will see it led by a \"revolutionary\" new system - controlled by ordinary members rather than a single leader.Some of the structural issues, at least, are settled, but a chaotic conference could set the tone and roadmap on where the start-up party goes from here.The last time Jeremy Corbyn spoke from the stage in Liverpool's ACC conference centre's sprawling complex of glass and steel, he was leader of the Labour party.Back then he spoke to a party scarred by infighting, just over a year away from a historic defeat in the 2019 general election.As he stepped on stage to address his start-up political party on Saturday, much had changed.Not only is Corbyn no longer the Labour leader, he has been kicked out of the party – an event that set him on the path to founding Your Party.But he found himself once again addressing a party mired in factional in-fighting.Absent from the audience was a quarter of the party's parliamentary contingent after Sultana had refused to enter, angry over what she saw as \"faceless bureaucrats\" kicking out members who also belonged to the Socialist Workers Party.Party officials said they had been expelled due to a clear breach of the rules that banned members from belonging to other political parties. And they were not the only ones missing. The ambition had been to bring 13,000 delegates to Liverpool.But that was revised down to 2,500 – which made the cavernous halls of the conference centre feel much emptier.Outside the hall, as the wind whipped in off the Mersey, a small group of protesters sought to highlight the expulsions.Speaking into the megaphone, Mish Rahman - a former member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee who quit the party claiming it had become \"devoid of integrity\" under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer  - turned on his new party.Paraphrasing Angela Davis, the US Black Panther activist, Rahman called on members to \"no longer accept the things you cannot change – change the things you cannot accept\".He was echoing many points made by fellow ex-Labour member Max Shanly, who a day earlier had told a rally they needed to change the party \"by any means necessary\".Inside the echoey conference hall, Corbyn used his opening speech to call for unity, telling the audience that \"division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent\".The fledgling party had \"a unique opportunity\" to found \"a socialist party of mass appeal\" that could take on the mainstream parties of parliament, he said.Despite Corbyn's plea, much of the debate was dominated by discussions of a \"purge\" of members expelled for being members of other left-wing groups.At points there was a sense the conference was being held together by a diminishing pool of good will. Asking exhausted organisers how the project was going normally elicited more tired laughs or horrified stares than answers.Getty ImagesCrowds followed Zarah Sultana, who made most of the headlines throughout Your Party conference But if the drama has drained the mood at the top, it did not kill the buzz on the floor.During a break in proceedings, Nick Parker, a party organiser from Lincoln, said \"disagreements are natural, because we all recognise that it's a really important project that we're trying to build\".The feuds were \"a side issue\" detracting from broad agreement on a \"political programme fighting back against cuts, against privatisation, against war, against racism\", he said. Bonnie Ambrose agreed. There is \"no perfect way\" to found a party, she said.\"But by God, we need it – and what came across strongly was that we were all determined to make a difference,\" she said.Maybe this is just what democracy looks like.A deeply unpopular Labour government, seen by the delegates here as copying the Reform UK message on immigration, has freed up yet more support to a left-wing alternative.The Green Party, who have reached record membership numbers under self-described eco-populist Zack Polanski, do not fit the bill.A group of young activists who do not want to give their names say while the Greens \"talk the talk\", they fail to put the \"working class at their heart\".EPAThe Your Party conference hall frequently erupted into cheers louder than you would expect from 2,500 peopleIt is fair to say Your Party leaves Liverpool transformed from the party that arrived. It has a name, a constitution, a leadership model and a clear promise that power will flow outwards to members and into communities.There are no official policies yet, but the party's political statement agreed at the conference defines it as a \"member-led socialist party\" with \"the working class\" at its heart.We are told the party has 55,000 paid-up members. Asked if Your Party was now the largest explicitly socialist party in the UK, a coffee-stained party official replies \"you're god damn right\".Branches will now be built across the UK, with local members given greater autonomy over selecting representatives and punishing those that fail to toe the party line.The first-year strategy, also agreed at conference, sets out plans on training community organisers and a push to root the party in trade unions.That vision feels a long way off in a half-empty hall.Polling had once suggested up to 18% of the public would consider voting for a Corbyn-led party – potentially returning dozens of MPs in the fractured multi-party voting in a first past-the-post electoral.That number has dropped to just 12% after months of public psychodrama.The party will now get on with the job of putting the new rules into action – including choosing candidates for next May's local elections.It will also hope that it can put behind it months of public bickering and prove to the electorate it is a serious political force worth voting for.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKostas KoukoumakasThessaly, central GreeceAFP via Getty ImagesSheep and goats across Greece have been hit by outbreaks of poxHundreds of thousands of sheep and goats are being culled in Greece, due to the outbreak of an infectious disease. It may affect production and exports of the country's famous feta cheese.Anastasia Siourtou walks through her deserted farm on the outskirts of Karditsa, a city in the Thessaly region of central Greece.An eerie silence hangs over the place where 650 sheep were being raised.On 12 November veterinary officials culled all the livestock after a case of sheep and goat pox was detected.\"There is another farm two kilometres away. They had pox cases, but hid it,\" she says, alluding to how she believes her herd contracted the disease.Ms Siourtou is a veterinarian herself and has expanded the farm that her father built.Losing the animals means financial ruin - besides the livestock the farm lost, the sheep's milk, which is sold for the production of feta cheese, is often referred to as Greece's \"white gold\".More than the financial blow, however, Ms Siourtou speaks of the emotional toll. \"I was here the day the sheep were culled. It is very cruel, I felt that I failed to protect them.\"Farmer Anastasia Siourtou says she feels that she failed to protect her sheepSheep and goat pox is a viral infection. The first cases were detected in northern Greece in August 2024, and the disease has since spread across many regions of the country.A total of 1,702 incidents had been recorded by mid-November, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.Detecting a single case on a farm means the entire herd must be culled for preventive reasons. Some 417,000 sheep and goats have been disposed of so far, which is roughly 4-5% of the previous total.Approximately 80% of Greek sheep and goat's milk goes towards making feta cheese, which is a protected designation of origin within the European Union.This means that while similar cheese can be produced elsewhere in the EU it cannot be called feta. The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.Last year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.Feta has to be made of at least 70% sheep's milk, with the remainder being goat's.Small dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep's milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.\"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market,\" says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.Another sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.He now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. \"The shop is closed,\" he says bitterly.Mr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. \"I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.\"The day they were culled, I was here. If you cut me that day, I wouldn't bleed.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAuthentic feta cheese can only come from GreeceHe is flipping thoughtfully through a government document packed with numerical tables.Affected farmers are being offered compensation of between €132 and €220 per sheep depending on its age. Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.The government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.Meanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.At the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.A spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"Greece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.Across the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.The BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.The owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.Sheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.Such vaccination is allowed in an emergency under EU rules, and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.However, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.Prof Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"Farmer Tassos Manakas says he is closed for businessYet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.Members of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.But many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.Farmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.It was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.There are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.Mr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\"Read more global business stories",

    "body": "1 day agoBob HowardDublinNurPhoto via Getty ImagesJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"Jack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"Ireland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.Pubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetusesIt was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of DublinThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll beTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drinkHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028. It said the decision to defer was made following concerns raised about the impact of their implementation in the current global trading environment.More weekend picks",

    "body": "Billy Bonds, who has died aged 79, was one of the greatest players ever to represent West Ham United and one of the finest never to win a full England cap.Bonds was the very embodiment of the West Ham spirit, the bearded and buccaneering captain who later managed the club, a figure of huge significance who fits alongside World Cup-winning trio Bobby Moore, Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in the Hammers' Hall Of Fame.\"Rest in peace Billy, our courageous, inspirational, lion-hearted leader\" read West Ham United's statement announcing his death – and every one of the club's supporters who watched Bonds play, or heard about his deeds, will echo that message.Bonds joined West Ham from Charlton Athletic for £47,000 in May 1967, the start of a magnificent 21-year career on the field that saw him become the club's longest-serving player, making 799 appearances.He was initially signed as a right-back before becoming an outstanding midfielder who later played as an accomplished central defender, proving a worthy successor to Moore as West Ham captain when he departed for Fulham in 1974.Bonds subsequently led West Ham to two FA Cup wins, against Fulham, who had Moore in their team, in 1975, then a shock win as a Second Division side against Arsenal in 1980, Sir Trevor Brooking's header proving decisive.Moore had been captain when West Ham won the FA Cup in 1964 then the European Cup Winners' Cup a year later. Bonds almost emulated the achievement when he was captain as West Ham reached the European Cup Winners' Cup Final in 1976, losing 4-2 to Anderlecht.As well as those FA Cup wins, he led West Ham back into the former First Division at the end of the 1980/81 season, a campaign during which they also lost to Liverpool in the League Cup Final after a replay.It was not just team honours he collected during that time. Bonds, who won the coveted \"Hammer Of The Year\" four times, was handed the Professional Footballers' Association Merit award in 1988, and also received the MBE for services to football in the same year.Bonds was named as the club's greatest-ever player by West Ham fans in 2018.The fact that Bonds never won a full England cap has been a source of contention for decades, particularly among West Ham supporters, his name also placed alongside the likes of Manchester United's Steve Bruce and Everton midfield man Howard Kendall among those who never gained the accolade.Bonds was an unused substitute when England, with his former West Ham manager Ron Greenwood in charge, beat Italy 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley in November 1977.He missed out narrowly again in May 1981 when he was in line for selection for England's friendly against Brazil at Wembley, only to sustain broken ribs in a clash with his own goalkeeper Phil Parkes at the end of the season, ruling him out.The opportunity never came again.He was appointed West Ham manager in February 1990, succeeding Lou Macari, subsequently taking the club back into the top-flight.Bonds was also in charge when West Ham reached the FA Cup semi-final in 1991, but West Ham never recovered from Tony Gale's controversial first-half sending off, losing 4-0 to Nottingham Forest.West Ham were relegated in 1992, but the club kept faith with Bonds and he brought them back into the new Premier League a year later.Bonds' 27-year career at West Ham ended in 1994, when he was succeeded at West Ham by Harry Redknapp.He returned to management with West Ham's fierce rivals Millwall in May 1997, but it was a short-lived, unsuccessful spell and he left the following year.It will always be West Ham's name that is inexorably attached to Bonds. He was presented with the club's Lifetime Achievement Award, the first time it was presented, in 2013 and was visibly emotional when the club re-named the East Stand at the London Stadium in his honour in February 2019.In contrast to the combative captain on the field, Bonds was a private family man away from it. They were at his side, along with many former colleagues, as he was moved to tears when he addressed West Ham's fans after the re-naming of the stand.Bonds was an all-action, versatile player who mixed remarkable fitness, a fiercely competitive nature and skill into a potent combination that was at the heart of everything he and West Ham did.Football fans of a certain age, especially at West Ham, will conjure up instant images of the bearded Bonds, caked in mud from the 70s and 80s pitches, socks rolled down and his head occasionally bandaged up – but always ready to carry the fight to the opposition.Billy Bonds was a captain, player and manager who will always be remembered when the history of West Ham is written.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMax Hudson,Oana MarocicoandSarah Buckley,BBC Eye InvestigationsShutterstockProtesters against the Georgian government have complained of long-lasting symptoms after being sprayed by water cannonGeorgia's authorities used a World War One-era chemical weapon to quell anti-government protesters last year, evidence gathered by the BBC suggests.\"You could feel [the water] burning,\" one of the protesters said of water cannon turned on him and others on the streets of the capital Tbilisi. A sensation, he said, which could not immediately be washed off.Demonstrators against the Georgian government's suspension of its European Union accession bid have complained of other symptoms too - shortness of breath, coughing, and vomiting that lasted for weeks.Gela KhasaiaOne of the protesters, Gela Khasaia, says his skin burned after being sprayed with the cannonThe BBC World Service has spoken to chemical weapons experts, whistleblowers from Georgia's riot police, and doctors, and found the evidence points to the use of an agent that the French military named \"camite\".The Georgian authorities said our investigation findings were \"absurd\" and the police had acted legally in response to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".Camite was deployed by France against Germany during World War One. There is little documentation of its subsequent use, but it is believed to have been taken out of circulation at some point in the 1930s, because of concerns about its long-lasting effects. CS gas - often referred to as \"tear gas\" - was used as a replacement.Konstantine Chakhunashvili was one of those who gathered outside Georgia's parliament in Tbilisi during the first week of protests - which began on 28 November 2024. Demonstrators were incensed by the ruling party's announcement that it was pausing EU accession talks. The goal of EU membership is enshrined in Georgia's constitution.Dr Konstantine Chakhunashvili ran a study on protesters' symptoms after he himself suffered ill-effects from the water cannonGeorgia's police responded with a variety of riot-control measures including the use of water cannon, pepper spray and CS gas.Dr Chakhunashvili, a paediatrician who was among those sprayed by the cannons, and who has taken part in many of the demonstrations, said his skin felt like it was burning for days, and the sensation couldn't be washed away. In fact, he said, \"it was worse when trying to wash it off\".Dr Chakhunashvili wanted to find out if others had suffered similar effects. So he appealed, via social media, for those also targeted by crowd control measures during the first week of the demonstrations to fill out a survey. Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.These long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.His study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.Sixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.Dr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.Several high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.A former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.Lasha ShergelashviliLasha Shergelashvili used to be in charge of weaponry for Georgia's riot policeThe effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas. Even after we washed our faces with water, and then with a special solution of baking soda and water, which was prepared in advance, we still couldn't breathe freely.\"Mr Shergelashvili says that as a result of his tests, he recommended against the chemical's use. But he says the water cannon vehicles were nevertheless loaded with it - and that this remained the case at least up until 2022, when he quit his job and left the country.Speaking from his new home in Ukraine, he tells the BBC that when watching footage of the protests last year, he immediately suspected that demonstrators were being subjected to the same chemical.Colleagues he has remained in touch with, and who are still in post, have also told him this is the case, he adds.And the BBC spoke to another former high-level police officer who confirmed that whatever was loaded into the water cannon vehicles when Mr Shergelashvili was in position was the same compound deployed in the protests of November-December 2024.Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye at 19:00, 1 December on BBC Two Outside the UK, watch the film on BBC World Service YouTubeWhen Mr Shergelashvili was asked if the product he tested could have just been CS gas - which irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory system, but only temporarily -  he said it appeared to be far stronger than that.\"I cannot name an example or compare it with anything [else],\" he said, adding it was \"probably 10 times\" stronger than more conventional riot-control agents.\"For example, if you spill this chemical on the ground, you won't be able to stay in that area for the next two to three days, even if you wash it off with water.\"Mr Shergelashvili does not know the name of the chemical he was asked to test.But the BBC managed to obtain a copy of the inventory of the Special Tasks Department, dated December 2019.We discovered it contained two unnamed chemicals. These were simply listed as \"Chemical liquid UN1710\" and \"Chemical powder UN3439\", along with instructions for how they should be mixed.We wanted to check whether this inventory was authentic, so we showed it to another  former high-ranking police officer from the riot police who confirmed it seemed genuine. He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.Our next step was to work out what these chemicals were.UN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.UN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.The only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.We asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.ShutterstockHuge crowds outside Georgia's parliament in November last yearBased on the results of Dr Chakhunashvili's study, victim testimony, the riot police inventory, and Mr Shergelashvili's account of the chemical tests, Prof Holstege believes that this is the case.\"Based on the available evidence… the clinical findings reported by both those exposed and by other witnesses are consistent with bromobenzyl cyanide.\"He ruled out the likelihood of the symptoms being caused by more conventional crowd control measures, such as CS gas, which was also being deployed by Georgia's riot police last year.\"The persistence of the clinical effects… is not consistent with the typical agents used for crowd dispersal, such as CS,\" he said.\"I've never seen camite being utilised in modern society. Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"He speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"Camite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.Under international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.Given there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.Our findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards. Ms Edwards has previously written to Georgia's government regarding allegations of police violence and torture during the protests.The UN's Alice Edwards: \"Populations should never be subjected to experiments\"The lack of strict regulation around the use of chemicals in water cannon is a problem she would like addressed: \"It does lead me to consider [this practice] as an experimental weapon. And populations should never be subjected to experiments. This is absolutely in violation of human rights law.\"She stressed that any effect of a riot control measure should be temporary under international law, and that the symptoms described \"are beyond what would be considered temporary and acceptable. So all of those cases should be investigated, including under the rubric of torture or other ill-treatment\".Georgia's authorities described our findings as \"deeply frivolous\" and \"absurd\".It said that law enforcement had acted \"within the bounds of the law and constitution\" when responding to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".The protests on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue have dwindled in their size since the government increased fines and jail terms, but not in their frequency.Almost every night for the past year, demonstrators have called for the resignation of a government they accuse of rigging elections, siding with Russian interests, and passing increasingly draconian legislation against civil society.The ruling Georgian Dream party denied the government or the party's honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, are either pro-Russian or pursuing Russian interests. It told the BBC that legislative changes over the past year served the best interests of \"public welfare\".",

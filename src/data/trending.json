    "body": "12 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, HelsinkiPA MediaYvette Cooper watched Finnish border agents demonstrate how they seize Russian boatsForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has told the BBC the UK is ready to work with European allies to intercept sanction-busting oil tankers in Russia's shadow fleet.She was speaking on board a patrol ship in Helsinki harbour where she watched armed border agents rappel from a helicopter to show how they seize Russian vessels.Cooper promised more \"assertive action\" to \"tighten the chokehold\" on the shadow fleet with more \"disruption\" and \"enforcement measures\".Last week British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic which US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.The foreign secretary told the BBC: \"We've already acted in support of US action, and you've seen the interdiction we've taken, we also stand ready to work with other countries and with other allies on the kind of enforcement action we need there.\"Cooper was briefed on the Turva offshore patrol vessel which two weeks ago detained a cargo vessel called the Fitburg suspected of damaging an undersea cable in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.\"We're going to look at a wide range of ways in which to increase that pressure on the Russian shadow fleet,\" she said.\"We need to protect our undersea cables. We need to protect our critical national infrastructure and protect our environment from these often decrepit and dangerous vessels that are also fuelling the war in Ukraine, and that's why we'll take that stronger action. \"We're ready for much stronger enforcement, a much more assertive and robust approach, so that we don't have that navigation becoming sabotage instead.\"To date, no UK military personnel have boarded any vessels.PA MediaBBC News understands the government has identified a legal basis to allow the UK military to board and detain vessels in so-called shadow fleets.The Sanctions and Money Laundering Act, from 2018 can be used to approve the use of military force, ministers believe.Cooper said the shadow fleet was not just fuelling the war in Ukraine by allowing Russia to evade sanctions, but it was also a threat to UK national security. She told the BBC: \"I've been talking to our Finnish allies about the action that they're taking against the shadow fleet, but also the intensifying action that we all want to take together now we're determined to have a much more assertive approach to tighten that chokehold on the Russian shadow fleet.\"Cooper added that the government was also working internationally to pursue a maritime services ban.ReutersOil tanker Marinera was seized by the US Coast Guard last weekLast week, British armed forces supported the seizure of the Marinera which was stopped by the US Coast Guard as it travelled northwards through waters between Iceland and Scotland. The Russian-flagged oil tanker seized is accused of being part of a shadow fleet breaking US sanctions. But Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Shadow fleets, or ghost fleets, are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries. The ships are often ageing tankers and use false flags to try and avoid detection.",

    "body": "Ukraine has declared a state of emergency in the country's energy sector, with a particular focus on Kyiv, as ongoing Russian strikes continue to leave thousands of residents without power. President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting the harsh winter conditions as part of its war strategy, with overnight temperatures in Kyiv recently dropping to around -20C.The declaration comes as Zelensky's US counterpart Donald Trump said he was holding up efforts to secure a peace deal to end nearly four years of war with Russia.He told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Ukraine \"is less ready to make a deal\" than Russian president Vladimir Putin. When asked why peace talks have not yet resolved the conflict, Trump responded: \"Zelensky\".The two leaders are both expected to attend the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week, although Trump suggested no formal plans were arranged for them to meet. In recent weeks, Russian attacks on Kyiv have left thousands of homes without regular power, heating or running water. After one particularly heavy night of missile and drone attacks last week, 70% of the capital was left without power for several hours.Following a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Zelensky said a round-the-clock task force would be set up to fix damage caused by Russian strikes and worsening weather conditions. He said the new measures would include procuring vital energy equipment and resources from abroad to replace damaged installations. \"The First Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Energy of Ukraine has been assigned to oversee work supporting people and communities under these conditions,\" he wrote on X.He also ordered an increase in the number of emergency help points around Kyiv to provide heat and power for residents, a move which could see a relaxing of current midnight curfew in the capital.Russian attacks on energy infrastructure have not been limited to the capital.Last week, Ukrainian officials said that more than one million people in south-eastern Ukraine spent hours without heating and water supplies as a result of Russian air strikes. DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its CEO, Maxim Timchenko, told the BBC last month.As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and the company had found it difficult to cope.He added that the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".DTEK currently provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesWest Sussex is among the councils requesting an elections delay About a third of eligible councils in England have asked to postpone their elections due in May, according to BBC research.Last month ministers told 63 local authorities they would authorise delays to the polls if there were \"genuine concerns\" about delivering them alongside the government's overhaul of local government.Twenty-one councils have asked to postpone their ballots ahead of a Thursday deadline, whilst 34 will not, and eight are yet to confirm their position.Ministers are expected to approve the requests in the coming days.The government's rejig of local government will replace the two-tier system of district and county councils that exists in many parts of England with new 'unitary' councils responsible for delivering all councils services in their area.It means some of the councils up for election this year will be folded into new unitary councils in 2027 or 2028, so councillors could only be in office for a year.The BBC contacted the 63 councils who could request a delay to their May elections to ask for their decision.Among those to say they will ask for a postponement are East and West Sussex County Councils, Suffolk County Council, Exeter City Council, Preston City Council and Peterborough City Council.Other smaller councils to request a delay include Cheltenham, Hastings, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Ipswich, and Redditch Borough Councils.Most wanting a delay are Labour-led, but three are Conservative-led and one is Liberal Democrat led. Some of the councils that have asked for a delay are run by more than one party, or independents.'Running scared'Ministers say their reorganisation of local council will be the biggest in a generation, removing duplication and simplifying local government.Writing for The Times, Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Running a series of elections for short-lived zombie councils will be costly, time consuming and will take scarce resources away from front-line services like fixing pot holes and social care.\"The Conservatives and the Lib Dems have both criticised Labour's decision to allow elections to be postponed, whilst Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that authorities wanting a delay were \"terrified\" his party would win.Conservative shadow local government secretary accused Labour of \"running scared of voters,\" with the government struggling in the polls.\"We are clear that these elections should go ahead. Ministers should treat voters with respect instead of disdain, stop undermining our democratic system and let the people of this country make their own decisions,\" he added.Council protestsLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has previously suggested delaying elections breached human rights, called for a change in the law so \"ministers cannot simply delay elections at the stroke of a pen\".He said: \"Both Labour and the Conservatives are running scared of the electorate, allowing councillors to serve terms of up to seven years without a democratic mandate.\"Despite their parties' official positions, the Conservative leaders of Suffolk, West Sussex, and East Sussex County Councils, and the Liberal Democrat controlled Cheltenham Borough Council are among those requesting a delay.Protests erupted at some councils over decisions to ask for a delay, with police called to a meeting in Redditch where the Labour-run district council in Worcestershire discussed asking for a postponement.Some councils have yet to announce their decision.The Conservative leader of Essex County Council told the government there was \"huge strain on our systems\" on top of the planned restructure. But he said it was up to the government whether this year's elections would go ahead, and said he would not call for a delay. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentTwo alleged Palestine Action activists who are awaiting trial have ended a hunger strike protest in prison, seemingly bringing to an end protests that have taken place for 73 days.In a statement issued by their supporters, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed said they had ended their protests at their respective prisons where they are being detained on remand.The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has not commented on the action over the last two months, but it has not previously disputed accounts from supporters that the hunger strikes were taking place.Four other detainees who - along with Muraisi and Ahmed - began their strikes in early November, ceased their protests last month.All of them have been objecting to the time on remand ahead of trials, which are up to a year away due to the unprecedented court backlogs.The BBC understands that Ahmed was taken to hospital earlier on Wednesday in a very poorly condition.Supporters say the pair have now joined Teuta Hoxha, Jon Cink, Qesser Zuhrah and Amy Gardiner-Gibson, also known as Amu Gib, in receiving medical re-feeding treatment overseen by doctors, as set out in guidelines for the management of hunger strikes in prisons.A seventh detainee who was refusing food every other day due to an underlying health condition has also ended his protest.During the protest the group had made five demands including that the UK government lifts the ban on Palestine Action, closes down an Israeli-owned defence firm and addresses complaints about their prison conditions and treatment.The ban on the organisation was already being considered independently by senior judges. Bail decisions are taken by judges not the government, with ministers having no role in deciding who is remanded ahead of a trial.Shortly before Christmas, lawyers for the hunger strikers had threatened legal action over their treatment.Ministers said neither they, nor MoJ officials, would meet the protesters, but the government offered to facilitate a meeting between the protesters' representatives and medical professionals inside the jails to brief them on the care being offered.The protesters took up that offer two weeks after it was made.The MoJ has vehemently denied clams of medical mistreatment and the Care Quality Commission, a watchdog, has not opened any investigation. It confirmed to the BBC its experts had spoken to medical staff at HMP Bronzefield, one of the prisons where the protest was taking place.There are about 200 hunger strikes a year in prisons and nine people have died as a result of the protests since 1999. Hunger strikes are deemed to be part of the right to protest under human rights law, which means the state no longer has any power to forcibly feed a prisoner, unless doctors conclude they lack the mental capacity to understand the consequences of their actions. If a prisoner understands the risk that they may die and has made their wishes clear, doctors will not give them food, even if it would save their life.",

    "body": "'Appropriate and unambiguous': White House defends Trump over middle-finger gesture at hecklerThe White House has defended US President Donald Trump after he aimed an offensive gesture at a heckler during his appearance at the Ford factory in Detroit on Tuesday.Footage of the incident published by TMZ appears to show Trump responding to a man who shouted at him from afar.The White House said: \"A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.\"The heckler has been suspended by Ford, the United Auto Workers union told the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Within 24 hours of the incident, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from more than 27,000 donors. A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. \"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, identified himself as the man who shouted. He said he had \"no regrets\" about what he did. Sabula reportedly said he his remarks referred to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.United Automotive Workers (UAW), the union that represents Sabula, defended his actions, saying: \"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president.

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it.Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.\"Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting via WANA via ReutersIranian state television has shown this burnt-out bus, saying it was filmed in Tehran on 10 JanuaryMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.  Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers.Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.User generated contentA demonstration outside Hoze Elmiye religious institution, in Najaf Abad, on 8 January\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\".The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.Family of Sorena GolgunSorena Golgun's family say the 18-year-old university student was shot in his heart running from security forces in TonekabonLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryOne young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like \"a war\". The protesters remained \"more united than ever before\" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.\"I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,\" she added.Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris Bell,BBC News Investigations,Joshua Nevett,Political reporterandIain Watson,Political correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesThe families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing say they cannot support the current form of a new law being designed to stop cover-ups.Campaigners met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday in Parliament to press their case that the Hillsborough Law should apply to individual employees of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ and leave no public authority exempt.Last week, families bereaved by the arena attack in 2017 wrote to him saying MI5 had failed them and argued that the proposed law must apply fully to security services.But following their meeting, they said the PM had failed to address their concerns.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the arena attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds.The Hillsborough Law Now campaign has warned that the draft legislation in its current form could allow intelligence chiefs \"to hide serious failures behind a vague claim of national security\".The government has tabled amendments to the draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, that would place the same \"duty of candour\" on security service personnel as other public servants.But MI5, MI6 and GCHQ chiefs would have the power to \"review and determine whether or how\" to provide any information supplied by agents to inquiries or investigations, under the amendments.Government sources said while they had the deepest respect for the families, they had gone as far as they could without compromising national security and that the security services would be subjected to unprecedented scrutiny.A government spokesman told the BBC: \"We have listened to their concerns on how the duty of candour will apply to the security services and we will continue to work with them to make the bill as strong as it can possibly be, while never compromising on national security.\"Ruth Leney, who chairs the Manchester Arena Support Network, said the PM had \"listened\" during their meeting on Wednesday, but added: \"It's not the outcome that we expected.\"It's got to be all or nothing, they can't water down anything, especially with the security services.\"She added: \"We can't trust the bill if not everybody is accountable to it.\"Caroline Curry, whose son Liam Curry, 19, was killed in the bombing, said she was \"devastated\" about amendments to the bill and felt like she had been misled.\"We can't bring our children back, they're gone,\" she said.\"But what we can do is try to stand up for other people and try to protect their children.\"\"It's not what they agreed and what they promised,\" said Lisa Rutherford, whose daughter Chloe Rutherford, 17, was also killed.\"They have said that they will go away and have another look but we are not hopeful,\" she added. \"All we want is honesty.\"\"The government is in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,\" said Pete Weatherby KC, a director of the Hillsborough Law Now campaign which is assisting with the bill.At Prime Minister's Questions, Labour MP Anneliese Midgley accused MI5 of spending \"six years misleading the public and concealing information\" about the arena bombing.In response, Sir Keir said he is determined not to \"water down\" the legislation and argued that the amendments tabled by the government would \"strengthen\" it.\"It is right that there are essential safeguards in place to protect national security, and we've got that balance right,\" Starmer said at PMQs.The bill follows campaigning by families affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that claimed 97 lives.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about that disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.The government has confirmed the remaining stages of the bill will take place next Monday, instead of Wednesday, allowing time for changes to be considered.Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne - a long-standing Hillsborough campaigner - said he plans to press ahead with his own amendment, which would fully apply the law to the security services, unless the government was willing to change its position.He told the BBC it was \"soul-destroying\" that the government appeared to be giving the security services a veto and that families of victims he met had been \"distraught\".About 30 Labour MPs have so far publicly backed Byrne's amendment.",

This will vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis,\" said the tech multi-billionaire.Musk had earlier defended X, posting that critics \"just want to suppress free speech\" along with two AI-generated images of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.In recent days, leaders around the world have criticised Grok's image editing feature.Over the weekend, Malaysia and Indonesia became the first countries to ban the Grok AI tool after users said photos had been altered to create explicit images without consent.Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, said on Monday that it would investigate whether X had failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images.Sir Keir warned X could lose the \"right to self regulate\" amid a backlash over the AI images, but later in the week said he welcomed reports that X was taking action to address the issue.Some UK MPs also left the X social media platform in the wake of the outcry.California Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Wednesday: \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet.\"Policy researcher Riana Pfefferkorn said she is surprised X took so long to deploy the new Grok safeguards and that the editing features should have been removed as soon as the abuse began.Questions remain on how X will enforce its new policies, such as how the AI model will know if an image is of a real person and what actions it will take when users break the rules, said Pfefferkorn.Musk has not presented the company in a serious light either, she said, adding that it would help if he stopped \"doing things like re-posting an AI image of Keir Starmer in a bikini.\"Additional reporting by Katy Bailes",

A Qatari government statement said the measures reportedly being taken by the US were \"in response to the current regional tensions\".The Foreign Office has also temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, which will now operate remotely, a government spokesperson said.The US embassy in Doha has advised its personnel to exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to the Al-Udeid air base.Iran closed its airspace from 02:45 local time (22:15 GMT) on Thursday to almost all flights, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration's website.The closure was initially due to last two hours, but was later extended to 08:00 local time (03:30 GMT), according to the Reuters news agency.Several airlines have announced they will reroute flights around Iran in response, including Air India and Germany's Lufthansa.Air India warned that passengers could experience delays or cancellations as flights through the region were rerouted. Lufthansa issued a statement confirming its flights would avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace \"until further notice\".According to rights groups, more than 2,400 anti-government demonstrators have been killed in the recent violent crackdown by the Iranian authorities.Regarding the removal of military personnel, the Qatari government said it would continue to \"implement all necessary measures to safeguard the security and safety of its citizens and residents as a top priority, including actions related to the protection of critical infrastructure and military facilities\".A UK Ministry of Defence spokesperson declined to comment on reports that UK personnel were being withdrawn \"due to operational security\".Al-Udeid is the largest US military base in the Middle East and about 10,000 personnel are based there, as well as about 100 UK staff. It is not clear how many will be leaving.Earlier this week, Trump warned the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if the authorities execute protesters. Iran has said it will retaliate if attacked by the US.On Wednesday, he said his administration had been told \"on good authority\" that \"the killing in Iran is stopping, and there's no plan for executions\". When questioned by a reporter, Trump said that these were \"very important sources on the other side\" and that he hoped the reports were true. The US president was also asked whether military action was now off the table, to which he replied: \"We're going to watch and see what the process is.\"The Reuters news agency, citing diplomats, reported that while some personnel had been told to leave the Al-Udeid air base, there was no immediate sign of large numbers of troops being bussed out like in the hours before an Iranian strike last year.Speaking to Fox News on Wednesday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned Donald Trump to \"not repeat the same mistake that you did in June,\" adding: \"You know, if you try a failed experience, you will get the same result.\"He also responded to reports of a 26-year-old man whose family say he had been sentenced to death in Iran, saying that \"hanging is out of the question\" and there would be \"no hanging today or tomorrow\".As well as the temporary closure of the British embassy in Tehran, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to \"exercise increased caution and limit non-essential travel to any military installations in the region\".Italy and Poland have published statements urging their citizens to leave Iran, while Germany has issued a notice to air operators recommending that flights do not enter Tehran, citing potential risk from \"escalating conflict and anti-aviation weaponry\".Iran's government has accused the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", with the parliament speaker warning that if the US attacked, both Israeli and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.The latest protests in Iran began at the end of December following the collapse of the currency and as the country deals with soaring living costs. They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, the group also reported.Amnesty International said there were \"mass unlawful killings committed on an unprecedented scale\", citing \"verified videos and credible information from eyewitnesses in Iran\".The organisation urged UN member states to recognise the \"crimes committed by security forces\" in the protests.",

    "body": "Denmark warns of 'fundamental disagreement' after White House talks on Greenland2 hours agoDaniel Bush Washington correspondent, at the White HouseWatch: \"Fundamental disagreement\" with US over Greenland remains, says Danish foreign ministerDenmark's foreign minister has said there is a \"fundamental disagreement\" with the US over Greenland after talks at the White House.Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the meeting with Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday had been \"frank but constructive\". But he added that US President Trump was insisting on \"conquering\" Greenland which was \"totally unacceptable\". \"We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of [Denmark],\" he said.Trump afterwards reiterated his interest in acquiring the resource-rich island, a position that has rattled allies across Europe and stoked tensions with Nato.The hour-long meeting between the US, Denmark and Greenland failed to bring a major breakthrough, although all sides agreed to set-up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the autonomous Danish territory.Rasmussen said there were \"red lines\" the US could not cross, and the working group would meet in the coming weeks in an effort to find a compromise. He added that Denmark and Greenland were open to the possibility of the US opening more military bases on the island.\"It's productive to start discussions at a high level,\" he said.Rasmussen also said there was an \"element of truth\" in Trump's view that security should be bolstered to counter Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. But he said the president's comments about the presence of Russian and Chinese warships  around Greenland were \"not true\".Watch: What message do Greenlanders want to send to Trump?Despite being a sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has repeatedly said acquiring it is vital to US national security. The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip, a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.After the talks on Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greenland Vivian Motzfeldt said the territory was open to greater co-operation with the US but also opposed a takeover.\"We have shown where our limits are,\" Motzfeldt said.Vance and Rubio did not immediately comment after the meeting. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\"\"The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do,\" he said, adding that he does not believe the US can rely on Denmark to defend the island.The talks came as allies in Europe moved quickly to show support for Greenland.Sweden on Wednesday pledged to send armed forces to the territory at Denmark's request. Germany said in a statement provided to the BBC that it would send a \"reconnaissance team\" to Greenland to \"explore the general conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region\".Speaking in Sweden on Wednesday evening, the UK's Defence Secretary John Healey said after a request from Denmark, the UK would be sending one military officer as part of the reconnaissance team. France's foreign minister said the country planned to open a consulate on the island next month.French President Emmanuel Macron said his country would also participate in the reconnaissance team and that \"French military elements\" were already on the way to Greenland. Denmark said its military expansion in Greenland will take place \"in close co-operation with allies\".\"Geopolitical tensions have spread to the arctic,\" it said in a statement.The White House talks were just the latest round of diplomatic discussions over Trump's growing interest in the territory.It is unclear whether the president is considering using military force to seize the island, and he once again declined to rule it out when asked on Wednesday.Other options reportedly under consideration include purchasing the territory - though neither Danes nor Greenlanders have said it is for sale.Since taking office, Vance has criticised Denmark's stewardship of Greenland. The vice president visited soon after taking office.Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome.\"It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,\" Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control.Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation.",

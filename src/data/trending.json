The Trump administration has been defending its seizure of an oil tanker off the Venezuelan coast.  In a dramatic video shared by the US Attorney General, armed camouflaged soldiers are shown swinging down ropes from low flying helicopters, and running along the vessel’s decks. \nThe US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organisations\".  The Venezuela government in response has called the seizure blatant theft, claiming Trump is after the country’s rich oil and energy resources. \nIn this episode, Sarah and Justin unpack how far Donald Trump is willing to go in his ongoing campaign against the Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.   In recent months, the US president has accused Maduro of “forcing” criminals into the US and facilitating drug smuggling, which Maduro denies.  And this week, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has defended the killing of over 80 people in US military strikes on alleged drug boats as the “Al Qaeda of our hemisphere”.  \nThe Americast team also look at how this fits in with other South American countries, with Trump recently offering Honduran ex-president Juan Orlando Hernández a ‘full and complete pardon’.   \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "Man guilty of wife's murder after child reveals plot10 minutes agoPatrick BarlowSouth EastSurrey PoliceRobert Rhodes, 52, has been convicted of murdering his wife, Dawn Rhodes, in a trial at Inner London Crown CourtA man has been found guilty of murdering his wife eight years after being cleared of the crime - after their child gave new evidence.Robert Rhodes stabbed his wife Dawn in the neck but was acquitted of murder in 2017 after claiming she had tried to attack him.The retrial came after new evidence from Rhodes' child – disclosed during therapy – revealed how he coerced them into helping with a plan to kill her and injure himself to make it look like self-defence.Previously, a person could not be retried for the same offence after being cleared, but the double jeopardy law in England Wales changed in 2005 to allow a second trial for the most serious of offences, including murder.Surrey PoliceRobert Rhodes, 52, was arrested again in 2024 Rhodes, 52, who denied ever planning to kill his wife, was also found guilty of child cruelty, perverting the course of justice, and two counts of perjury and will be sentenced in the new year.He was found guilty after 22 hours of deliberations in what Judge Mrs Justice Naomi Ellenbogen called a \"difficult and upsetting case\".The new trial at Inner London Crown Court heard how, days before the attack, Rhodes asked the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to go to Mrs Rhodes and say they had drawn a picture for her.Mrs Rhodes was then told to \"close your eyes and hold out your hands\", at which point the child left the room.Rhodes then stabbed his wife in the neck and killed her in their kitchen at their home near Redhill in Surrey, on 2 June 2016.He came up with the plan after finding out on Christmas Eve, 2015 that Mrs Rhodes had begun an affair with a work colleague.During the original trial, Rhodes, now living in Withleigh in Devon, claimed he had killed his wife in self-defence.He said she \"flipped like the hulk\" during an argument at the home in Wimborne Avenue in Earlswood.'Grieved from the shadows'Paying tribute to their daughter and sister, Mrs Rhodes' mother Liz Spencer and sister Kirsty Spencer said: \"We grieved for Dawn in the shadows with the support of only a few who saw through his [Rhodes'] deceit. \"She was everything to us and he is nothing, she will be celebrated and he will be forgotten.\"Dawn was caring, capable and strong. She would do anything for anyone and was loved by both friends and family.Kirsty added: \"There cannot be justice for Dawn because she is dead. \"The only acknowledgment I make is that for the first time in years, Dawn's voice has finally been heard.\"Dawn's brother Darren added: \"There are no words we can use to make sense of this horrific situation. \"We struggle to comprehend the mindset of an individual so twisted as to even contemplate this as a solution to his own unhappiness, implicating a child under 10 in the process. \"The lack of foresight and disregard not only for his own family but also for the wider, extended family is beyond belief.\"'Groomed and manipulated'Later, Rhodes asked the child to stab him in the back of the shoulder before cutting the child himself on the arm.In police interviews, the pair claimed Mrs Rhodes had swung a knife at the child and attacked her husband.Rhodes claimed he fatally injured his wife while defending himself in the fight that ensued.The child was under 10-years-old at the time, and therefore bears no criminal responsibility for the attack.They revealed the truth of the attacks to their therapist in 2021, who reported this to the police.Surrey Police Det Ch Insp Kimball Edey, told BBC South East: \"Dawn's character was essentially dragged through the mud.\"Dawn Rhodes was a victim of murder and the child is a victim who was groomed and manipulated to do the things they have told us that they did.\"He has shown a high level of malevolence, manipulation, and I would go so far as to say evil.\"'Immense bravery'Double jeopardy rules allow for cases where a person has already been acquitted to be re-tried in exceptional circumstances where new and compelling evidence has come to light.Libby Clark, of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said: \"The new evidence that came from the child witness was profoundly shocking and showed just how much careful planning Robert Rhodes had put into murdering his wife.\"It is thanks to the immense bravery of the child in coming forward to explain exactly what happened that night that Robert Rhodes has finally been brought to justice for the murder of Dawn, something he mistakenly thought he could get away with.\"None of us can even begin to imagine what Rhodes has put the child through over a period of many years. \"Now though, as a result of their evidence, Dawn can now be remembered by everyone in the right way – as a victim of her violent partner.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "George WrightandBethany Bell,BerlinGermany has accused Russia of a cyber-attack on air traffic control and attempted electoral interference, and summoned the Russian ambassador. A foreign ministry spokesman said Russian military intelligence was behind a \"cyber-attack against German air traffic control in August 2024\".The spokesman also accused Russia of seeking to influence and destabilise the country's federal election in February this year. The latest accusations come amid heightened concern in Europe over suspected Russian cyber-attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.There was no immediate response from Russia.The foreign ministry added that Germany - in close co-ordination with its European partners - would respond with counter-measures to make Russia \"pay a price for its hybrid actions\".In the last year, both the UK and Romania have accused Russia of meddling in their domestic affairs, including targeting organisations that deliver foreign assistance to Ukraine and presidential elections.The spokesman said the August 2024 cyber-attack on Germany could be attributed to the Fancy Bear Russian hacker group.\"Our intelligence findings prove that the Russian military intelligence service GRU bears responsibility for this attack,\" he added.The ministry spokesman added it was now certain that Moscow had attempted to  \"influence and destabilise both the last federal election and the ongoing internal affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany\" through a disinformation campaign called Storm 1516.The campaign, it said, had focused in part on lead Green Party candidate Robert Habeck and lead CDU candidate Friedrich Merz, who is now chancellor.The German government said security agencies had identified fake videos alleging ballot manipulation as part of a Russian disinformation effort just days before the election.Its air navigation service provider confirmed that its office communication had been hacked in August 2024. It said flights had not been affected.Fancy Bear is said to have previously leaked World Anti-Doping Agency data, and played a key role in the 2016 cyber-attack on the US Democratic National Committee, according to security experts.Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has led to a major deterioration in relations between Berlin and Moscow.Germany has emerged as one of Ukraine's most vocal supporters, providing military, financial and diplomatic support for Kyiv.Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called strongly for frozen Russian assets to be used to help protect Ukraine.He has also repeatedly accused Russia of cyber warfare against his country.But relations have been strained for years, even before the Russian invasion. In 2019, an ethnic Chechen was killed by a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, in broad daylight in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Germany later expelled two Russian diplomats, as prosecutors suspected that he was acting on the orders of Russia's state security agency.While it is yet to respond to the latest allegations, Moscow has previously denied  European allegations of a Russian sabotage or hybrid campaign.",

The government will not oppose AI regulations around children's safety, he added.The move marks a win for technology giants who have called for US-wide AI legislation as it could have a major impact on America's goal of leading the fast-developing industry.AI company bosses have argued that state-level regulations could slow innovation and hinder the US in its race against China to dominate the industry, as firms pour billions of dollars into the technology.But the move to pre-empt state laws has drawn opposition. While the US currently has no national laws regulating AI, more than 1,000 separate AI bills have been introduced in states across the US, according to the White House. This year alone, 38 states including California, home to many of the world's biggest technology companies, have adopted some 100 AI regulations, the National Conference of State Legislatures says. Those rules range widely. One in California requires platforms to regularly remind users they are interacting with a chatbot, in a bid to protect children and teens from potential harms. The state also passed a bill requiring the largest AI developers to lay out plans to limit potential catastrophic risks stemming from their AI models.In North Dakota, a new law would prevent people from using AI-powered robots to stalk or harass others, while Arkansas bars AI content from infringing on intellectual property rights or existing copyright.Oregon brought in a law prohibiting a \"non-human entity\" including one powered by AI from using licenced medical titles, such as registered nurse. Critics of Trump's executive order have argued that state rules are necessary in the absence of meaningful guardrails at the federal level.\"Stripping states from enacting their own AI safeguards undermines states' basic rights to establish sufficient guardrails to protect their residents,\" said Julie Scelfo, from advocacy group Mothers Against Media Addiction in a statement.California's Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and vocal critic of the president, accused Trump of bowing to the interests of tech allies with the executive order. \"Today, President Trump continued his ongoing grift in the White House, attempting to enrich himself and his associates, with a new executive order seeking to preempt state laws protecting Americans from unregulated AI technology,\" he said. AI firms OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the order. But the move drew praise from tech lobby group NetChoice. \"We look forward to working with the White House and Congress to set nationwide standards and a clear rulebook for innovators,\" said its director of policy Patrick Hedger.Michael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School, said the AI industry was rightly alarmed about having to comply with a patchwork of rules, which might conflict. \"It would be better to have one federal law than a bunch of conflicting state laws,\" he said. But, he added: \"That assumes that we will have a good federal law in place.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoAurelia FosterLondonBBCPrimal Scream lead singer Bobby Gillespie pictured performing at Glastonbury in 2022The Roundhouse music venue has apologised to fans after alleged antisemitic imagery was shown on stage during a Primal Scream concert in north London.Managers of the venue in Camden said they \"deeply regret\" that the \"highly offensive\" graphics were displayed, adding that it was done entirely without their knowledge.The rock band from Glasgow was reported to the police by the Community Security Trust (CST) after a video was screened on stage on Monday evening that appeared to show the Star of David entwined with a swastika.In a post on Instagram on Friday, Primal Scream said the film was \"a piece of art\" although it did not state whether the post referred specifically to the same video.The BBC has contacted Primal Scream for further comment.The Met Police said it was contacted after the group performed their 2000 song Swastika Eyes during the one-off gig.As they played, pictures of political figures appeared in the backdrop.An image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to show the Star of David combined with a swastika in his eyes.The slogans \"stop genocide\" and \"free Palestine\" were shown on a large screen as well as the words \"our government is complicit\".A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said the video was \"being assessed by officers\" to determine whether an offence had been committed. 'Against our values'In a statement, a spokesperson for Roundhouse said they were \"appalled\" by the display.\"We deeply regret that these highly offensive images were presented on our stage and unequivocally apologise to anyone who attended the gig, and to the wider Jewish community.\"The content, which was used entirely without our knowledge, stands against all of our values.\"The spokesperson went on to say the Roundhouse \"condemns antisemitism in every form\".\"Acts of hatred, discrimination or prejudice of any kind are entirely unacceptable and have no place in our community or spaces.\"We stand in solidarity with the Jewish community and remain committed to ensuring that our spaces are places where everyone feels secure, respected and valued.\"Getty ImagesThe Roundhouse has been hosting live music since the 1960sPrimal Scream, founded by frontman Bobby Gillespie in 1982, were performing a 25-year anniversary show for their album XTRMNTR.The band's Instagram post went on to say that an unspecified video \"draws on history\" to question the actions of current world governments.\"It is meant to provide debate, not hate.\"In a free, pluralistic and liberal society, freedom of expression is a right which we choose to exercise.\"The Community Security Trust (CST), which provides protection for Jewish communities in the UK, said it had reported the group to police and called on the venue to carry out an \"urgent investigation\".In a statement, a CST spokesperson said: \"Entwining a Star of David with a swastika implies that Jews are Nazis and risks encouraging hatred of Jews.\"The CST added someone at the gig contacted them to complain and had also sent them video footage of the images shown on stage.'Unadulterated hatred'The charity Campaign Against Antisemitism said: \"The Nazi swastika represents the ideology that inspired people to industrially slaughter six million innocent Jewish men, women and children by bullet, gas and any other means available.\"To visually combine that with the Star of David - the pre-eminent symbol of Judaism - is absolutely sickening and totally inexcusable.\"The group said it believed the images were neither art or a political statement but \"unadulterated hatred\" and said its legal team was examining the footage to consider further steps.A Met Police spokesperson said: \"On Wednesday, 10 December we received a report in relation to a video shown on stage during a concert at the Roundhouse in Chalk Farm Road, Camden on Monday, 8 December. It is being assessed by officers.\"Related internet links",

The battalion's senior operator assessed his handling as \"good\", adding that the future king \"could be trained up\".Andrew Parsons/Kensington PalacePrince William's connection with the regiment dates back decadesPrior to that he and the Princess of Wales - who now occupies her husband's former role as Colonel of the Irish Guards - attended the regiment's St David's Day procession in March 2023.After making speeches, the royal couple took part in the annual tradition of presenting handmade leeks to officers and soldiers to wear on their chests.The 1st Battalion has featured heavily in a number of ceremonial events over the years, including Queen Elizabeth's funeral and the King's 2023 coronation.They have also been the subject of several BBC documentaries and reports, including the BAFTA Cymru award-winning film Helmand: Tour of Duty in 2024.More top storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatandChristine Nababan,BBC Indonesia, BaliMembers of the media shouted questions as Bonnie Blue arrived for her hearingAdult content creator Tia Billinger, better known as Bonnie Blue, will be deported from Indonesia after being cleared of breaking the country's strict anti-pornography laws.She was found guilty of a minor traffic offence, but was deported for an immigration violation due to working on a tourist visa.The 26-year-old was one of 34 people detained when police raided a production studio in Bali, prompting a police investigation.Bali - which is predominantly Hindu and visited by millions of tourists every year - is part of Muslim-majority Indonesia, which strictly forbids the production of pornographic material.Those found guilty of violating these laws face up to 12 years in prison and a fine of around $360,000 (£270,000).Ms Billinger was ordered to pay a fine of Rp 200,000 (about $12/£9) and will leave Indonesia on a flight set to depart just after midnight local time.Immigration officials said they would issue a statement on whether their request to blacklist the social media star, preventing her from re-entering the country, had been put into effect.Earlier this week, Badung Police reported that 16 foreign and 14 Indonesian witnesses said they had been in a studio in the Pererenan area, Mengwi, to take part in the production of an \"entertainment-themed reality show\", but they claimed \"no indecent material was produced\".Ms Billinger was among four other individuals who were identified as having \"dominant roles\" in the production.Badung police also said investigators looked into the purchase of a pickup truck which had \"Bonnie Blue\" and \"Bang Bus\" branded on it. Police said the four individuals confirmed they were aware of Indonesia's ban on producing pornographic content.Investigators also looked at videos recorded at a hotel in the Berawa area of the country, but \"found no elements of pornography or any unlawful distribution\".However, the four foreign nationals are suspected of \"misusing their stay permits\" to work on commercial content.Badung police chief M Arif Batubara said they are ensuring \"all processes are carried out based on legal facts\" and are working with prosecutors and immigration authorities to \"determine the next legal steps\".Ms Billinger is known to film controversial videos which have seen her tour universities looking for \"barely legal\" teenagers in a bus with the same name.The content creator, originally from Nottingham, had been driving around Bali during \"schoolies week\", which is a tradition in Australia where high school graduates go on a holiday after their exams.Last year, she had planned to produce pornography involving young adults but her Australian tourist visa was cancelled.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesBest-selling author Joanna Trollope has died aged 82, her family has announced.The writer was known as the \"queen of the Aga saga\" because her novels often focused on romance and intrigue in middle England, although she rejected the tag as \"patronising\".In a statement, her daughters Louise and Antonia said their \"beloved and inspirational mother\" had died \"peacefully at her Oxfordshire home\" on Thursday.Trollope's novels include The Rector's Wife, Marrying The Mistress, Second Honeymoon and Daughters in Law.Trollope's literary agent James Gill said in a statement: It is with great sadness that we learn of the passing of Joanna Trollope, one of our most cherished, acclaimed and widely enjoyed novelists. \"Joanna will be mourned by her children, grandchildren, family, her countless friends and - of course - her readers.\"Trollope's books have been translated into more than 25 languages, and several have been adapted for television.Joanna Prior, CEO of publisher Pan Macmillan, described Trollope as a \"treasured author\" who was \"much admired for her astute judgement, sharp wit, fun company and steely determination\".Getty ImagesTrollope was made a CBE in 2019 for services to literatureTrollope was a writer for more than five decades, and one of the best known novelists in the UK.She authored more than 20 contemporary novels including 2013's Sense & Sensibility, the lead title in HarperCollins's Austen Project.The author also wrote 10 historical novels, which were published under the pseudonym Caroline Harvey. Trollope occasionally wrote short stories and pieces for magazines, chaired book prizes, authored a 2006 study of women in the British Empire called Britannia's Daughters, and edited a 1993 anthology of rural life called The Country Habit.She received an OBE in 1996 for services to charity, and was made a CBE in 2019 for services to literature. Trollope was born in Gloucestershire, a fifth-generation niece of the English novelist Anthony Trollope.\"I'm not a direct descendant of his, although I'm from the same family, but another branch of it,\" she once told the Independent. \"I admire him hugely, and take several things he said about writing very much to heart.\"She read English at Oxford University and worked in the Foreign Office and as a teacher before becoming a full-time author in 1980.Her early novels were all written under her pseudonym until the release of her first contemporary novel, the Choir, in 1987. Several of her later novels were adapted for the screen, including A Village Affair, The Choir, Other People's Children and The Rector's Wife. She told the Writers Write website that she preferred to use pen and paper to write her novels. \"I love the silence and intimacy and simplicity. I can also, when it's going really well, write like the wind - 1,000 words an hour,\" she said.But the process of writing was \"extremely hard\".\"But then, I think anything worthwhile is inevitably going to be hard,\" she added. \"The most exciting moment for me is the penultimate chapter - the end is in sight, and clear, but the activity of the race isn't quite yet over.\"PA MediaTrollope pictured meeting Queen Elizabeth II in 2001The description of her books as \"Aga sagas\" caught on, despite only two of Trollope's novels actually featuring an Aga.She later admitted she was \"fairly tired of such an inaccurate and patronising tag\", describing it as a \"very unfortunate phrase\" that had \"done me a lot of damage\".The \"Aga saga\" tag is thought to have come from novelist Terence Blacker, but Trollope said: \"People who are rude about them don't take into account the amount of research I do, which is swotty and immense.\"The name itself indicates a provincial cosiness, and is patronising of the readers. A lot of what I write into the books is bleak and challenging but I will be the Queen of the Aga saga to my dying day. It's jolly annoying, but it is better than being the Queen of Hearts.\"Trollope's work tackled a range of topics from affairs, blended families and adoption, to parenting and marital breakdown.She also often wrote about remarriage, parenthood and the strains on the so-called \"sandwich generation\", caring for both their children and their parents.In The Soldier's Wife, she portrayed families struggling to cope with the aftermath of a harrowing Afghanistan tour.Fellow novelist Fay Weldon once said Trollope had \"a gift for putting her finger on the problem of the times\".Trollope said it was \"a great honour and an even bigger challenge\" to rework Austen's Sense & Sensibility in 2013.But she had previously said that comparisons of her own work with Austen's \"make me fidget\".\"There is a huge gulf between being great and being good. I know exactly which category I fall into and which she falls into,\" she told the Independent.\"On a good day, I might be good. I think of my writing as contemporary accessible fiction and it really isn't for me to add the qualifying adjectives.\"In a 1994 episode of Desert Island Discs, she again addressed criticisms that her books were trivial, responding: \"It is a grave mistake to think there is more significance in great things than in little things.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior technology reporterA union representing workers in the creative industries says there is \"real concern\" among its members about a $1bn (£740m) deal which will see Disney characters brought to ChatGPT and video-generation tool Sora.It is the first major studio to license parts of its catalogue to OpenAI, which makes the tools.Fans will be able to generate and share pictures and videos of more than 200 characters from Disney's franchises, including Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.\"Everyone in the entertainment industry, especially all the creative talent, are incredibly worried about what the implications are,\" said Sag-Aftra executive director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.He said the two companies had contacted the union -  which represents 170,000 media professionals worldwide - to say the agreement specifically rules out the use of the image, likeness or voice of human performers.But he said it was still a worrying development.\"There's real concern because nobody wants to see human creativity given away to AI models,\" he told BBC News.The move comes as OpenAI faces mounting questions about how its rapidly advancing tech is used - and as anxiety in Hollywood increases over the impact of AI on the creative industries. According to a blog post announcing the news, the list of eligible characters include those from Disney films Zootopia, Moana and Encanto - as well as characters like Star Wars' Luke Skywalker and Marvel's Deadpool.It, of course, also includes Mickey and Minnie Mouse.But quite how the characters will sound remains unclear, as Disney said the agreement \"does not include any talent likenesses or voices\".\"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry,\" Disney boss Bob Iger said.\"Through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling.\"People are expected to be able to begin making the videos and images in Sora and ChatGPT in early 2026.The deal comes amid reports Disney lawyers sent Google a cease-and-desist letter on Wednesday accusing the tech firm of infringing its copyrights \"on a massive scale\".The BBC has asked Google for a response.Joel Smith, intellectual property partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said Disney's OpenAI deal showed \"rights owners and major AI developers are moving fast to strike collaborative licensing deals to access content for training and future use\".Equity, the entertainment trade union, says actors' rights need to be protected. The group is currently balloting thousands of performers asking if they are willing to refuse being digitally scanned on set to push for stronger AI safeguards.Cathy Sweet, Equity's head of TV and Film, said the deal between Disney and OpenAI reinforced \"exactly why our members are fighting for AI protections\".\"The recorded material that will be sold on as part of this eye-watering big money deal are the result of creatives' professional work, and their rights must be protected,\" she said.Sora's hyper-realistic videos have proven to be popular in the US, but there have been significant criticisms from those claiming it has also led to some people creating offensive deepfakes of dead public figures.In October, OpenAI paused the video tool's ability to generate images of Dr Martin Luther King Jr after the app produced \"disrespectful\" depictions of the civil rights leader. The firm acknowledged the need for stronger safeguards after clips emerged showing him saying offensive things, prompting a public outcry.Other similar videos of President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II and physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking also circulated widely. In some cases, family members called on OpenAI to stop allowing videos to be made.Zelda Williams, daughter of the late comedian Robin Williams, urged people to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her father.In November, Warner Music Group announced plans to launch an AI music venture with technology start-up Suno, a year after it sued the firm in a landmark case.",

UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were \"a scar on the conscience of the world\" which \"cannot, and will not, go unpunished.\"The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell. He is the brother of RSF chief Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo.Sudan's civil war - sparked after the RSF and the military's fragile ruling coalition collapsed - has now raged for more than two years, killing hundreds of thousands of people and displacing millions more.El-Fasher was the army's last major stronghold in Darfur, the traditional stronghold of the RSF paramilitary.An investigation by BBC Verify revealed the brutal tactics used by the RSF during the protracted siege, which included detaining and torturing people trying to smuggle supplies into the city and building a massive sand barrier around it to prevent civilians and army troops from escaping.In its statement announcing the sanctions, the UK foreign office said it believed that Abu Lulu was \"responsible for violence against individuals based on ethnicity and religion, and the deliberate targeting of civilians\".Footage confirmed by BBC Verify in October showed Abu Lulu executing several unarmed captives with an AK-style rifle in a sandy, dusty area north-west of the city. RSF troops who witnessed the incidents were later seen celebrating their commander's actions.UK officials accused Abu Lulu, Dagalo, Gedo Hamdan Ahmed and Tijani Ibrahim Moussa Mohamed of carrying out \"heinous\" acts of violence, including mass killings, systematic sexual violence and deliberate attacks on civilians. The men have been placed under travel bans and any assets they hold will be frozen.\"Today's sanctions against RSF commanders strike directly at those with blood on their hands, while our strengthened aid package will deliver lifesaving support to those suffering,\" Cooper said.Citing satellite images - previously published by Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab - the foreign office said piles of bodies and mass graves could be seen in el-Fasher after the massacre.Cooper also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas.In the days that followed the el-Fasher massacre, RSF leader Gen Mohamed \"Hemedti\" Dagalo admitted that his troops had committed \"violations\" and said the incidents would be investigated.Among those arrested was Abu Lulu. In a carefully choreographed and edited video posted on the RSF's official Telegram account he is shown being led into a cell at a prison, which was geolocated by BBC Verify to the outskirts of el-Fasher.The commander, who previously featured heavily in propaganda videos posted online, has not been seen since his arrest. A TikTok account that documented his activities was removed by the company in October after BBC Verify approached the tech giant for comment.The UK's move comes just two days after the US announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals it accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers and training individuals to fight in Sudan's civil war.The US Treasury Department said that hundreds of Colombian mercenaries have travelled to Sudan since 2024, including to serve as infantry and drone pilots for the RSF.Last month, US President Donald Trump pledged to \"start working on Sudan\" alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, posting on social media that \"tremendous atrocities\" were taking place.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentBango Studios/PAKing Charles has recorded a personal message about his experience of cancer, which will be broadcast in this year's Stand Up To Cancer campaign, run by Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.Buckingham Palace said the King would talk about his \"recovery journey\" as a cancer patient, in a video message on Friday at 20:00 GMT.The message, recorded at Clarence House two weeks ago, will emphasise the importance of cancer screening checks to ensure more people catch the disease at an early stage.This will be a rare update on the health of King, who has been undergoing regular treatment since revealing his diagnosis in February 2024. But it is thought unlikely the King will identify his type of cancer.The Stand Up To Cancer campaign each year raises funds for medical research and treatment and encourages people to get check-ups to increase the chances of an early diagnosis.The King's relative openness about his illness, and living with cancer, has been intended to raise awareness and to get more people to get tested - and this will be taken a step further with this unusual personal contribution.So far the King's main approach to his cancer has been to keep working, maintaining a busy schedule despite his regular rounds of treatment, and he seems not to have wanted to be defined by his illness.This year has seen the King, 77, taking several overseas trips, including to Italy and Canada, and hosting the biggest number of inward state visits to the UK for almost 40 years, including the German president last week.Before the announcement of this special broadcast, the King earlier this week enjoyed an atmospheric and meditative Advent service in Westminster Abbey, with a message from the King highlighting that this was a season of optimism and \"hope\".PA MediaKing Charles hosted the German state visit at Windsor Castle last weekFriday evening's Stand Up to Cancer show on Channel 4, presented by celebrities including Davina McCall, Adam Hills and Clare Balding, will urge people not to be frightened of getting cancer checks.All three have been affected by cancer - McCall said last month she had undergone surgery for breast cancer, while Balding was treated for thyroid cancer more than 15 years ago. Comedian Hills has previously spoken about his late father, who had stomach cancer and then later leukaemia.The show will appeal to the estimated nine million people in the UK who Cancer Research UK says are not up to date with NHS screening schemes, with an online checker to let people see if they are eligible for tests for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.In an attempt to demystify cancer checks and show the value of early diagnosis there will be a live broadcast from cancer clinics at Addenbrooke's and Royal Papworth hospitals in Cambridge.\"I want to take the fear out of cancer screening and show everyone that they are not on their own in this,\" said Davina McCall.Davina McCall will be presenting Channel 4's Stand Up To Cancer showCurrently in the UK, there are three NHS cancer screening programmes - for bowel, breast and cervical cancer - available to certain age groups.A new lung cancer screening programme is also being slowly rolled out for anyone at high risk of developing the disease, specifically targeting people aged 55-74 years old, who currently smoke or used to.Men may enquire about prostate cancer checks, but there is no national programme in place.The Stand Up to Cancer project, which has raised £113m since 2012, is funding 73 clinical trials involving 13,000 patients.King Charles, in a message for guests at a reception for cancer charities in April, had spoken of recognising the \"daunting and at times frightening experience\" for cancer sufferers and their loved ones.But he said his experience of living with cancer had shown him that \"the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion,\" as he praised those who cared for cancer patients.The Palace has not revealed what kind of cancer the King has, or what treatment he has received. The King's cancer was discovered after he had undergone a prostate procedure.",

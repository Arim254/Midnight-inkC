    "body": "2 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorReutersAt just after half past nine on Wednesday night, the documents appeared on the government's website.There were three submissions from one of the government's Deputy National Security Advisers, Matthew Collins.The first one from December 2023, under the Conservatives.And two more. The second one is dated February 2024, also when the Conservatives were in power and the third August 2025, when Labour were.But it turns out, we learned in a later hastily published clarification, the date was a year out in that second document and it was actually submitted in February 2025, under Labour – arguably a crucial distinction when one element of the language used is examined.Firstly, then, to the first document.It includes lots of detail relating to the specific allegations against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, who have always denied the allegations against them and who are not facing any criminal proceedings.Mr Cash, through his solicitor, has already put out a statement reiterating his innocence and reflecting that he hadn't had \"the daylight of a public trial\" and adding that he shouldn't have to take part \"in a trial by media.\"In the first document, Mr Collins sets out that the government at the time saw China as an \"evolving and epoch defining challenge\". That was the language government ministers were always careful to use at the time.It adds that the government \"will increase our national security protections where Chinese state actions pose a threat to our people, prosperity and security\".There is then a segment that is a little warmer towards Beijing: \"We will engage directly with China bilaterally and in international fora so that we leave room for open, constructive and predictable relations.\"But it is blunt, too: \"The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interests.\"He concludes: \"It is my assessment that the suspects' alleged activities were prejudicial to the safety or interests of the UK, and the information and material passed would be directly or indirectly useful to the Chinese state.\"So, he talks about espionage, he talks about threats and he talks too about being open and constructive.Government publishes key witness statements in collapsed China spy caseThe controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedBadenoch demands PM address 'unanswered' China spy case questionsFast forward to February of this year and the language is similar, but it does appear to reflect the change in government and its outlook on relations with China.Mr Collins says China presents \"the biggest state based threat to the UK's economic security\" but adds a few paragraphs later \"it is important for me to emphasise, however, that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China. The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised.\"That word \"positive\" hadn't featured in the earlier document.And then in the final submission, from just a few months ago in August of this year, the word \"positive\" features again, but so does this:\"China's espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience and the integrity of our democratic institutions.\"And, crucially, he points out that between 2021 and 2023, the crucial years under the last government when these allegations relate to, \"the UK government publicly articulated…the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\".The BBC understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue, when he submitted that third and final witness statement.We are also told that after submitting his first statement, when the Crown Prosecution Service went back to him to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, they were not explicitly clear what Mr Collins would have needed to say in order to clear that threshold.So what can we deduce from all of this?This government and its Conservative predecessor had a deep and ongoing worry about Chinese espionage. But both also wanted an economic and diplomatic relationship with Beijing.Labour folk tell me it justifies the prime minister's argument – as punchy a case as could be made was made, within the confines of government policy a few years ago and now.Some Conservative folk note Mr Collins' language in the submissions since the general election quotes language that featured in Labour's manifesto: \"We will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to and challenge where we must.\"The Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp told me: \"This is wholly contrary to what the prime minister has been saying – which is that all of the evidence submitted related to the 2021-2023 period.\"We await Downing Street's response.And one final thing.There are MPs digesting all of this who are struggling to understand why this case didn't come to court.It is the Crown Prosecution Service's role to judge the likelihood of securing a conviction and in this instance they didn't think that likelihood was high enough – and it is their job to determine that.But there is enough in these documents to ensure that element of this debate continues, as well as the approach taken by both the previous government and by this one.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporter andJoshua NevettPolitical reporterAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaSir Keir Starmer is facing further questions over the China spying case after witness statements said the country was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" against the UK.The PM ordered the publication of the three statements, by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, in a bid to clear up a row about why the case against two alleged spies collapsed.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case after deciding the evidence did not show China was a threat to the UK's national security.But the statements are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK, raising questions for the CPS and ministers about why the prosecutions did not go ahead.The Conservatives have accused the government of allowing the case to collapse to avoid jeopardising economic relations with China.This is firmly denied by the government, who blame the previous Conservative administration who were in charge when Mr Collins sent his first evidence statement, for the collapse of the prosecution.The head of the CPS Stephen Parkinson is also in the firing line, with MPs suggesting there was sufficient evidence to put the case before a jury.He is reported to have told senior MPs on Wednesday that the evidence was \"5%\" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction.In the first witness statement, sent in December 2023, Mr Collins outlines the case against  former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33.The pair are accused of collaborating with a Chinese Communist Party leader who was deputy director of the Central National Security Commission, chaired by President Xi Jinping.In one message, Mr Cash is alleged to have told Mr Berry: \"You're in spy territory now.\" Both men deny any wrongdoing.In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he had been placed in an \"impossible situation\" because he had not \"had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence\". He added: \"I should not have to take part in a trial by media.\"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"While Mr Berry has previously denied spying for China, he has not commented since the day the case ended.MPs are poring over the three witness statement released on Wednesday night - a highly unusual move sanctioned by the CPS.The second witness statement, written by Mr Collins in February 2025, after Labour had taken power, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\".A third witness statement published in August this year restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the two statements submitted under Labour made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\".ReutersSir Keir said he would publish the statements after Kemi Badenoch accused him of a \"cover-up\"Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, said Mr Collins's third statement includes language about China similar to that in Labour's election manifesto last year.The witness statement and the manifesto both include the words \"we will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must\".\"There's a direct lift from the Labour Party manifesto,\" Kearns said. \"It's very hard to believe there was no political interference and that a civil servant would have felt the need to do that.\"But she said there been \"misleading discussion\" about whether China was deemed a threat to national security at the time of the alleged offences in 2023.\"In my view, the Crown Prosecution Service should have proceeded with this,\" Kearns said.She added: \"The case law shows it's for a jury to decide if China is or could be a threat to our country.\"BBC News understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Mr Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.House of CommonsSir Keir Starmer committed to urgently publishing the documents in the Commons on WednesdayMr Cash and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Speaking to the BBC's World Tonight, the former Conservative Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he found the collapse of the case \"utterly mystifying\".He acknowledged the words \"threat to our national security\" were not used, but added: \"When you read the totality of these statements, you can be left in absolutely no doubt that China was a threat to our national security.\"",

    "body": "Australia's tropical rainforests have become the first in the world to release more carbon than they absorb, in a trend linked to climate change, a study has found. Rainforests are usually regarded as so-called \"carbon sinks\" as they absorb more emissions than they emit with new trees offsetting the carbon released by dead ones.But a study looking at data from Queensland forests found that extreme temperatures have caused more tree deaths than growths.The lead author of the study, which was published in science journal Nature, said the findings have significant implications for global emissions reduction targets which are partly based on how ecosystems - such as rainforests - can absorb carbon.\"Current models may overestimate the capacity of tropical forests to help offset fossil fuel emissions,\" said Dr Hannah Carle of the Western Sydney University.With fewer new trees, the report found that the trunks and branches of dead trees - known as woody biomass - became carbon emitters, rather than carbon absorbers, about 25 years ago.\"Forests help to curb the worst effects of climate change by absorbing some of the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels, but our work shows this is under threat,\" said Dr Carle.Dr Carle added that said an increase in trees dying in recent decades was due to climate change such as more extreme temperatures, atmospheric dryness and drought.Based on 49 years of data from 20 forests in Queensland, the report also found a rise in the number of cyclones and the severity of them was killing more trees and making it harder for new ones to grow. \"We have in this study evidence that Australia's moist tropical forests are the first of their kind globally to to exhibit this [woody biomass] change,\" Dr Carle said. \"And that's really significant. It could be a sort of canary in the coal mine.\"Senior author Patrick Meir also described the results as \"very concerning\", telling news agency AFP that it was \"likely that all tropical forests [would] respond fairly similarly\" - but added that more data and research would be needed to make a fair assessment. Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, recently announced its new carbon reduction targets, pledging to cut emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade.The country continues to face global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels, with the government allowing one of the country's largest gas projects -Woodside's North West Shelf - to keep operating for another 40 years.Last month, a new report into the impact of climate change found Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from \"cascading, compounding and concurrent\" climate risks.",

    "body": "The Cabinet Office has rejected Dominic Cummings' claim that China breached high-level systems used to transfer sensitive government information.In an interview with the Times, Cummings said China obtained \"vast amounts\" of \"extremely secret\" information from the UK intelligence services and parts of Whitehall.He told the paper the breach was covered up after he was briefed on the compromised data in 2020 while a senior aide to then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson.In response, a Cabinet Office spokesperson said: \"It is untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised.\"Cummings said China breached high-level systems used to transfer so-called Strap material, a government classification for highly sensitive intelligence data.In the interview, he said the compromised information included: \"Material from intelligence services. Material from the National Security Secretariat in the Cabinet Office. \"Things the government has to keep secret. If they're not secret, then there are very, very serious implications for it.\"He told the newspaper: \"The cabinet secretary said, 'We have to explain something; there's been a serious problem', and he talked through what this was.\"And it was so bizarre that, not just Boris, a few people in the room were looking around like this - 'Am I somehow misunderstanding what he's saying?'\"He added: \"What I'm saying is that some Strap stuff was compromised and vast amounts of data classified as extremely secret and extremely dangerous for any foreign entity to control was compromised.\"Cummings also claimed the breach was covered up.\"If the MPs want to finally have an inquiry about it, I'd be happy to talk about it,\" he said.A former government security official told the BBC he was \"mystified\" by Cummings' claims.Professor Ciaran Martin became the first chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre in 2016 and stood down in August 2020.Speaking on Radio 4's The World Tonight programme, Prof Martin cast doubt on Cummings' claim that the so-called Strap system was breached.\"This is, to the best of my knowledge, categorically untrue,\" he said. \"That would have fallen to the National Cyber Security Centre to lead and there was no such investigation.\"Prof Martin added: \"China is a consistent and serious cyber security threat… but these systems are entirely different. \"They're built, monitored, secured and operated in an entirely different way than normal internet-based systems. \"It doesn't follow that… they [China] can somehow penetrate these entirely bespoke systems and there wasn't any evidence in 2020 that they did so.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporter Fewer than half of BBC viewers who responded to a major questionnaire sent out by the broadcaster think the corporation is effective at being independent from the government.More than 870,000 members of the public answered questions online about the BBC and its place in society.While 91% of respondents said it was important for the BBC to be independent from the government of the day, only 43% said they thought it was succeeding effectively in practice. A further 38% said they thought it was ineffective.BBC director general Tim Davie said the results showed \"our audience wants an independent BBC, delivering high-quality programmes and content that they can trust\".The BBC invited audience members to have their say in a series of on-air promotions across TV and radio. It also sent emails to 40 million BBC account holders.The results of the Our BBC, Our Future questionnaire come after the relationship between the BBC and the government has been in the spotlight.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy appeared to call for Mr Davie's resignation this summer after a string of scandals, including antisemitic comments by punk duo Bob Vylan at Glastonbury being broadcast on iPlayer, and the revelation that a Gaza documentary was narrated by the son of a Hamas official.In August, former BBC director of news James Harding told the Edinburgh TV Festival that Nandy's involvement in the Bob Vylan scandal was \"chilling\", and criticised \"political interference\", or the perception of it, at the BBC.Last year, BBC chair Samir Shah said there was \"an almost perpetual government review over the BBC\" as a result of the requirement for ministers to renew the broadcaster's royal charter every 10 years.Meanwhile, questions about the BBC's independence were raised when former Tory donor and Rishi Sunak's ex-boss Richard Sharp was named BBC chair in 2021. Mr Sharp resigned two years later over his links to Boris Johnson.Also in 2021, Theresa May's former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb was appointed to the BBC board.One other major gap identified by the questionnaire results was the percentage of respondents who felt the BBC should reflect different parts of the UK and the people who live there (76%), and the percentage who felt it actually did (51%).\"These are gaps that will need to be worked on and addressed as a priority as the BBC's future is debated and we plan how to serve the public better,\" the BBC said.The questionnaire also found:80% of respondents said it was important for the corporation to offer high-quality digital services, while 78% said the BBC should offer something for everyone82% said it was important to provide a valuable public service, while 76% said it should be an asset for the UK around the world83% said it was important that the BBC continued its mission to inform, educate and entertain78% of respondents said the BBC should offer something for everyone, but only 59% said it was effective at doing soIn his statement, Mr Davie described the response to the questionnaire as \"incredible\", which he said \"shows just how much people care about the BBC\".\"I strongly believe the BBC has never been more needed, both in the UK and around the world,\" he said.\"The results of the questionnaire are clear – our audience wants an independent BBC, delivering high-quality programmes and content that they can trust; that tells the stories that matter to them and that reflect their lives.\"Mr Davie thanked those who took part, adding: \"We are here to deliver for audiences across the UK and we will be taking everything they have told us with us as we shape the future of the BBC.\"",

    "body": "OceanGate's Titan submersible imploded on its journey to the wreck of the Titantic because of poor engineering and multiple failures to test the vessel, according to an official report.Titan imploded in June 2023, killing all five passengers on board including OceanGate's chief executive.The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the engineering process behind the vehicle was \"inadequate\", resulting in faults which meant it failed to meet strength and durability requirements.The NTSB said because the firm did not adequately test Titan it did not know its actual strength. It was also unaware it was damaged and should have been removed from service before its last voyage.Titan disappeared in the North Atlantic as it attempted to dive to the wreck of Titanic which lies some 372 miles from St. John's in Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada.In August, the US Coast Guard released a damning report into the implosion which found that the incident was \"preventable\" and criticised OceanGate's \"critically flawed\" safety practices.Stockton Rush, OceanGate's chief executive, operated the Titan on its final journey.The passengers, who paid up to $250,000 each to take part in the dive, deep-sea explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood and Hamish Harding.During its investigation, the NTSB discovered issues with the safety culture at OceanGate.While some employees said safety was a priority, others, including a former director of marine operations and a technician, highlighted an environment \"where safety issues, particularly design issues, were ignored\".One technician at the firm said he had concerns about OceanGate's business model, in particular accepting paying clients as \"mission specialists\" as opposed to passengers.Under US regulations, it is illegal to transport passengers in an experimental submersible.The technician told the NTSB that he informed Mr Rush: \"… you can't just change the title of a person when you're receiving compensation.\" In a later conversation on the same subject, the technician recounted that Mr Rush said: \"If the [US] Coast Guard became a problem … he would buy himself a congressman and make it go away\".",

It's nerves, but I always own up,\" responded Imrie, sparking howls of laughter.Winkleman then had to tell the celebrities to settle down, before they launched into another tough challenge.Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark sideFans online were left in hysterics, with one X user calling it \"the TV highlight of the year\", while another said we'd \"peaked as a nation\".\"Critically acclaimed thespian Celia Imrie farts like the rest of us folks,\" noted showbiz reporter Catrina Rose.But the latest episode wasn't all fun and games.Before long, two of the younger celebrities had been forced to leave the show.BBC/Studio LambertSome fans raised concerns that Niko Omilana was banished because he was an \"outsider\"First up, Youtube star Niko Omilana, who was thought to be a Traitor by celebrities including actor Sir Stephen Fry.After his banishment, the 27-year-old revealed that he had, in fact, always been a faithful.His departure sparked a backlash online by some fans, who were unhappy to see him go.\"They've all been cowards there,\" wrote one X user, adding: \"Niko has been voted because he's an outsider and he's not in their celebrity world. Nothing to do with the game.\"In a TikTok video posted later, Omilana seemed to address the speculation by showing him being shunned and spat on by groups of friends.He captioned it: \"POV: You try and make friends in the Traitors.\"\"Niko being eliminated has sent shockwaves through social media,\" said entertainment journalist Indigo Stafford.\"For many viewers, his elimination came out of nowhere. And now a new theory is spreading online about the real reason Niko was voted out... which is that the other contestants didn't know him well,\" she said.\"Since many of the celebs tend to move in the same circles, some fans are convinced that him being an outsider is what unnerved them.\"Who are the two big dogs on Celebrity Traitors?The episode also saw Olympic diver Tom Daley, 31, murdered by the traitors.He said he was \"gutted\", but TV presenter Jonathan Ross - a traitor - quipped, \"gold medals don't count as shields do they\".Wednesday's action-packed episode concluded with actress and comedian Tameka Empson being banished at the roundtable, following suspicions that she too could be a traitor (spoiler - she wasn't).'Tom's been murdered. Deal with it'Elsewhere, the third episode marked a shift in character for comedian - and Traitor - Alan Carr.Gone was the nervously giggling Carr, who we were all a bit worried for. Instead, he seemed to be embracing being a Traitor.In the turret, when plotting over who to murder next, he quipped: \"I've got a taste for it now,\" following his earlier murder of singer Paloma Faith.Later on, at breakfast, he appeared to roll his eyes at the other celebrities' reactions to Tom Daley's death.\"People couldn't believe it, 'Where's Tom? Why Tom?' Well he's been murdered. Deal with it.\"\"Alan has happily become a killing machine,\" observed Rose.Once again, fans were left with a cliffhanger, as the Traitors weighed up whether to murder actress Ruth Codd, singer Charlotte Church, or historian David Olusoga.But the episode ended on a lighter note, as Carr admitted to Imrie why he'd voted for her to be banished.\"Can I be honest with you?,\" he said. \"It was that fart in the hut.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.More on The Celebrity Traitors",

    "body": "50 minutes agoNick Edserbusiness reporterThe UK economy grew slightly in August helped by an increase in manufacturing output, according to the latest official figures.The economy expanded by 0.1%, the Office for National Statistics said, after contracting by 0.1% in July.The government has made boosting the economy a key priority and pressure is mounting ahead of the Budget next month, but economists expect growth to remain sluggish over the next few months.Many analysts expect that tax rises or spending cuts will be needed to meet the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules.The Institute for Fiscal Studies is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes.On Wednesday, Reeves said she was \"looking at further measures on tax and spending, to make sure that the public finances always add up\".The main driver of growth in August was the manufacturing sector, which grew by 0.7%.However, the key services sector - which covers businesses in sectors such as retail, hospitality and finance - saw no growth during August.Monthly growth figures can be volatile, and the ONS has downgraded July's figure from its initial estimate of zero growth to a 0.1% contraction.The ONS is focusing on growth over a rolling three-month period, and in the three months to August the economy expanded by 0.3%, which was a slight improvement on the previous figure.\"Economic growth increased slightly in the latest three months. Services growth held steady, while there was a smaller drag from production than previously,\" said Liz McKeown, ONS director of statistics.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said that while the economy had returned to growth in August, the \"outlook remains weak\".She said households were facing higher costs for essentials such as food, while uncertainty about potential tax rises in the Budget was \"expected to weigh on activity for both households and businesses\".\"As a result, we anticipate growth to remain sluggish over the coming months.\"Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, called August's growth \"meagre\".She said the increases in taxes for businesses that took effect in April this year - such as the rise in employers' National Insurance contributions - were \"undoubtedly playing a part in restraining growth\".\"There is little reason to think GDP growth will accelerate much from here,\" Ms Gregory said.\"The disruption to the auto sector caused by the Jaguar Land Rover cyber-attack probably meant the economy went backwards in September.\"Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that the UK would be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year.However, it also said the UK would face the highest rate of inflation among G7 nations both this year and next, as result of rising energy and utility bills.A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We have seen the fastest growth in the G7 since the start of the year, but for too many people our economy feels stuck.\"The chancellor is determined to turn this around by helping businesses in every town and high street grow, investing in infrastructure and cutting red tape to get Britain building.\"Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the latest figures \"show that growth continues to be weak and Rachel Reeves is now admitting she is going to hike taxes yet again, despite all her promises\".\"If Labour had a plan - or a backbone - they would get spending under control, cut the deficit and get taxes down.\"Daisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the government was \"simply not doing enough to kickstart growth\".\"The chancellor must quit her slowcoach approach to the economy and finally drop her damaging national insurance hike, which has stifled business and hit high streets up and down the country.\"",

Next year, the Brit Awards will also leave London, moving to Manchester.\"We've always had the aspiration to move the Mercury Prize, in particular, outside of London because it's a representation of the best music of the year from across Britain and Ireland,\" says Jo Twist, says chief executive of the BPI, which organises the Mercurys and the Brits.\"Celebrating that talent from all over the country was part of the thinking.\"Highlighting recent success stories from the north-east – including Brit Award winner Jade and last year's Mercury Prize recipients English Teacher – Twist says the music industry is making a \"big push\" to decentralise.\"Talent is everywhere but opportunity isn't,\" she says. \"So it's only right that we bring these large scale shows (outside London) to show there are opportunities within the music industry without having to move city.\"North-east 'overlooked'Coventry-born rapper Pa Salieu, who is also Mercury-nominated for his latest album Afrikan Alien, says the change was long overdue.\"I always heard of Mercury, growing up, but it seemed so far away, out of reach,\" he says.\"So I think the Mercury Prize should be in Coventry, in Birmingham. It should move like a tour. Let the youth feel heard.\"In Newcastle, the build-up to the ceremony has included a week of fringe events, including concerts from local artists and workshops for newcomers looking for their break.Among the performers is 29-year-old Finn Forster, from Teesside, who's gone from playing pubs to supporting Stereophonics on their recent European tour.Mercury fringe events to 'inspire next generation'He says he's \"super grateful for how much the music industry is taking a step outside of London and the major cities\".\"The north-east has been overlooked for so long,\" he says. \"Everyone's incredibly proud about the fact the Mercury is coming – and there's such a high calibre of people performing at the fringe.\"Thursday's ceremony will be held at the Utilita Arena, hosted by Sunderland native Lauren Laverne, with performances from nine of the 12 nominees.The 12 nominated albums are:CMAT – Euro-CountryEmma-Jean Thackray – WeirdoFKA Twigs – EusexuaFontaines DC – RomanceJacob Alon - In LimerenceJoe Webb – Hamstrings and HurricanesMartin Carthy - Transform Me Then Into a FishPa Salieu – Afrikan AlienPinkPantheress – Fancy ThatPulp – MoreSam Fender – People WatchingWolf Alice – The ClearingFull coverage will be available on BBC television, BBC Sounds, Radio 6 Music and BBC News.

    "body": "6 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: US \"looking at land now\" - Trump confirms CIA authorisation in Venezuela after boat strikesUS President Donald Trump has confirmed a report he authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela, provoking outrage from the South American nation's leader.US forces have already conducted at least five strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean in recent weeks, killing 27 people. UN-appointed human rights experts have described the raids as \"extrajudicial executions\".Speaking at the White House, Trump said the US \"is looking at land\" as it considers further strikes on drug cartels in the region. Nicolás Maduro, whose legitimacy as Venezuela's president is internationally contested after disputed elections last year, appealed on TV for peace with the US.The increased US military presence in the region has raised fears in Caracas of a possible attack. According to the New York Times, Trump's authorisation would allow the CIA to carry out operations in Venezuela unilaterally or as part of any wider US military activity. It remains unknown whether the CIA is planning operations in Venezuela, or whether those plans are being kept as contingencies, but the spy agency has a long history of activities in South America. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday alongside FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump was questioned about the New York Times report.\"Why did you authorise the CIA to go into Venezuela?\" a journalist asked.\"I authorised for two reasons really,\" Trump said in a highly unusual acknowledgement from a US commander-in-chief about an intelligence organisation whose activities are typically shrouded in secrecy. \"Number one, they [Venezuela] have emptied their prisons into the United States of America.\" He added: \"And the other thing are drugs. We have a lot of drugs coming in from Venezuela, and a lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea, so you get to see that, but we're going to stop them by land also.\"Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade. The president would not be drawn on whether the CIA's goal was to topple Maduro, for whom the US has offered a $50m (£37m) bounty. \"Wouldn't it be a ridiculous question for me to answer?\" he said. In the most recent US strike on Tuesday, six people were killed when a boat was targeted near Venezuela's coast.On Truth Social, Trump said that \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known DTO [drug-trafficking organisation] drug-trafficking route\". As has been the case in previous strikes, US officials have not specified what drug-trafficking organisation was allegedly operating the vessel, or the identities of those aboard. Maduro took to the airwaves on Wednesday night to warn against escalation.\"No to regime change, which reminds us so much of the endless, failed wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and so on,\" said the Socialist leader. \"No to CIA-orchestrated coups d'état.\"He added: \"Listen to me, no war, yes peace, the people United States.\"Earlier in the day Maduro ordered military exercises in the Caracas suburb of Petare and in neighbouring Miranda state on Wednesday. In a message on Telegram, he said he was mobilising the military, police and civilian militia to defend the oil-rich country.Foreign Minister Yván Gil said on Telegram that Venezuela \"rejects the warmongering and extravagant statements of the president of the United States\".\"We view with extreme alarm the use of the CIA, as well as the military deployments announced in the Caribbean, which amount to a policy of aggression, threat, and harassment against Venezuela,\" he added.Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-power submarine and fighter jets to the Caribbean in what the White House says is an effort to crack down on drug smuggling.In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it had determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of an organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking. Maduro has denied the claims. Mick Mulroy, a former CIA paramilitary officer and Assistant Undersecretary of Defense, told the BBC: \"In order to conduct covert action, there needs to be a presidential finding for the CIA specially authorizing it, with specific actions identified.\"Mulroy added that such a finding would mark a \"substantial increase\" in efforts against drug trafficking organizations.\"Perhaps a real life 'Sicario',\" he said, referring to a 2015 film that depicts US operatives launching clandestine operations against drug cartels in Mexico.(With additional reporting from Ione Wells)",

    "body": "5 hours agoThe main headline on the Times reads: \"Whitehall data breach gave secrets to Chinese\", as it reports that China obtained \"vast amounts\" of classified government information via a compromised network used to transfer data across Whitehall. Dominic Cummings, who served as senior adviser to Boris Johnson, told the paper that he and the then-prime minister were \"informed about the breach\" in 2020 but said that there was a \"cover-up\". The paper says the breach has been confirmed by two other Whitehall sources. The Cabinet Office has said it is \"untrue to claim that the systems we use to transfer the most sensitive government information have been compromised\". There is \"fresh pressure\" on the prime minister following the claims from Cummings, says the Mail, which writes that Sir Keir Starmer was also battling claims that the government played a role in the collapse of the case against two men accused of spying for China. Last month, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against the two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, both of whom deny the allegations.The Telegraph also leads on the quotes from Cummings, and says it was \"unclear\" whether the current government was made aware of the breach when they came to power last year. The paper adds that his allegations have raised fresh questions over \"why the government has not designated Beijing as a national security threat to the UK in the Chinese spy case\". It notes that on Wednesday night the government published statements provided by the government in the case \"amid mounting political pressure\". A photo of 16-year-old Virginia Giuffre also features on the front page, ahead of the the posthumous publication of Guiffre's book, Nobody's Girl, next week.The Daily Express picks up on comments from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions earlier on Wednesday, when she declared the collapse of the spy trial \"stinks of a China cover-up\". The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing. However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time. In response to her comments at PMQs, Sir Keir said the government would publish evidence submitted in the now-collapsed case.The Guardian notes that on Wednesday evening Downing Street released three witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser that were submitted in the now-collapsed case. Its main headline is: \"Budget will raise taxes on wealthy to fix public finances\", after Chancellor Rachel Reeves spoke on Wednesday at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The chancellor told the paper that there \"won't be a return to austerity\" when \"hinting\" at tax increases for wealthier Britons, despite previously ruling out imposing a \"wealth tax\" in her upcoming Budget.The i Paper is leading with an exclusive on a leaked memo, which they allege reveals plans by Labour to \"slash the affordable homes target\" in London. The paper says that developers could only be required to to hit a 20% target, instead of the current 35%, which housing experts warn is \"a huge blow to social housing\" with a \"ripple effect across the UK\". Financiers have sounded the alarm on the \"erosion of lending standards\", according to the Financial Times. The paper said that credit markets have been \"shaken\" following the collapse of First Brands Group and Tricolour holdings, following years of lenders \"searching out riskier borrowers\".The Thursday edition of the Sun marks one year since the death of One Direction star Liam Payne, featuring \"haunting\" photographs that the paper alleges were taken hours before the singer's death.\"£145m owed... not a penny paid back\" alleges the Mirror, amid reports that PPE Medpro failed to meet their Wednesday deadline to repay damages after it was found to have breached a Covid-19 personal protective equipment contact. The paper said that Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting has vowed to go after the company \"with everything we've got\". The Metro has led with a story about a 42-year-old Polish woman who has been found \"emaciated\" in her parent's apartment after vanishing \"without a trace\" 27 years ago. The paper says that an investigation is ongoing, but no charges have been laid. The Star reports that media personality and model Katie Price has alleged she was raped by a \"well-known British TV star\", who she named at a stage show on Tuesday evening.The government's publication of the advice in the collapsed China spying case came too late for many of the early editions, but the Guardian saw the documents - and says that while the third statement was similar to the language sought by prosecutors, they did not think it was sufficient to allow the case to proceed.  The paper says the Director of Public Prosecutions told senior MPs that the statements were \"five per cent less than the evidence threshold that was needed.\" The Times says the documents are likely to intensify questions among MPs about why the prosecution did not go ahead.The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the Guardian that people should take scaremongering about her upcoming budget with a pinch of salt. \"Of course we're looking at tax and spending,\" the Daily Mirror quotes her as saying - in what it calls her \"clearest hint yet about her plans.\" The Times adds that she has vowed to increase taxes on the wealthy, rather than cut public spending. The Daily Mail says she blames Brexit, austerity, Nigel Farage and the Conservatives for the tax hikes; \"Is ANY of it your fault, Chancellor?\" it asks. The Daily Telegraph notes the International Monetary Fund is projecting that taxes will rise faster in Britain than in any other G7 country over this Parliament.Many of the papers have been reading the posthumous book by one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre. The Mail says her memoir - entitled Nobody's Girl - claims Prince Andrew thanked her after an alleged sexual encounter when she was seventeen. The Sun highlights a quote attributed to Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, who apparently told her \"You did well... the Prince had fun.\" The paper says Giuffre has damned the Duke of York from beyond the grave. Prince Andrew has always strongly denied the claims against him.The i Paper says a leaked memo has revealed that Labour plans to slash affordable home targets - in a bid to revive flatlining building levels. The paper says such a move would be needed to help the government meet its pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.\"As if by magic,\" notes the Guardian, potholes were repaired in a village in Devon ahead of the filming of a new TV adaptation of the Harry Potter books there. \"Harry Pothole\" is the Telegraph's headline.Related Internet Links",

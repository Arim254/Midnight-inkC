    "body": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that he has apologised to US President Donald Trump over an anti-tariff advertisement which had used a Ronald Reagan quote. Last week, in response to the advert, Trump suspended trade talks with Canada and said he would impose an additional 10% tariff on Canadian imports.\"I did apologise to the president,\" Carney told reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea on Saturday. The commercial used a series of clips from former President Reagan's 1987 national radio address, in which he argued that tariffs would hurt America's economy. \"Such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,\" Reagan said in the speech. Carney said the advert - which was funded by the province of Ontario - was \"not something I would have done\" and added Trump was \"offended\" by it. Trump said on Friday that Carney had apologised to him and added that the two had a \"very good\" relationship. But, he said, \"what he did was wrong\". Carney said that Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario who was responsible for the advert, had shown the clip to him beforehand and the prime minister advised him not to go forward with it. The advert aired during the first two baseball World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ford said the TV spot had garnered \"one billion views\" as well as attention from as far as the UK and India.The commercial reportedly led to an \"expletive-laced tirade\" between US envoy Pete Hoekstra and Ontario trade representative David Paterson.Ford said Hoekstra had made remarks that were \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said he needed to call Paterson to apologise. Since taking office, Trump has imposed tariffs on a host of nations, including Canada. The US has a 35% tariff on Canadian goods, though most are exempt under an existing free trade agreement. Certain sectors, however, have separate tariffs, including 50% on steel and aluminium and 25% on automobiles.Trump this week accused Canada of using the advert to interfere in an upcoming US Supreme Court case that will weigh whether the president's sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China and dozens of other countries are legal.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames DelaneyBBC ScotlandSNSWillie Young, who won the FA Cup with Arsenal, has died aged 73The former Aberdeen and Arsenal defender Willie Young has died at the age of 73.Young played more than 180 games for the Dons before going on to lift the FA Cup with the Gunners in 1979.He is perhaps best remembered for forcing a change in the laws of the game and the creation of the \"professional foul\" following his tackle on West Ham forward Paul Allen in the 1980 final of the competition.In a statement, Arsenal said his \"physicality and commitment made him a cult figure\" with the club's supporters.They added: \"Reliable, dominant in the air and fearless, his immense contribution to a successful period means he will always be remembered fondly by those who saw his colossal frame repelling attacks and causing havoc to opposition defences at set pieces.\"Posting on X, Aberdeen said the club was \"saddened\" to learn of his passing.SNSYoung began his career at AberdeenBorn in Edinburgh, Young grew up in the village of Heriot in Midlothian and began his career at Aberdeen in 1970.He spent five years at the club before joining Tottenham Hotspur in 1975.He made a controversial move across North London to Arsenal two years later, linking up with his former manager at Spurs, Terry Neill.With his towering 6ft 3in frame and trademark ginger hair, he formed a formidable defensive partnership with Irish centre back David O'Leary, reaching three straight FA Cup finals between 1978 and 1980.He earned a winners' medal in the 3-2 defeat of Manchester United in the \"five-minute final\" of 1979.Getty ImagesYoung in the back row with his arms outstretched following Arsenal's FA Cup final win over Manchester United in 1979But it was his scything down of a then-17-year-old Allen in the 1-0 defeat to West Ham the following year which etched his name in the history of the game.With the forward bearing down on goal in the dying stages, Young cynically hacked him down on the edge of the area, preventing a near-certain goal.He received a yellow card for the incident, but it prompted a national debate on the need for a specific law governing professional fouls.Automatic red cards for \"denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity\" were introduced two years later.Young also played in Arsenal's 1980 Cup Winners' Cup final defeat to Valencia in Brussels.Scotland banDespite his success at club level, Young never made a senior appearance for Scotland due to a lifetime ban incurred following an altercation at a Danish nightclub.The \"Copenhagen five,\" Young, Joe Harper, Arthur Graham, Billy Bremner and Pat McCluskey, were all excommunicated from the national set-up over the incident.Harper and Graham were later reinstated after being cleared of any wrongdoing but Young was never allowed to pull on the dark blue jersey.He departed Arsenal in 1981 after 237 appearances, joining Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest.Young retired in 1984 due to injuries following short spells at Norwich City, Brighton and Hove Albion and Darlington.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,Reporting from KingstonA flight carrying British aid arrived in Jamaica early on Saturday to help with recovery efforts after Hurricane Melissa, as the UK plans its first chartered flight to bring British nationals home later on Saturday.The aid flight brought more than 3,000 emergency shelter kits as part of a £7.5 million regional emergency package.Part of the funding will be used to match donations to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those who have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, fallen trees and landslides have complicated distribution efforts after Hurricane Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 19 people.The hurricane made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a category five storm and was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the Caribbean.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days and left behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 30 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".The UK initially set aside a £2.5 million immediate financial support package, with an additional £5 million announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday.Cooper said the announcement came as \"more information is now coming through on the scale of devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, with homes damaged, roads blocks and lives lost\".The British Red Cross said, as of Saturday morning, that 72% people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.The organisation said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.Although aid is entering the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made some roads impassable. The situation has made it difficult to get aid to the worst-hit areas.Some communities are being affected by water shortages, while the BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others for a car to reach an area in which they can contact people, as the power is still down across most of the island.Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK's first chartered flight to bring British citizens home is set to leave Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport late on Saturday.The UK foreign office has asked travellers to register their presence on the island.The department also advises travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options are available.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the defence of Pokrovsk is a \"priority\", as elite special force were deployed to the embattled town on the eastern front line.Ukrainian army sources told the BBC that special forces from military intelligence and assault groups were being used as regular infantry to protect supply lines to troops holding the town in the Donbas region.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of Donetsk. Ukraine has denied claims their forces were surrounded.Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the entire Donbas region as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Russia currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed in 2014.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold onto the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Local media reports that the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, was in the region to personally oversee the operation.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign was succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on its two largest oil producers and axing plans for a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has indicated he was open to Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Russia has publicly insisted Ukrainian troops leave the remainder of the Donbas.In his nightly address, the Ukrainian president said: \"Pokrovsk is our priority. We continue to destroy the occupier, and that is what matters most... They must be halted where they have reached - and destroyed there.\"Images shared with news agencies appear show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry has claimed it thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, saying all 11 troops who landed by helicopter had been killed.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.\"The situation in the city has changed so much that [Ukraine's commander-in-chief, General] Syrsky is now sending elite units into the city to stabilise it,\" he said.These included special forces and assault units in Ukraine's Defence Intelligence agency (GUR), he said.\"Fighting is now taking place for the railway station and the industrial zone in the west. The battles for the industrial zone have almost reduced logistics from roughly vehicle-based to foot-based. \"The Ukrainian Armed Forces are not in a physical encirclement, but in an operational one - this means that all logistics are under fire control.\"The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsA 60-day cruise around Australia has been cancelled days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind by the ship on a remote island.Suzanne Rees had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) is investigating the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner.The CEO of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said on Saturday that passengers and crew on the Coral Adventurer were told on Wednesday that the remainder of the voyage had been cancelled due to the \"tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues\".He added in a statement that passengers would be issued a full refund, and said Coral Expeditions was working \"to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights\".Amsa also released an updated statement on Saturday, saying it had \"issued a notice to the Master of Coral Adventurer\" prohibiting any new passengers from boarding the ship.The spokesperson said that officials would attend the vessel in Cairns upon its return.The ship initially left the north-western city on 24 October, and was just two days into the voyage at the time of the 80-year-old's death. Lizard Island was the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard - who typically pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise - were transported there for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said on Thursday that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Earlier this week, Mr Fifield confirmed that Coral Expeditions was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".He said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] on board just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening\", Ms Mallinson added. \"This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off.\"",

She appeared before a magistrate, who ruled that she should stay in custody.The woman was arrested earlier this week with four others. Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenFour men carried out the lightning-quick daylight theft. Two of the alleged thieves - who had been arrested earlier - later admitted their involvement, while the fourth person has not yet been caught.Appearing before the magistrate on Saturday, the woman was in tears as she confirmed that she lived in Paris's northern suburb of La Courneuve, a journalist working for the AFP news agency reported.She was one of the five people arrested earlier this week in and around the French capital. One of those held has been released without charge.However, one of the five is thought to have taken part in the heist.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30 (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.The jewels have not been found.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.

He was a proud family man who spent a lot of his time with his son, both working with and socially. Peter loved to have meals out with his wife and had a particularly sweet tooth.\"The aircraft had taken off from Retford Gamston Airport, in Nottinghamshire, shortly before it crashed in the Doncaster suburb of Bentley, off Ings Lane, just after 10:00 GMT.South Yorkshire Police and the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.In the statement, the family said they were supporting the investigation and asked people \"to not speculate on the circumstances surrounding the accident\".\"We would like to ask for privacy during this incredibly difficult time to allow us to come to terms with what has occurred and grieve for the loss of Peter,\" they added.Police were called to a field in Bentley at about 10:15 GMT on ThursdayA spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site on Thursday.The aircraft is understood to have been owned by Kuki Helicopters, based at Retford Gamston Airport.

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew was stripped of his title as a prince on ThursdayMembers of a US congressional committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case have intensified their calls for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to answer questions about his links to the late sex offender.King Charles stripped his brother of his \"prince\" title on Thursday, following months of pressure over Andrew's ties to Epstein. Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.At least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: \"If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward\".Andrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said.\"Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. \"So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.\"He added: \"No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.\"Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena - although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US. Everything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proud\"Read the King's statement in fullWatch: Question Time audience reacts to newsIs this finally rock bottom for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandalWhere does the King get his money?He said on Friday: \"However, if Andrew wishes to come to the United States or he's here, then he's subject to the jurisdiction of the US Congress, and I would expect him to testify.\"He added: \"At the end of the day, we want to know exactly what happened, not just to give justice to the survivors, but to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\"Come clean. Come before the US Congress, voluntarily testify. Don't wait for a subpoena. Come and testify and tell us what you know.\"Congressman Stephen Lynch also told the BBC hearing from Andrew \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\" but said the committee would be unable to subpoena him \"as the situation stands\".Meanwhile, Liz Stein - one of Epstein's accusers - said Andrew should \"take some initiative\" and help US investigators.She told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \"A lot of us are curious as to why he's unwilling to cooperate and be questioned about his involvement with Epstein.\"\"If he has nothing to hide, then why is he hiding?\"\"We know he had a longstanding friendship with Epstein and that he was in his social circle - so he may have seen things during his involvement with Epstein that he could speak to.\"Another of Epstein's accusers, Anouska De Georgiou, likewise told Newsnight Andrew should appear before Congress, saying \"it would be appropriate for him to be treated the same as anybody else would be treated\".Getty ImagesLiz Stein said Andrew should step in and help investigators It comes after UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should go to the US to answer questions about Epstein's crimes if invited, \"just as with any ordinary member of the public\".Meanwhile, the police watchdog said it had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask whether there are matters it should be looking into, in light of media reports about Andrew.The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it had contacted Scotland Yard's Directorate of Professional Standards last week - which oversees internal investigations into misconduct - and had not yet received any referrals.Reports emerged in mid-October that Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection in 2011. He has not commented on the reports, while the Metropolitan Police previously said it was \"actively\" looking into them.Separately, new court documents published in the US on Friday showed that Andrew wrote in an email in 2010 that it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after he was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The pair were then pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later told the BBC was to break off their friendship.Andrew's ties to Epstein were at the centre of Thursday's decision, with the Palace announcement stating: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"In recent weeks, pressure had increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother.In early October, emails which re-emerged from 2011 showed Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship had ended.A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre was also released - repeating allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has always denied.And earlier this week, the King was heckled about the matter.Although Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.As well as losing his titles and honours, he was ordered to move out of his Windsor mansion - Royal Lodge - and into a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.The BBC understands that he will not have to move out immediately, and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.On Saturday, a black Land Rover with a number plate ending DOY was seen leaving Bishops Gate near Royal Lodge just before 08:00 GMT.Only a driver was in the vehicle as it left the grounds of Windsor Great Park. Andrew has previously been pictured driving a vehicle with the same private number plate.",

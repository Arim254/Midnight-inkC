    "body": "2 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesTwo identical twins on trial for murder in France have confounded attempts to determine which one pulled the trigger because they have the same DNA, French media report.The 33-year-old brothers are among five defendants on trial near Paris, accused of a double murder and several subsequent attempted killings in 2020, according to reputable French newspaper Le Parisien.It reports that both are suspected of conspiring to plot the double murder, but that DNA on an assault rifle used in one of the later gun battles could only be from one twin.A police officer told the court that forensic experts were unable to tell which of the brothers had been conclusively implicated.\"Only their mother can tell them apart,\" one investigator is quoted as telling the court in Bobigny, north of the French capital.There is reportedly a tense atmosphere in the court where the trial is taking place. On Tuesday, both twins were said to have been expelled from the courtroom for refusing to stand up.Police believe they have taken advantage of their resemblance to cover their tracks. A senior officer quoted by Le Parisien said the pair frequently exchanged clothes, phones and identification documents.Identical twins develop from a single fertilised egg that splits during pregnancy. Because they originate from the same egg and sperm, they share exactly the same DNA, making forensic identification extremely difficult.With genetic data unable to distinguish between them, investigators relied on phone records, surveillance footage, wiretaps and efforts to corroborate their whereabouts and movements, according to Le Parisien.But the crucial question of who fired the recovered weapon remains an open one. The trial continues, with court due to reach a decision in late February.",

    "body": "Just nowPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesMorgan McSweeney has dramatically quit as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff, after mounting scrutiny over his role in Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US.The PM's adviser had been coming under pressure after pushing for the former minister to be given the job, despite the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein being publicly known about at the time.McSweeney said he did not oversee the vetting but wanted to take \"full responsibility\" for advising the prime minister to appoint him.It leaves Sir Keir battling to shore up his premiership as he continues to face anger from Labour MPs over his decision to hire the peer for the Washington role.Sir Keir sacked Lord Mandelson in September, after emails emerged showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences.But further revelations this week from the latest release of Epstein files in the US about his continued contact with the late disgraced financier after his conviction in 2008 have led to fresh fury within Labour over the decision to hand him the role.Emails suggesting the peer leaked sensitive government information to Epstein whilst a minister in the last Labour government have also prompted a police investigation into alleged misconduct in public office.Sir Keir has said Lord Mandelson's prior relationship was Epstein was flagged when he was vetted for the role, whilst insisting the former cabinet minister misled him about the depth of the relationship.But it has failed to contain the row over the decision, with a handful of Labour MPs now openly calling for Starmer to resign as party leader.The prime minister is expected to publicly address the episode as soon as Monday, as he seeks convince his backbenchers he can regain control of the situation.It comes as the boss of the Fire Brigades Union, Steve Wright, became the first leader of one of Labour's 11 affiliated unions to call for the prime minister to go, adding \"everybody's thinking it\".McSweeney's departure is a big blow to Sir Keir, with the 48-year-old Irishman having masterminded his successful bid for the Labour leadership in 2020 and the party's campaign for the general election in 2024.His deputies Jill Cuthbertson and Vidhya Alakeson have been appointed acting chiefs of staff in the wake of his exit, Downing Street has confirmed.'Only honourable course'In a statement on Sunday, McSweeney said Lord Mandelson's appointment in December 2024 had been \"wrong\", adding he had \"damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.\"\"When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice,\" he added.\"While I did not oversee the due diligence and vetting process, I believe that process must now be fundamentally overhauled,\" he added.\"In the circumstances, the only honourable course is to step aside.\"It is understood that both the prime minister and McSweeney decided now was the right moment for him to leave. Sir Keir said it had been an \"honour\" to work with him, thanking him for \"turning our party around\" in the wake of its crushing defeat in the 2019 election. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"about time\" McSweeney resigned, but added the prime minister \"has to take responsibility for his own terrible decisions\". Pay-off pleaThe statement from McSweeney came just hours after a key Starmer ally had dismissed calls from within Labour for Sir Keir to sack his adviser.Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden told Laura Kuenssberg it would not make \"any difference at all\" to the situation facing the government.He also called on Lord Mandelson to return or donate to charity the pay-off he received after his sacking as ambassador, thought to be up to £40,000.The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.Email exchanges in the latest US government release on Epstein include several from Lord Mandelson during his time as a cabinet minister in the Labour government of Gordon Brown.Among them is one that indicates Lord Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010.Another suggests he forwarded the financier an internal No 10 memo in 2009 discussing potential government asset sales in the wake of the financial crash.Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. He has resigned as a member of the House of Lords, with the government pledging to introduce legislation required to strip him of his title. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoAndy VerityGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor appears to have knowingly shared confidential information with Jeffrey Epstein from his official work as trade envoy in 2010 and 2011, according to material in the latest release of files in the US seen by the BBC.Emails from the recently-released batch of Epstein files show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam and confidential details of investment opportunities.Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.The former Duke of York, who served as trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, has been contacted for comment but is yet to respond.Andrew has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Being named in the Epstein files is not an indication of misconduct.The emails indicate that on 7 October 2010, Andrew sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of Epstein.After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then-special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.US Department of JusticeAndrew told BBC Newsnight in 2019 that he last saw Epstein in New York in early December 2010 to tell the disgraced financier he was breaking off the friendship.However, on Christmas Eve that year, he emailed Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.Sir Vince Cable, who was then business secretary, said: \"I was unaware of Andrew... sharing information about investment opportunities [in Afghanistan] before, this is the first I've heard of it.\"In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew suggests Epstein might invest in a private equity firm he visited a week before.Official terms of reference for trade envoys state that they \"are not civil servants\", adding: \"However, the role of a Trade Envoy carries with it a duty of confidentiality in relation to information received. This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits.\"This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.\"Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.Buckingham Palace had announced in October that he would be moving from Royal Lodge, at the same time his title of prince was removed.The former prince left the property on Monday night and is currently living at Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate while his new permanent home undergoes renovations.",

Jeff Narvil, 57, an administrative law judge from Jackson, Mississippi, has spent the past 14 months studying Welsh, largely on his own, often in the early hours of the morning. In January, he travelled to Cardiff to take the A1 Welsh-language exam, which tests reading, writing, listening and speaking. He said the experience had been challenging but rewarding and he hoped to carry on learning the language. Jeff NarvilJeff may have had to learn Welsh largely solo, but his dog Ruger did at least provide some positive reinforcement Originally from Atlanta, Georgia, he has learned Spanish, French, German and Irish, and said returning to language learning as an adult felt like revisiting something he had once loved.\"I have always had an interest in learning other languages\", he said, explaining Welsh appealed to him because it is spoken by choice rather than necessity.\"Nobody's required to do it, but they do out of love for their culture, and that was really attractive to me.\"He began studying Welsh in late 2024 using apps, textbooks and online resources, but said the lack of people to practise within the US made learning difficult.Time difference added to the challenge, with some online courses scheduled for the early hours of the morning in Mississippi. \"That just doesn't work\", he said, explaining he sometimes had to wake up before 03:00 to take part in lessons.\"It would be a dream if I became fluent and people tried to guess which part of Wales I was from,\" he added.Jeff NarvilJeff and Fran travelled across Wales, including to Caernarfon castleAlongside the exam in Cardiff, Jeff and his wife Fran travelled across the country, visiting Caerphilly castle, St Davids in Pembrokeshire, Betwys-y-Coed in Conwy county and Harlech in Gwynedd. \"I did fall in love with Wales when I visited, but I actually started leaning Welsh before I had properly seen it,\" Jeff said.\"I was glad I didn't plan to be in Cardiff the whole week,\" he said. \"I really enjoyed the little towns.\"He also had the chance to practise his Welsh with local people, including shop staff and cafe workers, and said people were encouraging and patient when he explained he was learning the language.Although he does not yet know whether he passed the exam, Mr Narvil said taking it head already achieved its purpose.\"It would be very embarrassing if I didn't pass,\" he joked, adding he still planned to continue learning.\"Even if I fail the exam, I will definitely come back.\"Jeff's exam results are expected in early March.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersFriday's shooting took place at a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of MoscowRussia says it has identified three suspects involved in the shooting of high-profile military figure Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev. They include the man accused of having carried out the attack, named as Ukrainian-born Russian citizen Lyubomir Korba. Russia's Investigations Committee (SK) said Korba arrived in the capital, Moscow, in late December \"on assignment from Ukrainian intelligence services to commit a terrorist attack\". Kyiv has reportedly denied involvement.Alexeyev, 64, was taken to hospital after the attack in a residential block of flats in the north-western outskirts of Moscow on Friday. He has since regained consciousness following surgery, according to Russian media reports.Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, and the latest high-ranking military figure to have been targeted in or near Moscow since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said on Sunday that his attacker had fired three shots before fleeing and that Korba had then travelled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the hours after the shooting. He has since been arrested and extradited. Russian state TV channel Ru-24 aired footage showing security agents escorting Korba off a plane at an unknown location.\"Investigators conducted a thorough inspection at the scene, during which they discovered the murder weapon - a Makarov pistol with a silencer and three rounds of ammunition,\" Petrenko added. Forensic tests are being carried out on the gun. Russian media, quoting Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, reported that President Vladimir Putin had thanked UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Saturday for his country's help in catching Korba.Russian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligenceUkrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha was quoted by Reuters as saying on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with the shooting, suggesting that it was an internal Russian affair. His Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov accused Kyiv of carrying out the attack as a way to disrupt negotiations on ending the war between the two countries, which began in February 2022. Alexeyev's boss, GRU head Adm Igor Kostyukov, has been leading the Russian delegation at recent trilateral talks with Ukraine and the US in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE. Korba is alleged to have had at least one accomplice. A man named by the SK as Viktor Vasin has been arrested and charged by the authorities in Moscow.A woman named as Zinaida Serebritskaya, who has since left for Ukraine, is also thought to be involved, but Petrenko did not elaborate on how. Ukraine has claimed some attacks on Russian military figures in the past, while Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.An Uzbek man was jailed in January for the 2024 killing of another general, Igor Kirillov, in an explosion outside a block of flats in Moscow. Sources in Ukraine's SBU intelligence said at the time that it had been behind the attack.Lt Gen Kirillov had been in charge of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.In December 2025, another high-ranking officer in the GRU, Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, was killed when an explosive device detonated under a car in Moscow. He was in charge of the armed force's operational training department, according to the SK.Russia is also thought to have targeted high-profile Ukrainian military and political figures during the Russia-Ukraine war.Last July, Ukrainian security services said they had thwarted an attempt on the life of Serhiy Filimonov, commander of an assault unit known as the \"Da Vinci Wolves\".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself been subjected to numerous assassination and kidnapping plots, and Kyrylo Budanov - who until January this year was head of Ukraine's military intelligence - also says he has been targeted.",

The Narges Foundation says the latest sentence brings the total time she has been ordered to spend in prison to 44 years.Since 2021, she has been serving a 13-year sentence for \"propaganda activity against the state\" and \"collusion against state security\", charges she denies.The activist was given temporary release from Tehran's notorious Evin prison for three weeks in December 2024 on medical grounds.She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences.The most recent arrest came as she attended a memorial for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer who had been found dead in his office in early December.Norway-based group Iran Human Rights has called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances surrounding his death were \"suspicious\".The Narges Foundation previously said eyewitnesses had seen Mohammadi being attacked by around 15 plainclothes agents of the regime while at the memorial event, and that some were seen pulling her hair and beating her with clubs and batons.Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar told reporters that Mohammadi had been among 39 people arrested, and she and Alikordi's brother had encouraged those present \"to chant norm-breaking slogans\" and \"disturb the peace\".Mohammadi was among signatories of a petition that expressed criticism of the Iranian authorities and held Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responsible for what it called \"crimes against humanity\" over the killing of protesters during unrest that began in late December.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has counted more than 50,000 arrests related to the demonstrations and had confirmed that more than 6,500 protesters have been killed.The petition called for the prosecution of those acting on Khamenei's orders and an end to the Islamic Republic.Four prominent Iranian activists - identified as Abdollah Momeni, Mehdi Mahmoudian, Vida Rabbani and Ghorban Behzadian-Nejad - have also been arrested since 31 January for their contribution to the petition.Taghi Rahmani urged the release of \"all political prisoners in Iran\".",

    "body": "54 minutes agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, BangkokandThanyarat Doksone,BangkokThailand election explained as voters head to the pollsPrime Minister Anutin Charnavirakul has claimed victory in Thailand's general election, with preliminary vote counts putting his ruling conservatives well ahead of their rivals.Anutin said his success belonged to \"all Thais, no matter whether you voted for us or not\", after his party's expected result defied opinion polls that had placed the reformist People's Party ahead.With 90% of the votes counted, Anutin's Bhumjaithai party projected to win 194 seats in Bangkok's 500-seat parliament, with the People's Party in second place on 116.People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut appeared to concede the election, saying he was ready to serve in opposition if Anutin could form a government.The election was called after several coalition governments collapsed, giving the country three prime ministers in as many years.While no party is projected to gain an overall majority, paving the way for coalition talks, Anutin is now almost certain to stay in office.Elections in Thailand are often unpredictable, and so it proved this time. This shock result is a huge disappointment for the People's Party, which had expected to improve on its winning performance of three years ago. But a widely expected \"orange wave\" of support for its young, idealistic candidates did not materialise.The party, which won the election in 2023 but was blocked from taking power, found itself pushed into second place by Anutin's pragmatic conservatives. The reformists will remain in opposition for now. The feared crisis that could have occurred had they won, and once again been barred from office, has been averted.ReutersPM Anutin celebrated at his party's Bangkok headquartersOpinion polls have frequently been wrong in Thailand, but there will be a lot of post-election analysis of how Anutin turned his once small, provincial Bhumjaithai - \"Thai Pride\"-  party into a such formidable electoral machine.Playing on patriotic sentiment after the two short border wars with Cambodia last year, Anutin's party became the standard-bearer for conservatives, promising to defend the status of traditional Thai institutions like the monarchy and military.He campaigned on hard-line nationalist sentiments and populist giveaways - but his victory was also down to his ability to win local power-brokers to his side, in an electoral system where 80% of seats were decided on a first-past-the-post basis.The People's Party did well in the proportional votes, where it appears to have got more votes than any other party. But it was unable to overcome its lack of networks at a local level.The third main contender was the Shinawatra family and its Pheu Thai – \"For Thais\" – party, which is projected to win 86 seats.In the past it dominated elections, with well-marketed populist policies. It had promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht – every day through a national prize draw. Both Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai have offered subsidies and cash handouts to voters.Pheu Thai was expected to lose significant support in this election after its last coalition administration was accused of mishandling the conflict with Cambodia, and its patriarch, former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, was sent to jail. Getty ImagesPeople in Thailand voted in the election throughout SundayThailand's once dynamic economy has ground to a halt as political instability and the lack of structural changes worry foreign investors. Voters, meanwhile, had voiced concerns about rising costs. \"I want the economy to improve and I don't want big factories to relocate to our neighbouring countries,\" civil servant Phananya Bunthong told the BBC, a reference to Thailand falling behind Vietnam. The People's Party promised big changes, from curbing the power of the biggest businesses and military, to streamlining the extensive bureaucracy and modernising the education system.  But in Thailand, even a straight election victory may not have been enough, as powerful, unelected forces have repeatedly intervened to block parties challenging the status quo.Two previous incarnations of the People's Party were dissolved by the court, and their leaders banned from politics. When the young reformers won last time, the military-appointed senate barred them from forming a government and the constitutional court dissolved the party.They are not the only ones to have been subjected to intervention by the  constitutional court, and other unelected conservative institutions. Five Pheu Thai prime ministers have been dismissed by the court since 2008, and two earlier incarnations of the party have been dissolved. But if the People's Party had exceeded the 151 seats it won in 2023, it may have proven difficult to bar it from forming a government. This is despite the great unease about its radical agenda in conservative and royalist circles.The projected result means the People's Party's opponents will not be in this position, for now.Besides the election, Thais have voted in a referendum on whether to reform the 2017 constitution, which was drafted under military rule in 2017. Critics of the charter believe it gives too much power to unelected forces like the senate, \"handcuffing\" the country's democracy.With over 90% of votes counted, preliminary tallies suggested around 65% had voted in favour. \"I want change. I don't want things to be the same,\"  28-year-old Kittitat Daengkongkho told the BBC.  That, in effect, was the choice Thai voters were presented with in this election: sweeping change, or more of the same.",

    "body": "3 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondent,andJosh CheethamGetty ImagesSanae Takaichi appeared at the LDP headquarters on Sunday night for the vote countJapan's ruling party, led by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, is projected to have won Sunday's snap election by a landslide.An exit poll by public broadcaster NHK suggests the coalition led by Takaichi's Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) is set to win two-thirds of seats in Japan's House of Representatives. The LDP alone is forecast to have a majority of seats.The country's first female prime minister had sought a clear public mandate by calling the election just four months after becoming party leader.Her apparent success is in marked contrast to her two predecessors, under whom the party lost its parliamentary majority due to corruption scandals and rising costs.Takaichi previously pledged to step down if her party failed to secure a majority, and some called the snap election a big gamble.The LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament in 2024, and its decades-old coalition with the Komeito party collapsed.But Takaichi's personal popularity appears to have helped the party, with approval ratings for her government mostly hovering above 70%.The LDP and its current coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, could secure as many as 366 of the 465 seats in the House of Representatives, according to NHK projections as votes continue to be counted.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has already hailed a \"big victory\" for Takaichi, saying that \"when Japan is strong, the US is strong in Asia\".People across Japan braved snow to vote in the country's first mid-winter poll in 36 years.Watch: Tokyo residents head to the polls amid rare city snowfallJapan's transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.\"People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes,\" Ritsuko Ninomiya, a voter in Tokyo, told the BBC. Takaichi's enthusiasm, populist spending promises and nationalist rhetoric appear to have energised voters.Her social media presence has also cultivated new followers, particularly among young voters. She regularly shares clips of her daily life and political activities, and a video of her playing the drums with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung is one of many clips to have gone viral.Chika Nakayama/BBCRumi and Daniel Hayama with their son  \"I think this election is more important for the younger generation, people like us,\" Daniel Hayama said, adding that the cold weather was not a hurdle for young people who want to vote.Takaichi and the LDP faced a more unified opposition than before. LDP's former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.Takaichi has pushed to toughen the immigration system, review rules around foreign ownership of Japanese land, and tackle any non-payments of tax and health insurance by foreign nationals.But in a country where only 3% of the population are foreign nationals, critics have accused her of creating anxiety and division.Getty ImagesCritics, including businesses, are sceptical that her pledge to spend more and cut taxes can revive the sluggish Japanese economy. The country's government debt is already one of the highest among developed nations.Relations with China - Japan's largest trading partner - have been strained as well, after Takaichi suggested last November that Japan could intervene militarily if China invaded Taiwan.With a two-thirds majority, Takaichi would be a strong position to considering her long-held aim of changing Japan's pacifist constitution.Takaichi has courted Donald Trump, who has publicly endorsed her - an unusual move by a US president - and they both seem to agree that Japan should spend more on defence. That relationship too was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on Sunday.\"I am concerned with what President Trump is doing as well as the national defence issues. I am not sure where the money is coming from to cover that. So balancing budget spending between defence and people's life is a major concern for me,\" Yuko Sakai says.Additional reporting by Kelly Ng and Chika Nakayama",

    "body": "2 hours agoHafsa KhalilS Pace/BBC Weather WatchersFlooding in Windsor and Maidenhead on SundayDozens of flood warnings and alerts have been issued across England following days of rain.There were 97 warnings and 217 alerts in England as of Sunday evening. Most of the warnings are located in the south-west and the Midlands. There are currently seven flood warnings and two alerts in Scotland and none in Wales.The rainfall is set to continue into next week, with the Met Office issuing a yellow warning for rain that covers southwest England and parts of south Wales, lasting from 12:00 to 23:59 on Monday.The Met Office said on Thursday that rain had fallen every day of 2026 in south-west England and South Wales, with both areas seeing 50% more rainfall than usual.Watch: BBC Weather's forecast for Sunday and Monday, as flood warnings and alerts issued across EnglandThe UK was hit by a succession of three named storms in January, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and disruption.The Environment Agency said its teams were on the ground to reduce flooding impact and support affected communities.In a statement on Sunday, the agency said it estimated at least 300 properties had been reported as flooded, with around 16,200 more now having been protected.\"We urge people not to drive though flood water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car,\" Sarah Cook, the agency's flood duty manager cautioned.Flood warnings are clustered in Devon and Hampshire, as well as between Gloucester and Worcester. However, more than 200 flood alerts are scattered across much of England apart from the far north and East Anglia.Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service warned that flooding was \"imminent\" after \"heavy prolonged rainfall\" had caused local levels at the River Dene to rise.Rain is expected to continue falling throughout the weekend and into the start of the new week.Floods minister Emma Hardy said her thoughts were with those affected as she urged residents to follow local advice over the coming days.Northern Ireland has had its wettest January in 149 years, while County Down and Cornwall had the wettest January on record, according to the Met Office.February has also seen similarly intense rainfall.Saza/BBC Weather WatchersProvisional Met Office data shows some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days of the month than it would normally expect over the course of the whole month.Aberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving over 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.Last week, Storm Chandra brought flooding and travel disruption, and saw dozens of schools close.It was the third named storm to batter the UK so far this year, after Ingrid and Goretti.",

    "body": "England slide to defeat as batting woes continueImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England have now lost nine overseas ODIs in a rowByTimothy AbrahamBBC Sport journalistUpdated 4 hours agoSecond one-day international, HamiltonEngland 175 (36 overs): Overton 42 (28); Tickner 4-34New Zealand 177-5 (33.1 overs): Mitchell 56* (59) Ravindra 54 (58); Archer 3-23New Zealand won by five wickets; lead series 2-0ScorecardEngland's top order collapsed again as their pre-Ashes preparations suffered a setback with a five-wicket defeat by New Zealand in the second one-day international in Hamilton.The tourists were bowled out for 175 with 14 overs of their innings left unused before New Zealand knocked off the runs with relative ease to clinch the series 2-0 with one match left to play.Jamie Overton top scored for England as he bludgeoned 42 off 28 balls during a counter-attacking knock.That innings came after Test players Jamie Smith, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell and Brook had all got starts without being able to manifest them into anything of greater substance.Blair Tickner claimed 4-34 while fellow seamer Nathan Smith took 2-27 as the rest of England's order stumbled to a underwhelming total against a disciplined New Zealand attack.Jofra Archer gave England some early hope with the ball when he pinned opener Will Young lbw with the fourth delivery of the Black Caps' innings.Kane Williamson showed his nous as he soaked up the pressure with a gritty 21 before he was dismissed by Overton.England still had hope when Archer ended Rachin Ravindra's fluent innings of 54 and then strangled Michael Bracewell down the leg side.But Daryl Mitchell's unbeaten 56 and skipper Mitchell Santner's breezy 34 not out got New Zealand home with a mammoth 101 balls to spare.The tourists will hope for an improvement in the third ODI on Saturday (01:00 GMT) while this match will be best remembered for:England's top-order struggles continuing as key batters miss out on time at the crease with the Ashes on the horizonEncouraging signs from Archer in his first ODI against New Zealand since the 2019 World Cup final as he finished with three wicketsRavindra's confident strokeplay backed up by excellent game awareness from Mitchell and SantnerMedia caption, 'There were promising signs' - Brook on NZ defeatEngland batting worries continueEngland were presented with an awkward green top at the Bay Oval in the first ODI and their rusty top order - Brook's majestic hundred aside - found it tough going.The surface at Seddon Park had a more appreciable straw-coloured hue, but the outcome for their Test contingent hoping to find form before they head across the Tasman Sea was similar.Admittedly, this capitulation was not quite as dramatic as the one at Mount Maunganui, with movement through the air and off the pitch not as pronounced.In the first powerplay here there was much less swing - 0.69 degrees versus 1.31 - and seam -  0.57 degrees versus 0.89 - compared to Sunday.England wickets nevertheless fell regularly through a combination of good bowling, bad luck and poor judgment.Ben Duckett nicked behind off a seaming delivery from Jacob Duffy for just a single as his lean trot from the end of the English summer continued.Fellow opener Smith perished on 13 when he skied one attempting to hit Zak Foulkes across the line.Root had reached 25 when he was frustrated to miss out on two deliveries from Tickner down leg side - neither of which were called wide - and ended up tickling the third to Tom Latham.At a parlous 51-3 England were vulnerable, but Bethell and Brook initially appeared assured only for things to unravel via a duff pull shot and slash to backward point on 18 and 34 respectively.Overton at least added a degree of competitiveness to the total although there were scant contributions from the remainder of the lower order as New Zealand ruthlessly closed the innings out.Are England's batting struggles in these first two ODIs an early portent for another southern hemisphere winter of discontent?Hopefully not for England fans. But opportunities for England's Test batters to spend time in the middle before the first Ashes Test in Perth on 21 November are quickly running out.Archer puts down a markerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jofra Archer had never played an ODI in New Zealand beforeEngland's 175 was some way short of the 244 average first-innings total in ODIs at Hamilton.Indeed it was over a hundred runs adrift of the average winning score - 287 - when batting first at the ground.Given so few runs to play with, England's bowlers needed to marry incisiveness with control.Archer brought them both during 10 overs of top-class fast bowling across two spells as he put down a marker in his first outing of the winter.The 30-year-old set the tone early with a full delivery in his first over that had Young trapped plumb in front.New Zealand's batters were then hopping about the crease, as Archer showed his teeth with some rasping short balls.Archer's pace was up there as well. He averaged 87.4mph across his two spells with his fastest delivery of the day clocked at 90.2mph.The Barbados-born quick bowler's two other wickets owed a little more to fortune - Ravindra hooking him to Adil Rashid in the deep and Bracewell feathering one off his pads into the gloves of wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.Yet they had been earned by spells of pressure. Archer's 51 dot balls were the most he has bowled in an ODI when he has sent down 10 overs.\"He is an awesome bowler,\" Brook said afterwards,\"Everyone loves watching him - 90mph and hoops it both ways. For him to bowl 3-23 is amazing. It is awesome to have him back.\" Archer's injury problems and careful management over the past few years have been well documented.But the fact he seems willing to throw himself about in the field - diving to stop balls on the boundary at fine leg - shows there are no scars. There will be no holding back this winter.England coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes will have excitedly taken note. So too, with a little more trepidation, will Australia.'Got to come back stronger' - reactionEngland captain Harry Brook: \"Disappointing to say the least. We have got to come back stronger and better and hopefully get at least one win against these boys who are second in the rankings.\"We want to go out and entertain the world. It was only two or three games ago we got 400 against South Africa. It is not far away. \"They are nice wickets to bat on. It is just trying to get through the first 15 or 20 balls of your innings. Hopefully we can have a good game on Saturday.\"New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner: \"It was a great game from us. The boys were exceptional.\"We knew it was going to be a challenging chase, especially with the likes of Brydon Carse and Jofra Archer. Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra did a hell of a job to get us through the powerplay.\"Player of the match, New Zealand fast bowler Blair Tickner: \"It felt really good, I didn't expect it, I just thought I was going to run some drinks. Last night I was having a BBQ and I saw a message. It's awesome to play.\"Taking early wickets is the way it goes. The boys up front did well and I just finished the job off.\"",

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

Media outlets and journalists risk sanctions and arrest for broaching sensitive topics and for criticising the government, while online content deemed to threaten Communist rule is blocked.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoIan Aikman and Elettra NeysmithMessages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers in 1916 have been found more than a century later on the country's south-western coast.The cheerful notes were penned just a few days into their voyage to join the battlefields of France during World War One. One of the soldiers, Pte Malcolm Neville, told his mother that the food on board was \"real good\" and that they were \"as happy as Larry\". Months later, he was killed in action at the age of 28. The other soldier, 37-year-old Pte William Harley, survived the war and returned home.The letters have been passed on to their descendants, who have been stunned by the discovery.The bottle was found earlier this month on the remote Wharton Beach, near Esperance in Western Australia, by local resident Deb Brown and her family.She was visiting the beach with her husband and daughter on one of their regular quad bike trips to clear up litter, when they spotted a thick glass bottle in the sand, she said on Tuesday.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Ms Brown told the Associated Press news agency.Though the paper was wet, both letters were still legible, so Ms Brown began tracking down the soldiers' families in order to pass them on.Ms Brown located Pte Neville's great-nephew, Herbie Neville, by searching for the soldier's name and the town he was from online, as his mother's address was included in the note.Mr Neville told ABC News the experience had been \"unbelievable\" for his family, especially for 101-year-old Marian Davies - Pte Neville's niece - who remembers her uncle leaving to go to war and never returning.The second letter, written by Pte William Harley, was addressed simply to whoever found the bottle. His mother had died years earlier.Pte Harley's granddaughter, Ann Turner, told ABC she and the soldier's four other surviving grandchildren were \"absolutely stunned\" by the message.\"It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" she said.\"I feel very emotional when I see that the other young man had a mother to write to, and that message in the bottle was to his mother, whereas our grandfather long ago had lost his mother so he just writes it to the finder of the bottle.\"The bottle was thrown overboard \"somewhere in the Bight\", Pte Harley's letter said, referring to the Great Australian Bight off the country's southern coast.An oceanography professor told ABC it may only have been in the water for a few weeks before it landed at Wharton Beach, where it may have remained buried for 100 years.",

    "body": "An 80-year-old Australian woman has been found dead on a Great Barrier Reef island after being left behind by the cruise ship she was travelling on.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found her body on Sunday morning. No details have been released.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating and would meet the ship's crew later this week.It is understood the woman, who has not been named, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.She had joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail newspaper.But she did not make it back to the ship, which then departed without her.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 on Sunday (18:00 GMT Saturday) with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was apparently found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 on Saturday by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Ms Ayris also said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"A report into the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman will be prepared for the coroner, Queensland police said.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff had contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Mr Fifield said.\"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" he added.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.The vessel has continued its voyage to Darwin.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHousebuilders have warned the government's budget watchdog that ministers' target of building 1.5 million homes in England by the end of the decade is too optimistic.The Home Builders Federation (HBF) has written to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to say that unless the government does something to boost affordability for first time buyers and cut taxes the target will be missed, as first reported in The Times. The letter is a blow to Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of next month's Budget, given that a surge in new homes is central to the OBR's forecasts for economic growth.The government says it will \"leave no stone unturned\" to meet the 1.5 million new homes target for England.The chancellor has promised to \"defy\" gloomy forecasts for the UK economy after it emerged the government is facing a bigger-than-expected hole in the public finances.The OBR is expected to downgrade productivity  - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - when it delivers its final draft forecast to the Treasury on Friday, ahead of Reeves' Budget on 26 November.The chancellor will be hoping that the warning from housebuilders will not drag the OBR's outlook down even further. The watchdog's decision in March to including the government's planning reforms in its economic forecasts was a major boost to Reeves, as it increased growth forecasts by 0.2% of GDP.The OBR did not endorse the 1.5 million target - but it did say that changes such as mandatory local housing targets and building on green belt land could result in 1.3 million homes across the entire UK over the next five years. But the Home Builders Federation is warning that this is an \"extremely ambitious\" target without further changes to government policy.The HBF is keen to stress that it welcomes the government's planning reforms - but it fears that these alone are not enough to kick start building in a flat market.The organisation, which says its members are responsible for building 80% of new homes in England and Wales, says there has been no government help for first time-buyers since the Help to Buy scheme closed to new applications in 2022.It has also criticised increases to the \"landfill tax\", which aims to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill sites, which it claims will add £14,000 to the cost of building a new home.The introduction of a new building safety levy next year will also add costs, it says. HBF spokesman Steve Turner said: \"Whilst the planning reforms overseen by ministers last year are very positive, government also continues to oversee increases in policy costs and taxes on new homes making many sites unviable. \"We need to see a reversal of these additional burdens and action to support first-time buyers in a market that they are increasingly frozen out of. \"It is the first time in decades there is no government support scheme in place to help people buy a home and the suppressed level of effective demand is preventing builders investing in sites to build the homes the country needs.\"Earlier this month, the government announced plans to shake up the house-buying system to speed up sales and save first-time buyers money.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government said: \"We will leave no stone unturned to build the 1.5 million homes this country desperately needs and restore the dream of homeownership.\"On top of the major planning changes we have already introduced to get developers building and our huge £39bn investment in social and affordable housing, we are going further and faster to accelerate reforms and bring about the biggest era of housebuilding in our country's history.\"",

    "body": "8 minutes agoDaniel Sandford,UK correspondent and Maia DaviesEssex PoliceHadush Kebatu was found guilty of two sexual assaults in Epping, where he had been living in a hotel housing migrantsA migrant sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison was given a £500 payment after threatening to disrupt his deportation from the UK to Ethiopia, the BBC understands.Hadush Kebatu was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping, Essex, but was mistakenly set free by prison staff on Friday. He was brought back into custody following a two-day manhunt.The Ethiopian national was put on a flight on Tuesday night and landed the following morning, the Home Office said.It is understood the decision to give the payment was made by the removal team and was considered an alternative to a more expensive and lengthier process. Kebatu was \"forcibly deported\" and accompanied by five escorts on the flight, sources said.Paid removals are normal under the Facilitated Returns Scheme, under which foreign nationals who agree to leave the UK are given £1,500.\"Forcible\" returns do not usually involve payments, but removal teams can decide to make a discretionary payment to ensure things go smoothly. In this case, the concern was that it would cost much more to re-book the flights - running into several thousands of pounds - and it might have led to expensive legal action.Sources said the payment made by the removal team, not ministers, avoided \"a slower and more expensive process, which would have included detention, a new flight and potentially fighting subsequent legal claims\".Kebatu arrived in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa early on Wednesday and was briefly held by officers at the airport, Ethiopian police told the BBC.He was then released because there was \"no legal basis for his continued detention\", Ethiopian Federal Police spokesman Jaylan Abde said.Announcing his removal earlier on Wednesday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Last week's blunder should never have happened - and I share the public's anger that it did.\"\"I have pulled every lever to deport Mr Kebatu and remove him off British soil. I am pleased to confirm this vile child sex offender has been deported. Our streets are safer because of it,\" she added. On Friday Kebatu was meant be taken from HMP Chelmsford to an immigration detention centre to be deported under an early removals scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders.Instead, he was released in what Justice Secretary David Lammy previously described as apparent \"human error\".By the time Essex Police were made aware of the situation shortly before 13:00, he had approached members of the public in the city centre for assistance and boarded a train to London.He was arrested in north London on Sunday morning after a member of the public contacted the police to say they might have spotted him near Finsbury Park station.Home Office Minister Alex Norris told BBC Breakfast the situation had \"ended in the way it had to end\".\"We accept this was a blunder - we're really angry about it as I know the public are.\"He said \"immediate controls\" had been put in place in prisons to avoid a repeat of the incident - including more \"stringent\" checks when offenders leave prisons for deportation - and that an independent inquiry would identify lessons learned.The independent investigation will seek to establish how Kebatu was set free and whether staff had sufficient experience, training and technology.The inquiry chair, former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens, will also speak to Kebatu's victims and make recommendations to prevent further mistaken releases, which have risen in recent years.An urgent review has been ordered into the checks that take place when someone is released from prison. A prison officer has been suspended and no removals from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS will take place this week.Epping Forest's Conservative MP, Neil Hudson, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the community would be \"very relieved\" by Kebatu's removal.\"No one wants to see our hometown the lead story on the news,\" he said, adding that the local authority's legal challenge to block migrants from lodging at The Bell Hotel - where Kebatu had been staying - was ongoing.\"The events over the weekend... have really brought things to the surface again,\" he said. \"This is incredibly frustrating and the government must get a grip.\"Kebatu arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel on a small boat on 29 June, having travelled through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France.His arrest in July sparked a wave of protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, which was being used to accommodate asylum seekers including Kebatu.Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu had tried to kiss a teenage girl in the town centre, making sexually explicit comments to her.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her and another woman.He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already spent in jail awaiting his trial.A deportation order must be made when a foreign national is sentenced to 12 months or more in custody, under the UK Borders Act 2007.During Kebatu's trial, the court heard it was his \"firm wish\" to be deported.",

    "body": "49 minutes agoKoh Ewe,Singapore and Kathryn Armstrong,LondonGetty ImagesThe meeting comes as both countries are still trying to reach a trade dealThe US and South Korea have reached a broad trade deal, both countries have said following talks between their leaders. South Korea's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, said the two sides will keep reciprocal tariffs at 15%, as was agreed earlier this year, but that the taxes on car and car parts would be lowered. South Korea will also invest $350bn in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding, Kim said. US President Donald Trump, who is currently on a week-long trip in Asia, said the deal was \"pretty much finalised\" at a dinner following the discussions, which lasted almost two hours. He did not give further details. \"We had a tremendous meeting today with South Korea\", Trump said, adding that \"a lot was determined\".\"We discussed some other things to do with national security et cetera. And I think we came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"Both sides had played down the prospect of a breakthrough ahead of Wednesday's talks - disappointing many in South Korea's electronics, chip and auto industries, which had been hoping for some clarity amidst the tariff chaos. Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which South Korean President Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas.But the White House later increase its demands as part of the trade talks, with Trump pushing for cash investments in the US.Both countries have historically been key allies - but tensions spiked after hundreds of South Koreans were detained in an immigration raid in the US last month.Caught in the middle, South Korea hosts rival superpowersTrump will next meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in on Thursday on the sidelines of a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) which is taking place in Gyeongju.China's foreign ministry has confirmed the meeting, which will take place in the city of Busan on Thursday, a short flight away from Gyeongju. The US president said on Wednesday that he was \"looking forward\" to the meeting.\"We've been talking a lot over the last month and I think we're going to have something that's gonna be very, very satisfactory to China and to us.\"This will be the two leaders' first face to face meeting since Trump assumed office in 2025 and imposed tariffs on every country in the world.Addressing a group of CEOs in Gyeongju on Wednesday, Trump said that he believes the US is \"going to have a deal\" with China and it will be \"a good deal for both\".He also praised the Apec countries for making the global trading system, which he said had been \"broken\" and \"in urgent need of reform\", fairer.\"Economic security is national security,\" Trump says. \"That's for South Korea, that's for any country.\"Golden crowns and grand ordersAhead of Wednesday's talks with President Lee, Trump had been greeted by an honour guard and gifts that included a golden crown. \"I'd like to wear it right now,\" Trump had said of the crown. He also received the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decoration.He's the first US president to receive the award, which was given \"in recognition of his contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula\", the South Korean presidential office said.Both leaders took part in a working lunch - which was followed by a private meeting in the afternoon. ReutersThe US president was gifted a golden crown and the Grand Order of Mugunghwa, South Korea's highest decorationTrump's arrival in South Korea had been preceded by North Korea test-firing surface-to-air cruise missiles.The US president had expressed interest in meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un but noted on Wednesday that his team had been unable to arrange this during his trip.Noting the long-standing tensions between North and South Korea, Trump said \"we will see what we can do to get that all straightened out\".And outside the summit venue where both leaders were meeting, a small anti-Trump group of protesters gathered on Wednesday afternoon, with some shouting anti-Trump slogans. Police could be seen forcibly dispersing the crowd and arresting some people.However, hundreds more attended a pro-Trump rally - including those who shouted anti-Chinese rhetoric  - also took places close to the summit venue. Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has also grown steadily in recent years. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about former South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol.BBC/Leehyun ChoiDozens of people attended a protest outside the Gyeongju National Museum on WednesdayDuring his trip to Japan on Tuesday, the US president signed an agreement on rare earth minerals with Tokyo, as well as a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations. This reiterated the commitment of the two countries to implement deals struck earlier, including the 15% tariff deal negotiated earlier this year.Prior to that, he attended a gathering of South East Asian leaders, known as Asean, in Malaysia. There he presided over a \"peace deal\" between Thailand and Cambodia, whose longstanding border dispute erupted into open conflict in July.With additional reporting by Laura Bicker, China Correspondent and Suranjana Tewari, Asia Business Correspondent",

    "body": "5 hours agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondentAFP via Getty ImagesGeert Wilders is facing a strong challenge from left-leader Frans Timmermans and liberal Rob JettenGeert Wilders' anti-Islam Freedom party is facing a tight race in Wednesday's Dutch election, and even if he wins the vote his hopes of forming a new government appear minimal.Wilders was the clear winner last time Dutch voters went to the polls in November 2023, but final opinion polls ahead of voting suggest a fall in his support.Dutch voters are grappling with a series of crises, from a chronic housing shortage to overcrowded asylum centres. The cost of living is rising with sky-high rents and healthcare costs.Unlike last time, Wilders' rivals are refusing to work with him after he brought down his own coalition government last June.Voting at most of the country's more than 10,000 polling stations continues until 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Wednesday.Commentators believe it is more important who comes second in the vote than first, as it could decide who will form the next government.Even if Wilders' party comes top, the next Dutch government is more likely to come from the centre left or centre right.The race is wide open, and more than a third of Dutch voters were seen as undecided on the eve of the election.\"It's one of the most important elections, because people need to have their faith restored,\" says Sarah de Lange, professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.As many as 15 parties are set to win a share of parliament's 150 seats, but opinion polls suggest four will stand out. Apart from Wilders' PVV, there is GreenLeft-Labour under ex-EU top official Frans Timmermans, Rob Jetten's liberal D66 and the centre-right Christian Democrats of Henri Bontenbal.For almost half of Dutch voters, the housing crisis is top priority, with a shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Housing has taken stage in the election, and although Wilders has blamed the crisis on migration, others point to a rise in single-person households and planning gridlock.Most of the parties have vowed to tackle the issue head-on. Frans Timmermans promises at least 100,000 new homes per year if his party takes office, while Rob Jetten of the liberals says the solution lies on building on 1% of agricultural land.Unemployment hit 4% last month, which is low in European terms but the highest rate for four years in the Netherlands. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose 8.8% over the past year, signalling growing anxiety among workers about job security.EPA/ShuttlestockLiberal-conservative leader Dilan Yesilgöz labels Wilders' party \"one man with a Twitter account\"Considered for so long the outsider of Dutch politics, Geert Wilders played a key role in the last government, both in setting it up and in bringing it down after only 11 months, in a row over immigration. His coalition partners refused to let him become prime minister, but having former spy chief Dick Schoof lead a technocrat cabinet was a workaround that ultimately failed.Former coalition partner Dilan Yesilgöz, the leader of the conservative-liberal VVD, told Wilders his \"party exists as one man with a Twitter account and nothing more\".Pierre Crom/Getty ImagesWilders' lead in the polls narrowed in the weeks leading up to the electionYesilgöz's jibe was not completely out of place as Wilders does not allow his PVV to have members. Yesilgöz's own VVD party is polling down in fifth place.Wilders was on the backfoot ahead of the vote, having to apologise to Frans Timmermans after two Freedom party MPs posted AI-generated images of the left-wing leader being led away in handcuffs.When Wilders won two years ago, Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam says he was able to harness the votes of more radical voters on the right who were worried about Islam and Eurosceptic along with less radical voters.\"People called him Milders, a milder version of himself,\" says Prof Rooduijn, who points out that Wilders then put on ice many of his anti-Islam policies to appear more palatable.Although Wilders no longer talks of banning mosques and the Koran, he sees Islam as \"the greatest existential threat to our freedom\", a view Prof Rooduijn describes as \"really a key element of his nativism - an exclusionary form of nationalism\".In one TV debate, Wilders said \"take a walk [in central Rotterdam] on shopping night on Saturday evening and it's like you're in Marrakesh; it's not the Netherlands any more\".Left-wing leader Timmermans has accused him of scapegoating an entire section of society: \"You're blaming Islam.\"But the risk Wilders faces now is of losing both the more radical voters, if they fail to turn out, and the less radical voters who could drift to other parties, including the anti-immigration Ja21.\"Right now I don't think it's very likely Wilders will be part of a government coalition,\" Prof Rooduijn believes.It can take weeks - if not months - for parties to form a coalition, but if the centre right takes power, Christian Democrat Henri Bontenbal could be in the frame to lead it.His CDA party has staged a remarkable comeback in that only two years ago they won just five seats.Bontenbal believes Dutch voters are looking now at a return to \"what I'll call 'boring politics'. The Netherlands is done with populism\".He has not had a great campaign, though. Days after he defended the right of religious schools to teach that homosexual relationships were wrong, he went back on himself and admitted he had made a mistake.",

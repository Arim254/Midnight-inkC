Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.While formal identification is yet to take place, police said they believed this person to be Grace. The discovery was made on Thursday but her body was unable to be recovered due to tide times and conditions.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"This was a deeply upsetting incident, and I cannot begin to understand the heartbreak felt by all the loved ones of those involved.\"Vickers said they had spoken to Grace's family and updated them, and were continuing to support them with specially trained officers.\"Understandably, they have asked for their privacy, and we would ask that this is respected,\" he said.Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaPolice said her body was discovered at about 08:30 GMT on Thursday on the rocks at Withernsea beach, following extensive searches over the past 14 days. They added that \"despite every effort it was not possible to safely recover Grace before high tide yesterday\".Officers said they were able to recover her body on Saturday morning with the help of HM Coastguard and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.Humberside Police thanked everyone who had offered or assisted in the search.Vickers added: \"Our thoughts and sincere sympathies will always remain with the families of Grace and Sarah Keeling, and Mark Ratcliffe following this utter tragedy.\"Police had previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".Family HandoutMark Ratcliffe was described by his family as a \"selfless hero\"A major operation was launched at 15:10 GMT following reports of people in the water. It involved HM Coastguard, emergency services, the RNLI and included helicopters and lifeboats.Ratcliffe, from Withernsea, was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. In a tribute, his family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".The body of Sarah Keeling, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, was recovered later the same evening.Her close friend Joanne Gee said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".An inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January and adjourned to a later date.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Fourteen people have been arrested and four people taken to hospital after a protest outside the Iranian embassy in London.One protester climbed across balconies to reach the embassy's terraces and remove a flag before being detained on Friday night, police said.A further 13 were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault of an emergency worker, criminal damage and trespass on diplomatic premises.Demonstrations have been taking place outside the embassy amid widespread anti-government protests in Iran, where thousands have been killed in the unrest.The Metropolitan Police said objects had been thrown at police during the protest and that four officers had sustained minor injuries, though none were believed to have been taken to hospital. The man who removed the flag was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, trespass on diplomatic property and assaulting police, the Met said. He remains in custody. The force added that a group of protesters had attempted to prevent his lawful arrest and dispersal tactics were used by officers \"to ensure the safety of those concerned and prevent further disorder\".A section 35 dispersal order was imposed outside the embassy \"as a result of ongoing disorder\", it added.A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said it was called to reports of an incident at the junction of Exhibition Road and Kensington Road - near where the Iranian embassy and a number of other embassies are located - at around 20:45 GMT on Friday.Four people were taken to hospital while two others were treated at the scene, they added.Earlier this week, the Iranian ambassador in London was summoned to the Foreign Office after a number of protesters in Iran were killed. Last Saturday, two people were arrested at a protest outside the embassy in which a demonstrator also climbed onto the building's balcony and appeared to tear down the Iranian flag. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", during recent protests.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed and blamed the US for the deaths.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents. The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer. Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and \"using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity\".The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from \"stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering\" with their work. \"The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,\" it says. In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters\".The White House also criticised the ruling.\"This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,\" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. \"Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.\"Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city. There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.Additionally on Friday, the justice department  announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.\"A reminder to all those in Minnesota:  No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey. \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,\" Walz said in a statement.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAmy WalkerAndrea BradyJessica Brady contacted her GP practice more than 20 times feeling unwellA new system urging doctors to \"think again\" if they are unable to pin down a diagnosis after seeing a patient three times - named Jess's Rule - is to be advertised in every GP surgery in England from next week. The NHS initiative is named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced stage four cancer in 2020 aged 27.Before her eventual diagnosis, Jess had contacted her GP on more than 20 occasions after feeling unwell, but was told her symptoms were related to long Covid and that she was \"too young for cancer\".Her mother, Andrea Brady, welcomed the government rollout of the posters. She told BBC Breakfast: \"We still need to trust our doctors but trust ourselves as well.\"Under the patient safety initiative, GPs are asked to take a \"fresh eyes\" approach if they have been unable to offer a patient a substantiated diagnosis or their symptoms have escalated after three appointments.Jess, an engineer at Airbus, became ill in June 2020. Andrea said her family initially assumed it was something minor, \"but that wasn't what happened for Jess\".Her symptoms, which included unexplained weight loss, night sweats and vomiting, then worsened. \"It was very, very painful... to see the impact on Jess not just physically but the toll it was taking on her mentally,\" said Andrea.Jess had contact with six different doctors at her GP surgery and three face-to-face consultations with a family doctor, but no referral to a specialist was made.Her family then arranged a private appointment and she was referred to a specialist,   who gave Jess a terminal cancer diagnosis of adenocarcinoma - cancer of the glands that line the organs - in November.She died three weeks later, just days before Christmas 2020.Andrea said her daughter was \"trying to be really resilient and advocate for herself\" before her diagnosisThe government said the consultation room posters would improve patient safety by prompting doctors to \"revisit patient records, challenge initial assumptions and remain alert to warning signs that might otherwise be missed\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Every patient deserves to be heard, and every serious illness deserves to be caught early. \"Jess's Rule makes that possible - reminding clinicians to take a fresh look when symptoms persist, and empowering patients to speak up about their care.\"Andrea said the family wanted to follow what Jess had \"really wanted to start when she was diagnosed, which was to create some positive change\".\"It's taken five years but to know now that Jess's rule is out there and happening and is being received really positively and proactively by primary care colleagues is really, really important,\" she added.She said the rule was a \"two-way thing\" intended to benefit both patients and GPs.The posters were designed by Jess's parents Andrea and Simon in partnership with NHS England and the Department of Health, and funded by the Jessica Brady Cedar Trust established in her honour.Dr Claire Fuller, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"Encouraging GP teams to challenge a diagnosis when it matters most could save lives by avoiding missed or late diagnoses.\"",

    "body": "Justice Secretary David Lammy has blocked the transfer to an open prison of a killer accused of releasing rap music about murdering 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen.Jake Fahri was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 14 years in 2009 for killing the teenager by throwing an oven dish at him in south London. The dish shattered, severing blood vessels in his neck.Fahri was released on licence in 2023 but recalled by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) last January after the Sun published a story alleging he was making drill music -including about the murder - as balaclava-clad artist Ten.The Parole Board said earlier this month that he should be moved to an open prison, but that has now been blocked.An MoJ spokesman said Deputy Prime Minister Lammy's intervention was for \"public protection\".The Parole Board said in its decision summary earlier this month that Fahri, 36, had given evidence disputing his music was \"about his own life\" but noted that since his recall he had accepted that he was the artist Ten.It said his failure to disclose the music to his probation officer had been a breach of his licence, but Fahri had claimed to have been unaware of the restrictions - something the panel found to be untrue.The board had rejected the possibility of releasing Fahri again, instead recommending his move to an open prison. It added that Farhi \"needed to reflect\" on \"why he failed to be open and honest with the professionals managing his case\" but this \"could be achieved\" in an open prison.Lammy's blocking of this move has been welcomed by Mizen's mother Margaret, who told the Sun she had been \"shocked\" by the Parole Board's initial recommendation.\"I would much prefer this decision didn't have to be made because [Fahri] would have turned his life around. I'm really sad that he hasn't,\" she said.But the reversal showed Farhi had \"not changed his attitude\", she added.\"He got into the witness box at his trial and lied through his teeth,\" she told the newspaper. \"Clearly, he hasn't changed, and I'm glad the justice secretary has seen through it.\"When he was sentenced for the May 2008 murder, Farhi had been given a minimum 14-year prison term - the point at which release can be considered, usually with conditions attached.Two songs by Ten were played on BBC 1Xtra. The BBC said it had been unaware of his background at the time of broadcast. ",

It has now been deleted.The video, which was shared on Instagram and X on Friday, opened with a close-up image of feet suspended in the air, before showing the duo pegged to a washing line.Former X Factor contestant and mental health advocate Katie Waissel described the video as \"triggering, insensitive and frankly reckless to push out as 'entertainment'\".\"This opening visual of feet suspended above the ground is not a harmless 'play on words',\" she wrote, adding: \"The suicide imagery is impossible to ignore.\"Other social media users called the clip \"insensitive\", \"triggering\" and in \"poor taste\". Ant and Dec said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"taken on board comments\" and deleted the video.The podcast will see the duo catch up about their lives as well as taking questions and comments from listeners.It is part of their new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as \"new digital formats\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "The Syrian army is moving into areas east of Aleppo city, after Kurdish forces started a withdrawal.Syrian troops have been spotted entering Deir Hafer, a town about 50km (30 miles) from Aleppo.On Friday, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates river. This follows talks with US officials, and a pledge from Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to make Kurdish a national language.After deadly clashes last week, the US urged both sides to avoid a confrontation. President al-Sharaa is seeking to integrate the Kurds' military and civilian bodies into Syrian national institutions.In a statement to state-run news agency Sana, the Syrian army said its forces \"began entering the western Euphrates area\", and declared it had established \"full military control\" of Deir Hafer.The military urged civilians not to enter the operations area until it is secured and \"cleared it of all mines and war remnants\".Images showed Syrian forces advancing towards the area, including with tanks.The move comes after Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi agreed to pull back his US-backed SDF \"towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates\", responding to \"calls from friendly countries and mediators\".US special envoy Tom Barrack and Mazloum Abdi are set to meet later on Saturday in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.In recent days, the Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.Before the Kurdish withdrawal, President al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language, and recognise the Kurdish new year as an official holiday.The decree, announced on Friday, is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. It stated that Kurds were \"an essential and integral part\" of Syria, where they have endured decades of oppression under previous rulers.Despite the apparent easing of tensions, disagreements linger. In response to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria's north and north-east said it was \"a first step\" but called for \"permanent constitutions that express the will of the people\", rather than \"temporary decrees\".Both sides have accused each other of violating the terms of the agreement. Syria's army said two of its soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces as the military moved in, while the SDF accused Damascus of sending troops in early. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.Following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate the Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each sides blaming the other.",

The way that he behaved in that moment when his mum really needed him and other road users needed him was absolutely amazing.\"I was so impressed with what Zac did and I just wanted to make sure that we gave him a treat to recognise that.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Rival chip shop-owning brothers call each night 'to see who's taken the most'2 days agoAngela FergusonBBC WalesLeanne JonesThe brothers said they were \"proud\" of the work the other had doneTwo brothers who both run award-winning fish and chip shops have spoken of the \"healthy\" rivalry they enjoy, saying they \"ring each other every night and see who's taken the most\".Ouday Hikary, 43, runs Hikary's Fish Bar in Neath, Neath Port Talbot, while his older brother Emir Hikary, 46, runs Hiks, which is just 10 miles (17km) away in Swansea.Both businesses have been named in the 2026 top 50 takeaways in the UK, which is put together by fish and chip shop industry trade publication Fry Magazine.The brothers said they were \"proud\" of the work the other had done.Emir first got into the industry after being made redundant from his job in a call centre, using his redundancy money to buy a van and sell fish and chips opposite Ouday's pub in Swansea. When the pub closed, the brothers opened Hiks together out of the same building in 2010, and a year later Ouday branched out by opening his own fish and chip shop in Neath.Leanne JonesOuday Hikary opened his business in Neath back in 2011He went on to win the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Awards in 2016.\"He's my brother and I'm so proud of what he has achieved and if he does really well I'll be the first one to cheer him and be his biggest fan,\" Emir, who has five children,  told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, to which Ouday responded: \"I'm so proud of you.\"Leanne JonesOuday and Emir Hikary's businesses have both been named in the top 50 UK takeawaysRunning the business is a family affair for father-of-four Ouday, with his wife Kasia doing admin for the business and three of his children also helping out.He said he loved running his fish and chip shop as \"every day is different\" and he enjoyed the banter with the customers and being part of the community.Ouday said it was good to have won the award during what was a challenging time to run such a business, with the high cost of fish, coupled with factors such as the cost of living crisis.Emir said: \"We haven't had things handed on a plate to us. \"We worked together when we first started off and we have to work really hard.\"He said he was \"very happy\" that he and his brother had won the awards adding they were proud of their staff for the key role they played in the win.Leanne JonesHikary's Fish Bar in Neath has won a number of awardsThe brothers will receive a plaque which they plan to put in pride of place above the range in their respective shops.Emir said they wanted to thank fellow fish and chip shop owners at the Roma Fish Bar in Gorseinon, Swansea, saying they had supported them right from the beginning and \"they have always been there for us\".Both businesses have been previous winners in the top 50 UK takeaways awards, with Hiks also reaching the finals of the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Shop Awards in 2020.More top stories",

    "body": "Thousands of people in Greenland and Denmark have protested against plans by US President Donald Trump to take over Greenland - an autonomous Danish territory.Demonstrations were held in Danish cities including the capital, Copenhagen, as well as in Greenland's capital, Nuuk.The rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".Mr Trump has not ruled out taking Greenland, which he insists is critical for America's national security, by force - and has now announced he will impose tariffs European countries that are opposed to his plan. Goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland will be subject to a 10% US tariff from 1 February, he wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday.Accusing these countries of playing \"a very dangerous game\", he said the tariffs would be raised to 25% on 1 June \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\".Join our live updates Greenland is sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has previously said Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\" - an apparent reference to buying the island or taking it by force.In Copenhagan on Saturday, placards were held up reading: \"Hands Off Greenland\" and \"Greenland for Greenlanders\".\"It's very important that we stay together and show that Greenland is not for sale and we would not like to be an American or won't be annexed by the USA,\" Greenlandic politician Erik Jensen told the Reuters news agency.Saturday's protests are organised by Greenlandic and Danish NGOs.  \"We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination,\" said Camilla Siezing, heads of Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations. In Nuuk, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined protesters holding signs reading \"Greenland is not for sale\" and \"we shape our future\" as they headed for the US consulate. Opinion polls suggest 85% of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the US.Other European countries have rallied to Denmark's support, arguing that the security of the Arctic region should be a joint Nato responsibility.France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have dispatched a small number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.Many in the US have expressed scepticism about acquiring Greenland. Most of the Congressional delegation visiting Denmark are Democrats, but the 11-member team also includes moderate Republicans.\"There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners,\" said Coons.",

    "body": "20 hours agoPhilippa Roxby and Jim ReedHealth reportersGetty ImagesTaking paracetamol while pregnant is safe and there's no evidence it raises the risk of autism, ADHD and developmental issues in children, say experts behind a major new review.Pregnant women \"should feel reassured\" by the findings, they say, which contradict controversial claims from US President Donald Trump last year that paracetamol \"is no good\" and pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" not to take it.His views were criticised at the time by medical organisations worldwide. Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Women's Health, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.Getty ImagesIn a speech in September 2025, President Trump said his administration was linking paracetamol (or acetaminophen) to autism and urging pregnant women to largely avoid the pain relieverA spokesman from the US Department of Health and Human Services said \"many experts\" had expressed concern over the use of acetaminophen - the US name for paracetamol - during pregnancy.For example, a review in August 2025 led by Dr Andrew Baccarelli, dean of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, found that using acetaminophen during pregnancy may increase children's autism and ADHD risk, and urged caution over \"especially heavy or prolonged use\".Months earlier, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had pledged to find out the cause of a steep rise in reported autism cases.In a controversial speech in the Oval Office in September, the US president said doctors would be advised not to prescribe the pain reliever to pregnant women. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) then issued a letter to clinicians urging them to be cautious about the use of acetaminophen in pregnancy, while also saying it was still the only drug approved for treating fevers during pregnancy.On its website, the FDA says \"a causal relationship\" between the drug and neurological conditions \"has not been established\". Health officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.",

    "body": "8 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorReutersShoppers on Oxford Street during the Boxing Day salesA new year, a new beginning.The latest monthly figures on the economy hardly confirm a change of gear, but nor do they back up the worst doom-mongers claiming decline and recession. It is neither doom nor boom, but a new year makes an opportunity to wipe the slate clean on policy, on a sense of certainty, and perhaps above all, the vibes in the economy.There is one chart that might explain quite a lot about both the state of and the prospects for the UK economy. And it might say a fair bit about the political direction of the UK too.It is consumer confidence. These are the long-running surveys that essentially put the nation on the economic psychiatric couch.  How do you feel about the economy's prospects? Are you likely to buy a major piece of equipment? How are your personal finances?There is a solid data source of consistently asked questions going back five decades - it is the measure now called the GfK Consumer Confidence Barometer.I've been reporting on this metric for half of its existence. It's an imperfect science but the basic idea to reach the net confidence number is the optimism score minus the pessimism score.The patterns then were interesting and consistent. And it was important as a predictor for those in power to stay in power. \"It's the Economy Stupid\", remember.But has something significant changed in the water? This chart is quite extraordinary and a version of it has been circulated at the top of government.A quick narration is in order.This chart breaks down the headline net confidence number by age cohort.Broadly speaking they used to move together, they were \"correlated\". Younger people have a generally sunnier starting point but that dims as they age - not a great surprise - and all age groups react to events similarly. Over the past decade you can see correlated declines in consumer confidence across all age groups in reaction to the post-Brexit vote era and the impact of the pandemic. The clear impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the extraordinary rise in energy prices can be seen.An interesting takeaway is how devastating the Liz Truss mini-budget in 2022 was for all age groups. A loss of confidence in the 45-day government and in economic prospects.And up until 2024 all those lines move in tandem.But what happens in late 2024? Divergence. Big time.The under-50s' consumer confidence goes higher, and soars for the under-30s to highs not seen since Brexit. But take a look at the bottom two red lines. Over-50s' and over-60s' consumer confidence collapses toward Truss-era levels.How can it be that the over 50s, and pensioners in particular, are living through another collapse in economic confidence, and yet the young adult population is much more positive?Well the dotted line is the 2024 General Election. And while correlation does not mean causation, that is when this age-related break occurs.Votes affecting vibesA possible explanation from political economy is this - the flow of causality from economic sentiment to political sentiment has reversed.Where how you felt about your finances influenced how you voted, now how you voted influences how you feel about your finances and the economic outlook for the country.Young people broadly on the liberal left are now happier after enduring a rolling series of crises so far this decade, and with a government they largely voted for in 2024.The older, who voted Conservative and Reform predominantly, are unhappy and unconvinced. They think the country has gone to the dogs even more than usual.One possible factor is the tone set by social media and the emotive doom-scrolling and rage magnets embodied in their algorithms. Is this demographic seeing the Mad Max-style dystopia presented on their social media feeds and responding with this negative outlook?There is also some evidence in the US of respondents to one consumer sentiment survey exhibiting a political tint on their sense of economic confidence. In the transition between the Donald Trump and Joe Biden administrations at the end of 2020, Democrats respondents' economic confidence surged from 67 to 96, while Republicans' crashed from 100 to 59. The Biden administration then bemoaned what staffers called the \"Vibecession\" - the subsequent sense of economic malaise not really reflected in good economic numbers.Rates a double-edged swordThere are other economic factors at play. This rebound in confidence for the young coincides with when the Bank of England started cutting interest rates. Rate cuts are good for young home seekers and jobseekers, but bad for older savers.There are significant economic consequences if this picture is correct too. It might help explain the curiously high and nearly double-digit UK savings rate. That looks like a pandemic-style aberration. Older Britain is sat on its savings, despondent about the country and the economy, refusing to spend its money and weighing down GDP, even as pay rises for workers remain higher on average than the rate of inflation.The takeaways from this chart are also well-reflected in the early financial results we are getting from businesses.Many retail results have defied the gloom. Some bosses that complain the most about National Insurance rises seem to be reporting healthy sales and profits having basically paid for the tax. Pub chain Mitchells & Butlers \"traded very strongly across the festive season with like-for-like growth of 7.7%\". Fullers had an \"outstanding five-week Christmas and New Year season across all parts of the estate\", 8% up on an already strong festive period last year.Obviously challenges remain in the level of price rises. But inflation is on its way down to the 2% target, with a conscious attempt from government to limit regulated price rises for rail and water.More rate cuts will come slowly, and the impact of previous cuts will also filter into the household sector.A mortgage price war may be on its way to help a housing market rebound after months of Budget uncertainty. The government will hope to draw a line under a tumultuous 2025, with what they hope is an investment boom typified by recent announcements on Heathrow and on a new northern train line.So there's a platform to defy the doom. But could people's now politically charged perceptions of economic confidence be a brake on all that?",

    "body": "Is fibre the new protein? The surprising health benefits of the latest wellness trend20 hours agoRuth Clegg,Health and wellbeing reporter andGrace DeanNatalia Gdovskaia/Getty ImagesFibre has been trending on social media, with creators sharing recipes using ingredients like chickpeas, avocado and nutsLast year, many of us went protein-mad in the hopes of boosting our strength and fitness. But over the past few months, fibre - something very few of us get enough of every day - has become the hot topic on social media.Posts with the hashtags #fibremaxxing and #fibermaxxing have been viewed more than 150m times on TikTok, and videos of chia seeds being sprinkled on porridge and nutritionists lauding the benefits of red kidney beans and chickpeas are all over people's feeds.The NHS recommends adults eat 30g of fibre a day, but 96% of us in the UK are not hitting that benchmark - and we aren't even close. Average daily consumption is around 16.4g, with women eating less than men.Many nutritionists say the buzz over fibre isn't a bad thing. According to dietitian Kate Hilton, fibre has long been viewed as an \"unsexy nutrient\" due to its associations with digestion and flatulence, in contrast with protein's longstanding link to fitness and exercise.\"When I first saw all the posts on fibre, I was pretty thrilled,\" says nutritionist Kristen Stavridis. \"It feels like the messages around gut health are finally getting through to people.\"As well as benefitting your gut, eating more fibrous food - like brown rice and jacket potatoes - has other benefits too.\"People who have a higher fibre intake will live longer, have less cardiovascular disease, fewer cancers and are at a lower risk of conditions like diabetes,\" says Kevin Whelan, professor of Dietetics at King's College London. He adds that some studies suggest it can help our mental health, too.Yeshe Sander, 24, from Birmingham, says upping the fibre in her diet to 30g a day has helped her feel \"so much better\" physically and mentally.She grew up with parents who tried to get her to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and have a fibre-rich diet but, as she entered her mid-teens, she decided to rebel.\"I wanted nothing to do with healthy food,\" Yeshe says. \"As a teenager, I would eat huge amounts of chocolate, doughnuts, cookies.\"At college, her favourite quick meals included instant noodles with white toast or frozen pizza.\"It was only when I got a bit older, in my early 20s, that I thought maybe they were onto something,\" Yeshe says of her parents.After feeling sluggish, low and lacking motivation, she re-examined her diet and started to eat more healthily again. After increasing her fibre intake, Yeshe noticed the difference.Yeshe SanderYeshe and her porridge, topped with chia seeds, ground flaxseed, plant milk, apple, kiwi, pumpkin seeds, cinnamon, walnuts, peanut butter and some honey\"Now I can see it so clearly: when I'm eating more fibre, my mental health gets better,\" Yeshe says, \"and my anxiety and low mood is reduced.\"Breakfast is her favourite meal and she recommends eating porridge with a variety of toppings as a way to get some fibre in the morning.What is fibre and why is it so important for our diet?Dietary fibre is a chain of sugar molecules produced by plants that cannot be digested by humans. It is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and nuts.The effects of fibre were first discovered in the 1970s, when it was believed that fibre was just \"hard roughage stuff\" that helped our bodies get rid of waste, explains Whelan. \"Now we know it's so much more than that - it has health benefits way beyond the bowel.\"Fermentable fibres in foods like oats and legumes help the good bacteria in our large intestine grow, enriching our gut microbiome.Insoluble fibres, found in wholegrain bread, bran and the skins of fruit and vegetables, help our poo travel through the gut.Viscous fibres, found in oats, seeds and some fruits and vegetables, slow down the speed sugar is absorbed and reduce sugar spikes in the bloodstream.All these different types of fibre, among others, help keep us healthy, Whelan says.Getty ImagesFibre is found in fruits, vegetables, grains, beans and nutsWhen speaking about the health benefits of fibre consumption, Whelan points to numerous large-scale epidemiological studies, which record a large group of people's eating habits alongside which diseases they go on to develop.While these studies don't always take into account other factors – like demographics, environment, awareness of diet – he says there are also clinical trials that suggest fibre has health benefits for many parts of the body.Some studies also suggest a high-fibre diet can help improve mental health, says Whelan. A healthy microbiome, fed with prebiotic fibre that boosts health bacteria in the gut, can potentially reduce anxiety and depression risk.\"There is a two-way communication between our brain and our gut, the gut-brain axis,\" he says. Clinical trials suggest certain fibres – prebiotic fibres that feed the microbiome – can help improve mood.One surprising finding from Whelan's research was that fibre helped improve cognition in people over 60.'My skin's better, I've got more energy'Vicky Owens says boosting her fibre intake after a health scare last year has had huge benefits.As a business owner with little time to devote to cooking, her diet mainly consisted of takeaways and ready meals.Vicky EvansVicky says her new diet has helped her skin and energy levelsThen the 25-year-old started experiencing unexplained symptoms including panic attacks, gastric issues and swollen, itchy eyes, which, she says, baffled her doctor.She began to re-evaluate her lifestyle and after an acupuncturist suggested she shake up her diet, it dawned on Vicky she was eating next to no fibre.She began to cut out ultra-processed foods, instead opting for fresh fruit and vegetables, whole wheat pastas and oats.Eventually, she started to see huge benefits.\"My skin's better, I've got more energy,\" Vicky says, \"and I think as a whole everything's so much more balanced now.\"How to add more fibre to your dietSmall switches are a great way to add more fibre to your meals, says dietitian Hilton. Here are some ideas how to do that:Replace white bread with seeded wholegrain breadSwap snacks like crisps and chocolate for almonds, kiwis and popcornAdd seeds, nuts, fruit or almond butter to your porridge or yogurtChange white rice for brown or wholegrain rice, or go half and halfAdd avocado, hummus or salad to your sandwichIf you like to start your day with cereal, go for something like wheat biscuits, bran flakes or bran sticksSome typical fibre-rich foods Here's a sample meal plan from Stavridis on how you can hit 30g fibre in a day (note that fibre quantities vary by brand and portion size):Breakfast: Two slices of thick seeded wholemeal toast (7g fibre), with a sliced banana (1.5g fibre) and honeyLunch: Baked potato (5g fibre), 100g of baked beans (4g fibre), cheese, tuna, side salad of mixed leaves, followed by one kiwi (2g fibre)Snack: One serving (20g) of popcorn (2g fibre)Dinner: Beef mince bolognese with kidney beans (5g) and whole wheat spaghetti (6.5g)People in the UK eat a lot of convenience and ultra-processed foods, which don't typically contain much fibre, says Hilton.\"The carbohydrates that we consume tend to not be things like whole grains and we have a lot more of a reliance on things like meats to get our proteins, rather than beans or vegetarian sources,\" she adds.Stavridis points out that the recent fixation on protein may have affected some people's fibre intake too, as some people prioritised it at the cost of other nutrients.Though protein is important for our health, she says people should stop \"obsessing over protein and start tracking fibre\" and ensure they're getting a healthy diet overall.While eating more fibre is a good thing for most people, for some with conditions like Crohn's disease and diverticulitis, it is often not recommended and medical advice should be sought before any dietary changes.Too much too fast can also cause problems, explains Cara Wheatley-McGrain from the Mindful Gut, a wellbeing company which supports people to change their diets.\"Increase slowly - if we suddenly make a dramatic change, our gut goes 'hang on a minute', and we can end up with bloating and constipation.\"And make sure to drink plenty of water, she recommends.While Wheatley-McGrain is \"really happy\" fibre is finally being taken seriously on socials, she does not want to add additional pressure on young people who are constantly met with a barrage of different diets and eating regimes.\"We need to navigate that to make the best choices for ourselves,\" she says. \"Add some fibre to your diet slowly, notice how it feels and take it from there.\"More weekend picks",

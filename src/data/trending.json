    "body": "Thieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables, police have said.A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\".During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery. Gelsenkirchen Police said they became aware of the crime after a fire alarm was set off in the early hours of Monday morning.Currently, no arrests have been made and the perpetrators remain at large.Police said the thieves had used the \"quiet Christmas days\" to rob the building on Nienhofstrasse in the Buer district.Initial investigations suggest they gained access to the bank, and escaped, via an adjacent parking garage.Witnesses have reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday. Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage, on De-La-Chevallerie-Strasse, early on Monday morning.The hole into the underground vault room was discovered when a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, and police and the fire brigade searched the building.Affected bank customers have been asked to contact Sparkasse bank, which has set up a hotline. Police secured the entrance of the branch on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information.\"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information,\" one man told the Welt broadcaster, according to Reuters, as he waited outside the branch, adding that it contained his savings for old age.A message on the bank's website said the branch would remain closed on Tuesday following the break-in.Sparkasse said 95% of customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, so the likelihood they were affected is \"very high\". It added that the contents of each compartment are insured up to €10,300 and told customers to check if they had additional coverage through their home insurance.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTabby WilsonWatch: Injured passengers helped from train after collision near Machu PicchuA train driver has died and at least 40 people have been injured in a head-on rail collision near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu.Two trains collided on the single track leading to the ancient Inca town on Tuesday, according to a statement from the local government. It said that 20 ambulances had attended the scene and that injured people had been transferred to medical facilities in the nearby city of Cusco.The US embassy in Peru said that US citizens were injured in the crash, but police have yet to confirm the identities of anyone involved in the incident.Getty ImagesOne of the two trains affected in the collisionLocal media outlet Peru21 reports that \"hundreds\" of tourists remain at the scene awaiting evacuation, which has been \"hampered\" by difficult terrain around the crash site.At least 20 of the injured are in a serious condition, a health official told the Reuters news agency. The collision occurred on the track linking Ollantaytambo Station and Aguas Calientes, the closest town to Machu Picchu. The journey between the two stations usually takes around 90 minutes. The two trains involved in the accident were operated by PeruRail and Inca Rail respectively.\"We deeply regret what has happened,\" PeruRail said in a statement, adding that its staff had \"immediately\" provided first aid to the train driver, the train conductor and the passengers involved in the incident. The cause of the accident has not yet been made clear. The crash comes amid an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to the Unesco world heritage site, with local communities unhappy with what they say is an insufficiently open bidding process. The trains and buses that take tourists to the ancient town have steep ticket prices and can be highly lucrative due to its limited accessibility. Built in the Peruvian Andes in the 15th Century, the Incan city of Machu Picchu is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. Visitors can take a series of trains and buses to reach the site, or hike along the the Inca trail with a registered tour operator. In 2011, officials implemented a daily cap on visitors to protect and preserve the site, but concerns remain about overtourism.",

    "body": "Pensioner 'carried on roof of car' and killed in crash11 hours agoJacob Panons,South EastandZac Sherratt,South EastGetty ImagesA third person has been arrested in connection with the death on a man in his 80sThree men have been arrested after a pedestrian in his 80s died after being hit by a car and carried on top of it for as much as a mile.Kent Police said the man was struck by a grey Mercedes estate on the A289 Gads Hill, in Gillingham, on Monday and carried for an unspecified distance.A postman is said to have found the man's body in Grange Road before the vehicle was later discovered in Eastcourt Lane.A man, 29, from Chatham, and another man, 28, of no fixed address, were arrested the same day. On Tuesday, a third man, 28, from Edgware in north-west London, was also arrested in connection with the incident.Police said the two occupants of the Mercedes had fled on foot.Ralph Belmonte, a resident of Grange Road for 47 years, said a postman discovered the body on the road after having mistaken it for a dummy strapped to the roof of a driving car.\"It was only on his return to drop the rest of the mail off that he saw [the body] on the road and approached it thinking that it might have been a dummy and it could create a problem, an accident,\" Mr Belmonte said.\"And as he went to turn it over, he realised it was actually a body.\"He added: \"It's as safe as anybody's area really, until something like this happens, you know – everything's safe until becomes unsafe.\"It's not an area known for high crime rate, but it can happen anywhere.\"Witness appealDetectives investigating the crash released CCTV images which showed two hooded men dressed in dark clothing on a pavement on foot, with one appearing to be running while carrying a number plate.South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedics treated the pedestrian at the scene but he later died, a spokesperson said. Det Insp Zoe Wilczek, of Kent Police's serious collision investigation unit, said the force was continuing to appeal for witnesses.\"We would like to thank all those who have assisted our investigation so far,\" she said.\"We are urging anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw the vehicle or pedestrian prior to the collision, to contact us.\"We're also asking anyone who may have caught any part of the incident on their dashcams and CCTV, and has not yet got in touch with us, to do so.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her uncle Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Before her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

    "body": "Gold and silver have seen a rollercoaster end to a year in which their prices are on track to record their biggest annual gains since 1979.The price of gold soared by more than 60% this year to hit a record high of more than $4,549 (£3,378) an ounce before slipping after Christmas to stand at about $4,350 on New Year's Eve.At the same time, silver was trading at about $74 an ounce after hitting an all-time high of of $83.62 on Monday.This year's gains were fuelled by a number of reasons including expectations of more interest rate cuts, gold purchases by central banks and as investors buy so-called \"safe haven\" assets due to concerns about global tensions and economic uncertainty.\"Gold and silver prices are experiencing a notable rise due to the interplay of several economic, investment, and geopolitical factors,\" said Rania Gule from trading platform XS.com.The main driver of the price rises of precious metals, she added, are expectations that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again in 2026.Also this year, central banks around the world added hundreds of tons of gold to their reserves, according to the World Gold Council trade association.Daniel Takieddine, co-founder of investment firm Sky Links Capital Group, points to \"supply tightness and industrial demand\" for helping to push up the price of silver.China, which is the world's second biggest producer of silver, has said it would restrict the export of the precious metal.In October, China's Ministry of Commerce announced new restrictions on exports of silver as well as the metals tungsten and antimony to \"to step up the protection of resources and the environment\".Responding to a post on social media about Chinese government restrictions on silver exports, Tesla boss Elon Musk said: \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes.\"Mr Takieddine also highlighted the large amounts of money that have flowed into the precious metals market through investments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs).ETFs are baskets of investments that trade on a stock exchange like a single stock. They can be seen as a convenient way to trade precious metals as investors do not have to take possession of physical bullion.Ms Gule said she expects gold to continue to rise in 2026 but \"at a more stable pace compared to the record highs observed in 2025\".Silver also has the potential to rise again in the coming year, said Mr Takieddine. But he warns \"rallies may be followed by sharper corrections.\"",

Start-up brings factory in orbit one step closer to reality4 hours agoRebecca Morelle,Science EditorandAlison Francis,Senior Science JournalistTony Jolliffe/BBC NewsThe mini factory will make semiconductors in spaceIt sounds like science fiction - a factory, located hundreds of kilometres above the Earth, churning out high-quality materials.But a Cardiff-based company is a step closer to making this a reality.Space Forge have sent a microwave-sized factory into orbit, and have demonstrated that its furnace can be switched on and reach temperatures of around 1,000C.They plan to manufacture material for semiconductors, which can be used back on Earth in electronics in communications infrastructure, computing and transport.Tony Jolliffe/ BBC NewsSemiconductors made in space will be up to 4,000 times purer Conditions in space are ideal for making semiconductors, which have the atoms they're made of arranged in a highly ordered 3D structure.When they are being manufactured in a weightless environment, those atoms line up absolutely perfectly. The vacuum of space also means that contaminants can't sneak in.The purer and more ordered a semiconductor is, the better it works.\"The work that we're doing now is allowing us to create semiconductors up to 4,000 times purer in space than we can currently make here today,\" says Josh Western, CEO of Space Forge.\"This sort of semiconductor would go on to be in the 5G tower in which you get your mobile phone signal, it's going to be in the car charger you plug an EV into, it's going to be in the latest planes.\"Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsVeronica Viera said seeing the images of glowing plasma from space was amazing  The company's mini-factory launched on a SpaceX rocket in the summer. Since then the team has been testing its systems from their mission control in Cardiff.Veronica Viera, the company's payload operations lead, shows us an image that the satellite beamed back from space.It's taken from the inside of the furnace, and shows plasma -  gas heated to about 1,000C - glowing brightly.She told us seeing the image was \"one of the most exciting moments of my life\".\"This is so important because it's one of the core ingredients that we need for our in-space manufacturing process,\" she explains.  \"So being able to demonstrate this is amazing.\"Space ForgeThe heat shield will need to be tested to see if it can safely return the materials The team is now planning to build a bigger space factory - one that could make semiconductor material for 10,000 chips.They also need to test the technology to bring the material back to Earth.On a future mission, a heat shield named Pridwen after the legendary shield of King Arthur will be deployed to protect the spacecraft from the intense temperatures it will experience as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere.Other companies are also looking skywards -  to make everything from pharmaceuticals to artificial tissues.\"In-space manufacturing is something that is happening now,\" says Libby Jackson, head of space at the Science Museum.\"It's the early days and they're still showing this in small numbers at the moment.\"But by proving the technology it really opens the door for an economically viable product,  where things can be made in space and return to Earth and have use and benefit to everybody on Earth. And that's really exciting.\"",

    "body": "US actor George Clooney, his wife, human rights lawyer Amal and their two children have been awarded French citizenship, the government said. The family's new citizenship was made public in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.Their farm in Brignoles, in the south of France, serves as the family's primary residence. The couple purchased the home in 2021.Didier Brémond, the city's mayor, told local media that their decision to become French citizens was a testament to \"his love for our country\".  He told broadcaster BFMTV that the Clooneys are \"a very simple and very accessible family\". \"Here, he wants to live normally, and that's what he is trying to do,\" he said.In an Esquire magazine interview earlier this year, George Clooney said his family decided to move to France because he was \"worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood\".\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he added.\"We live on a farm in France,\" Clooney told Esquire. \"A good portion of my life growing up was on a farm, and as a kid, I hated the whole idea of it.\"But now, for them, it's like – they're not on their iPads, you know? They have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"In addition to their home in France, George Clooney also owns a home in the UK and in Kentucky, where he was born, according to the New York Times.The Clooneys' twins, Ella and Alexander, were born in London in 2017. Their mother was born in Lebanon and raised in the UK. The Journal Officiel shows Amal Clooney was naturalised under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The adjustment to French life appears to be easier for Amal Clooney and her children than for her husband. George Clooney described his wife and children's French as perfect in a recent interview promoting his new movie Jay Kelly. The actor, however, described his French as \"horrible,\" despite trying to teach himself the language using an app. \"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face, and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French broadcaster Canal+.",

    "body": "Israel is to revoke the licenses of 37 aid groups working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they failed to meet requirements under new registration rules.Well-known international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) such as ActionAid, the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council are among those that will have their licenses suspended on 1 January, with their operations to end within 60 days. Israel said the groups, among other things, had failed to hand over \"complete\" personal details of their staff. The move was heavily criticised by foreign ministers from 10 countries including the UK, who said the new rules were \"restrictive\" and \"unacceptable\".In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the UK, France, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said the forced closure of INGO operations would \"have a severe impact on access to essential services including healthcare\".They added that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remained \"catastrophic\" and  called on Israel's government to ensure INGOs were able to operate \"in a sustained and predictable way\". Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which is in charge of registration applications, said the new measures would not impact the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.It added that aid continued to be delivered through \"approved and vetted channels\", including UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian organisations. It said the primary reason aid groups were having their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\". Earlier this month, UN-backed experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas in October, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" the following month. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said the organisations that will be suspended \"did not bring aid into Gaza throughout the current ceasefire\". It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\". The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said that fewer than 15% of organisations providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework. That framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic stateDenying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisationPromoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against IsraelCalling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in oneSupporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courtsThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international organisations - previously warned that the new registration system \"fundamentally jeopardises\" the operations of INGOs in Gaza and the West Bank. \"The system relies on vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles,\" it said.It added: \"While some INGOs have been registered under the new system, these INGOs represent only a fraction of the response in Gaza and are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs.\"According to the Humanitarian Country Team, INGOs currently run or support most of Gaza's field hospitals and primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"Other organisations to be suspended include CARE, Medico International and Medical Aid for Palestinians.

The instruction comes after \"chaos\" saw all Eurostar trains from London to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels suspended following a power outage in the Channel Tunnel. Services have resumed but people looking to get away for New Year's Eve could \"suffer 10-hour delays\", the i Paper adds.The Sun leads on Anthony Joshua, after he was injured in a car crash on Tuesday which killed two members of his team. The paper says the British boxer has said \"I feel pain all over my body\", with sources close to Joshua saying he will remain in hospital for the new year.Family and friends rallying around Anthony Joshua is the focus of the Daily Mirror's front page. It reports that the boxer's mother is \"by his side in hospital\" as the 36-year-old recovers from the devastating crash.The front page of the Daily Star asks readers to \"give a littler respect\" to English darts player Luke Littler as his mum, Lisa, \"slams\" his critics. Littler was booed by crowds during and after his win over Rob Cross at the PDC World Championship.The top of the Financial Times' front page has been taken over by cardboard boxes today with a picture and headline reading \"Where do all the boxes go?\" The paper's lead story, however, is concerned with private equity firms that are selling companies to themselves at a \"record rate amid low exit values\". The Daily Telegraph leads with a warning from former SAS commanders that \"Labour will wreck special forces\" if they go ahead with plans to scrap the controversial Troubles legacy act, which gave legal immunity to troops who had served in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the main picture on the front page is of the King, Prince of Wales and Princess Anne dressed up for the Trooping of the Colour earlier this year - one of the pictures chosen by William and Catherine as their favourite moments of 2025.Some police forces are facing ruin, according to the Daily Mail, which has spoken to the head of the National Police Chiefs Council who has predicted crime will surge by up to 6% in just one year. Police chiefs say it is due to Labour's planned justice reforms, including the plan to \"jail fewer offenders by ditching shorter prison sentences and releasing inmates earlier\".Britain has seen the worst investment levels across the G7, the Times says, which has led Labour MPs to accuse Rachel Reeves of \"broken commitments\" and impacting business confidence. Meanwhile, the Times' main picture captures Mona Seif, the sister of Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, campaigning for his release with David Lammy, who is currently deputy PM, in 2022. Millions of people visiting A&E for coughs or hiccups that health leaders blame on a \"primary care crisis\", wins the top slot for the Guardian's front page today. The paper reports that Health Secretary Wes Streeting \"faces pressure to show he is making progress on the NHS\", which it says is \"failing to give patients prompt access to primary care\". In an exclusive, the Daily Express reports on \"meddling Euro judges\" working on Shamima Begum's case. The European Court of Human Rights has reportedly formally challenged Britain's decision to strip her of her citizenship in 2019, which Ms Begum's lawyers have welcomed, the Daily Express says.Related Internet Links",

We were on the Smash Hits Roadshows. We'd all be touring together and coming back to our flat. It was very cute.\"So who took longer in the bathroom, him or Louise? \"Shano,\" he answers without missing a beat. \"Plucking his eyebrow!\"BBC/Jack Barnes/Kieron McCarronShona McGarty was in EastEnders for 16 years playing Whitney Dean. Tonight she is more Whitney HoustonAnother special guest is the former EastEnders star and finalist in this year's I'm A Celebrity, Shona McGarty. \"What a voice,\" enthuses Keating. \"She was singing every night on the show and I just thought, man, we've got to get her on New Year's Eve. That was her audition.\"Tonight, there  will be no rendition of her campsite creation Feeling Good in the Jungle. Instead she will be duetting on the Tracy Chapman song that Boyzone took to number two in the charts, Baby Can I Hold You. Calum Scott, whose album Bridges is a favourite in the Keating household (\"I love his voice. I love his songwriting\") will sing the late Stephen Gately's part on No Matter What.Getty ImagesBoyzone in 1996, L-R: Keith Duffy, Ronan Keating, Shane Lynch, Mikey Graham, and Stephen GatelyExactly 30 years ago this week, Boyzone's version of Father and Son was prevented from reaching number one by Michael Jackson's Earth Song.Two members of the group, Keith Duffy and Shane Lynch, will be seen tonight, giving a taste of what can be expected when Boyzone reunite in 2026, for two huge shows in June at London's Emirates stadium. \"It's unbelievable,\" beams Keating.\"Boyzone never headlined a stadium before.\"The guest list is ridiculous. The phone hasn't stopped ringing. And yes, I have received more Christmas cards this year than I normally do,\" he chortles.Resolutions? He's saying nothing at allOne thing Keating will not be doing is making any New Year's resolutions. \"If I've got to make changes, I make them now. I won't wait till a certain date, because I'll only fail.\" He pauses, suddenly looking more wistful. \"Really for me it's about spending more time with loved ones; family and friends. It's been a tough couple of years. We lost my brother,\" he explains.In July 2023, his elder brother Ciaran was killed in a car crash at the age of 57, while travelling to watch his son Ruairí play for Cork City Football Club.\"Now, keeping the family together is more important than ever for me,\" he emphasises.It suddenly becomes clear that Keating was also talking about himself when explaining how difficult people can find new year. Tonight he too will use music as part of his own healing process, by singing the soundtrack to his more than 30-year career, a period over which he has made the journey from Boyzone to family man.Ronan and Friends: A New Year's Eve Party is on BBC One and iPlayer from 23:30 except in Scotland where the Hogmanay show will feature music from sea shanty singer Nathan Evans, Michelle McManus and the award-winning folk supergroup Mànran.

    "body": "Protests and strikes in Iran over inflation and currency devaluation have spread from the capital, Tehran, to several other cities on a third day of unrest.The protests began on Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar staged a strike when the Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar on the open market.Since then, videos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd. Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets... But people were absolutely not influenced by what the enemy wanted,\" Khamenei said in September.",

    "body": "The rapper Ghetts is facing further charges of dangerous driving on the day he allegedly killed a young man in a hit-and-run collision.The award-winning musician, whose real name is Justin Clarke-Samuel, allegedly failed to stop after his BMW hit 20-year-old Yubin Tamang on Redbridge Lane, Ilford on 18 October.Mr Clarke-Samuel, from Woodford, east London, was initially charged with a single count of causing Mr Tamang's death by dangerous driving. He now faces two further charges of dangerous driving before and after the crash on 18 October.It is alleged Mr Clarke-Samuel was driving dangerously in Tavistock Place and other roads in Camden, north London.Following the collision with Mr Tamang in Ilford at about 23:30 GMT, it is alleged Mr Clarke-Samuel continued to drive dangerously in Worcester Crescent, Redbridge, on the journey back to his home in Woodford.Police attended the defendant's address in Woodford early the next day.The black BMW, allegedly registered and insured in the defendant's name, was said to have been significantly damaged.On Monday, Mr Clarke-Samuel appeared at the Old Bailey by videolink from Pentonville prison wearing a plain, grey short-sleeved T-shirt.He spoke to confirm his name as members of Mr Tamang's family watched in the court, having travelled from Nepal.Judge Nigel Lickley KC remanded him in custody and set a plea hearing for 8 December.Ghetts is a Mercury Prize-nominated grime MC, rapper and songwriter who has had high profile musical collaborations with major acts including Stormzy, Ed Sheeran and Skepta.He won the Best Male Act at the Mobo Awards in 2021 and received the Mobo Pioneer award in 2024 for his \"significant contribution to British black culture\".",

    "body": "An Australian senator has provoked anger for wearing a burka in parliament, after pushing for a ban on the Muslim garment.Pauline Hanson was condemned by fellow senators, with one accusing her of \"blatant racism\". Proceedings in the senate were halted as she refused to remove the item. The Queensland senator, of the anti-immigration One Nation party, was seeking to introduce a bill that would ban full face coverings in public – a policy she has long campaigned for.It is the second time she has worn the garment – which covers the face and body – in parliament, and said her actions were in protest at the senate rejecting her bill.Shortly after other lawmakers blocked her from introducing the bill on Monday, she returned wearing a black burka.\"This is a racist senator, displaying blatant racism,\" said Mehreen Faruqi, a Muslim  Greens senator from New South Wales.Fatima Payman, an independent senator from the state of Western Australia, called the stunt \"disgraceful\".Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who serves as leader of the government in the senate, condemned it as \"disrespectful\". \"We represent in our states, people of every faith, of every faith of all backgrounds. And we should do so decently,\" she said.She added Hanson was \"not worthy of a member of the Australian Senate\" and moved a motion to suspend Hanson for failing to remove the garment. In a post on Facebook, Hanson wrote \"If they don't want me wearing it - ban the burka.\"She previously wore a burka to parliament in 2017, also calling for a national ban at the time.In 2016, Hanson was criticised for her maiden speech to the Australian senate, in which she said the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Muslims\".It echoed her controversial 1996 speech in which she warned that the country was in danger of being \"swamped by Asians\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesJimmy Cliff's hits included Many Rivers To Cross, Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really WantJimmy Cliff, one of the most prominent and beloved proponents of reggae music, has died at the age of 81.A star since the 1960s, he helped to bring the sound of Jamaica to a global audience through hits such as Wonderful World, Beautiful People and You Can Get It If You Really Want.His lead role as a gun-toting rebel in the 1972 crime drama The Harder They Come is a cornerstone of Jamaican cinema, and was attributed as the movie that brought reggae to America.Cliff's wife, Latifa Chambers, announced his death via a statement on Instagram.\"It's with profound sadness that I share that my husband, Jimmy Cliff, has crossed over due to a seizure followed by pneumonia,\" she wrote.\"I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. \"To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career.\"Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace. I will follow your wishes.\" Her message was also signed by their children, Lilty and Aken.Getty ImagesBorn James Chambers in 1944, Cliff grew up as the eighth of nine children in abject poverty in the parish of St. James, Jamaica.Blessed with a sweet, mellifluous voice, he began singing at his local church at the age of six.He was inspired to write his own material when he heard ska pioneer Derrick Morgan on the radio - and asked his woodwork teacher how one might go about composing their own song. “He told me, ‘You just write it!’“ he told Mojo magazine. ”So I went ahead and… wrote a song called I Need A Fiancée, another called Sob Sob and I made a guitar out of bamboo to accompany myself.”By the time he was 14, he'd moved to Kingston and adopted the surname Cliff to express the heights he intended on reaching.He recorded a handful of singles before topping the Jamaican charts with his own composition, Hurricane Hattie. In 1965, he relocated to London to work with Island Records - later the home of Bob Marley - but the label's attempts to make his sound palatable to rock audiences were initially unsuccessful.He eventually struck gold with the 1969 single Wonderful World, Beautiful People - an upbeat, feelgood anthem; and the more politically-charged Vietnam, which Bob Dylan called \"the best protest song ever written\".Its lyric tells the story of a young soldier who writes from the war, promising his mother he'll be home soon; only for her to receive a telegram the next day, informing her of his death.Cliff reflected on the song in 1986, telling reggae archivist Roger Steffens: \"The essence of my music is struggle. What gives it the icing is the hope of love.\"Getty ImagesThe Harder They Come had to be subtitled in the US because of the character's thick Jamaican patoisThe musician became an international star with The Harder They Come, expressly written for the movie of the same name, in which he played Ivan Martin, a young man trying to break into Jamaica's corrupt music industry.\"The film opened the door for Jamaica,\" Cliff recalled. \"It said, 'This is where this music comes from.'\"BBC Sounds: Witness - Jimmy Cliff on The Harder They ComeBBC 6 Music: The First Time with Jimmy CliffCliff contributed four songs to the soundtrack, including the gospel hymn Many Rivers To Cross, which reflected his early days as a struggling artist in the UK.\"I was still in my teens,\" he later recalled. \"I came full of vigour: I'm going to make it, I'm going to be up there with the Beatles and the Stones.\"\"And it wasn't really going like that, I was touring clubs, not breaking through. I was struggling, with work, life, my identity. I couldn't find my place. Frustration fuelled the song.\"Instead, the film and its soundtrack won him international acclaim. Rolling Stone magazine even named it one of their top 500 albums of all time.During the 1980s, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on their Dirty Work album, and he returned to the US charts in 1993 with his cover of I Can See Clearly Now, from the soundtrack for Cool Runnings, which followed the escapades of Jamaica's bobsled team.His other recordings included the Grammy Award-winning albums Cliff Hanger (1985) and Rebirth (2012), a nostalgic return to form.Cliff entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010, calling it \"a great thrill and an honour\".Inducting him, Fugees star Wyclef Jean said he'd been inspired by Cliff's success as a young boy growing up in Haiti.\"When we saw Jimmy Cliff, we saw ourselves,\" he said.Cliff continued to tour late into his life, playing Glastonbury's legends slot in 2003; and winning over a new generation of fans at the 2010 Coachella Festival.His contributions to Jamaican music and culture were recognised in October 2003 when he was awarded the country's prestigious Order of Merit.But the singer said his connection to fans was more important than any of the other honours bestowed upon him.Speaking to US radio station NPR in 2012, he reflected: \"When someone comes up to me and says, 'I was a dropout in school and I heard your song You Can Get It If You Really Want, and that song made me go back to school, and now I am a teacher and I use your song with my students' - that, for me, is a big success.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterTwo peers are set to be suspended from the House of Lords for breaching rules, including providing parliamentary services in return for \"payment or reward\".Former Army chief Lord Richard Dannatt and businessman Lord David Evans of Watford face suspensions of four and five months respectively.The House of Lords' standards watchdog launched separate investigations into the two men following an undercover operation by the Guardian newspaper. Neither peer appealed the standard commissioner's findings or the sanctions, which will come into force once approved by the House of Lords.In the course of his investigation, the standards commissioner found that crossbench peer Lord Dannatt had breached the code of conduct by corresponding with ministers and government officials about three companies - UK Nitrogen, Teledyne UK and Blue International Holdings - in which he had a financial interest.The commissioner also identified four ways in which Labour peer Lord Evans had broken the rules, including by sponsoring events in Parliament for a company that was owned by his son, and in which he held one-third of the shares. Both men referred themselves to the commissioner after the Guardian reported comments they had made to the newspaper's undercover reporters.Lord Dannatt was filmed telling the journalists, posing as potential commercial clients, he could make introductions to people in government and could \"make a point of getting to know\" the best-placed ministers.The commissioner concluded that no lobbying had taken place and no payment had been received.However, he said Lord Dannatt had demonstrated \"a clear willingness to undertake activity that would have amounted to paid parliamentary services\" and had \"demonstrated insufficient regard for the need to act solely in the public interest in the course of his parliamentary activities\".For that reason, he said the peer had breached the section of the code of conduct which requires members to \"always act on their personal honour\".During the course of the investigation, the commissioner identified three further breaches, relating to Lord Dannatt contacting people in government about companies in which he had a financial interest.In these instances, the commissioner said the peer had breached the section of the code which states that peers \"must not seek to profit from membership of the House by accepting or agreeing to accept payment or other incentive or reward in return for providing parliamentary advice or services\". He said Lord Dannatt's \"lack of understanding\" about the code and his belief that he was \"acting in the national interest\" were not mitigating factors, but acknowledged the peer's \"proactive expressions of remorse\" and \"willingness to learn\".In a statement, Lord Dannatt accepted three breaches of the code of conduct had been found by the commissioner but added \"for the record\" that the Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists had investigated the two UK-based matters and \"concluded that I had not conducted consultant lobbying\".He said he \"deeply\" regretted the findings and said that the \"honourable course of action was not to waste the Conduct Committee's time by appealing against the findings but to accept the appropriate sanction\".Lord Dannatt said he had declared all relevant interests, as well as registering them with the Registrar of Lords' Interests, but he accepted his actions had been \"insufficient\" and that \"ignorance\" was no defence for any breach of the code of conduct. He added: \"I also understand that acting in the national interest in good faith, which was my motivation in the three matters, is not an excuse or justification for breaching the Code of Conduct.\"At nearly 75 no-one is too old to learn lessons and I hope that these activities will be placed in the context of my 56-years public service.\"Lord Evans was found to have failed to \"act on his personal honour\" by telling the Guardian journalists he could introduce them to MPs.He also sponsored events in Parliament for the company, Affinity, and asked members of the House of Lords if they would speak at the events. Tickets to the events were advertised for sale at a price greater than the actual cost per head, contravening House of Lords rules on holding events, the commissioner's report said. He noted that Lord Evans had believed his shares in Affinity had been transferred to his son in 2013 and therefore \"did not think he would benefit from sponsoring events for Affinity as a shareholder\". However, the commissioner concluded that, taking into the account the \"number and seriousness of the breaches\", a lengthy suspension from the Lords would be appropriate. Speaking to the commissioner for the inquiry, Lord Evans said of the meeting with the undercover journalists: \"I was suspicious of the whole approach... in hindsight, I should not have agreed to attend the online meeting.\"Asked if he thought it was appropriate to invite peers to the events he hosted on behalf of Affinity, Lord Evans said: \"Given the circumstances at the time, when I didn't even know I was a shareholder - I had resigned from the company - I thought it was appropriate and I wasn't breaking any rules.\"\"I'm horrified by the whole thing. I've had a clean reputation all my life. I've never done anything wrong,\" he added. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorDrug maker Novo Nordisk says semaglutide, the active ingredient for the weight loss jab Wegovy, does not slow Alzheimer's - despite initial hopes that it might help against dementia.Researchers began two large trials involving more than 3,800 people after reports the medicine was having an impact in the real world.But the studies showed the GLP-1 drug, which is already used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity, made no difference compared to a dummy drug. The disappointing results are due to be presented at an Alzheimer's disease conference next month and are yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Dr Susan Kohlhaas from Alzheimer's Research UK said the results would come as a blow for people affected by Alzheimer's.Martin Holst Lange, chief scientific officer and executive vice president of research and development at Novo Nordisk, said: \"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success.\"While semaglutide did not demonstrate efficacy in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the extensive body of evidence supporting semaglutide continues to provide benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and related comorbidities,\" he said. The patients who took part in the Evoke trials were aged between 55 and 85 and had mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.Dementia progression was monitored and measured through tests and interviews. Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers, but this did not translate into delaying progression of the disease.Dr Kohlhaas said: \"These trial results are another reminder that Alzheimer's is driven by several different biological processes. No single approach is likely to be enough. \"The field now needs to focus on understanding those processes in much greater detail and developing treatments that can be used together to tackle the disease from multiple angles.\"She added that the growing use of GLP-1 medicines through private prescriptions, largely for weight loss, offers an opportunity to gather better real-world data on their longer-term effects.Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at Alzheimer's Society, said while it was \"very disappointing\" that these eagerly awaited results were not what everyone had hoped for, \"no trial is wasted\".\"Every investigation helps us develop better drugs and design better trials in the future.\"She said there were currently more than 130 Alzheimer's drugs in clinical trials of which around 30 are in late-stage trials - the final step before they are considered by regulators.",

    "body": "Strictly's Shirley reveals 'terrifying' choking drama7 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterPAShirley Ballas said she \"almost didn't make it to the [Strictly judges'] desk\" on SaturdayStrictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has said she \"couldn't breathe\" for 20 minutes after choking on a fish bone before Saturday's live show in Blackpool.Posting about the \"terrifying\" ordeal on Instagram, the show's head judge said: \"I really thought that was it.\"She praised her hair and make-up artist Jane Green for being ready, willing and able to dislodge the blockage by performing the Heimlich manoeuvre.\"I choked earlier on a fishbone,\" Ballas explained. \"It got lodged in my throat, and my wonderful Jane, who has been with me for nine years, did the Heimlich manoeuvre, and we got the bone out. But for 20 minutes there, it was lodged and I couldn't breathe, so it was terrifying.\"She joked that Strictly would \"have been a judge down tonight if it wasn't for her\".Ballas contined: \"Gratitude to Jane because I panicked. I really thought that was it, the end, amen.\"In a separate post, the Liverpudlian dancer and TV personality, 65, wrote: \"Almost didn't make it to the desk last night, I had a fishbone stuck.\"She updated her followers in a later post by saying she was \"a bit hoarse, but all is good\".She also vowed to learn how to peform the Heimlich manoeuvre - which involves abdominal thrusts from behind - \"in case I ever come across anybody who needs my help\".Only four in ten people know the first aid skills needed for choking, according to research from England's first aid charity St John Ambulance in August 2024.Ballas took over as head judge on the celebrity dance contest from Len Goodman in 2017.How to help someone who's chokingThe NHS advises that for severe choking - when the person is unable to breathe, speak and/or cough to clear the blockage themself - a helper should administer five sharp back blows between the shoulders from behind (for anyone over the age of one year old).If the blockage has not cleared, the NHS says the helper should try abdominal thrusts. It suggests:Stand behind the person who is chokingPlace your arms around their waist and bend them well forwardClench one fist and place it just above the person's belly buttonPlace your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwardsRepeat this up to five timesBBC News health reporter Michelle Roberts said people who find themselves choking, in a similar manner to Ballas, should seek urgent medical help. \"A fish bone in the airways causing breathing problems is an emergency,\" she said.\"Sometimes a bone may get stuck in the throat or gullet instead. A doctor will be able to assess whether the bone is likely to pass through on its own or if treatment is needed to remove it.\"They may do a scan and recommend removal under anaesthetic.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed \"important steps\" made during peace talks with the US in Geneva - but warned the \"main problem\" remained Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine.After US and Ukrainian officials convened in Switzerland on Sunday to discuss ending the war with Russia, officials from both sides reported \"progress\" and an intention to continue working. However, no details have emerged on how to bridge the considerable divide between Moscow and Kyiv over territorial issues and security guarantees for Ukraine.It is now thought that Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet to discuss the more contentious points, although no timeline has been given.The question of territorial integrity in particular is a key point of divergence between Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky has repeatedly said Moscow should not be rewarded for its aggression with land it seized by force, and that doing so would create a dangerous precedent.Following the end of the talks in Geneva Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\", but with the caveat: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland and the Kremlin said it hadn't received any information on the outcome of the discussions. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Moscow was aware that \"adjustments\" were made to the plan that had initially been welcomed by Putin.That 28-point peace proposal was drafted by US and Russian officials in October and presented to Ukraine last week. Several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands, sparking consternation in Kyiv and its European allies. Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until Thursday to accept the deal or face serious cuts in US support contributed to creating a sense of urgency across Europe and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.By Sunday evening US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a \"tremendous\" amount of progress had been made at the talks. \"I honestly believe we'll get there,\" he said. But some European leaders have been more cautious. \"I am not sure if we are closer to peace,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said discussions would be a \"lengthy, long-lasting process\" and that he did not expect any breakthroughs this week.Europeans were left scrambling for a seat at the table last week, after they were seemingly caught unawares when the US draft peace plan was presented. A counter-proposal - reportedly drafted by Britain, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's allowed army size and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. Rubio said he was not aware of the plan and on Monday Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov rubbished it as \"completely unconstructive\".Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. The 28-point plan presented last week would have Ukrainian forces withdraw from the part of Donetsk they currently control. That area would become a neutral demilitarised buffer zone \"internationally recognised as territory belonging to the Russian Federation\".This arrangement too would be difficult to accept for Ukraine. Kyiv and its European partners are wary of any settlement which jeopardises the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty - and Zelensky has repeatedly warned that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future. Another key Russian demand is for Ukraine to never become part of Nato. But Kyiv sees membership of the alliance as the only way to protect itself from future attacks - and joining Nato is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Despite last week's frenzied diplomacy the next steps in the process are unclear. The expectation is that Zelensky will soon personally speak to Trump, after which a new draft peace plan will be eventually presented to Moscow. There were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and US negotiators, the Kremlin said.British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine. A virtual \"coalition of the willing\" meeting will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, he added.",

My daddy says if we don't give up we can do anything so I won't give up.\"Please help me raise pennies for the boys and girls who need help.\"Craig and Faye began the climb in darkness at 07:00 and carried all their overnight gear.They set up camp half way up before pushing on through deep snow and fierce winds.Battling over the icy slopes in crampons, they reached the summit in \"very tough conditions\" during a blizzard. They then began the long descent back to their tent - much of it in heavy rain and using headtorches to navigate their way through the dark.The father and daughter took up the 10-hour challenge to raise money for GCHC which supports more than 500 babies, children and young people every day.Craig said: \"The hospital does incredible work for children and families all across Scotland.\"The charity helped Faye's cousin and friend Lucy, who had surgery after being born with half a heart and is now thriving.\"My cousin Owen and friend Lucy are both alive because of the hospital and charity,\" Faye said. \"I want to raise pennies to help buy things to help children who aren't well.\" ",

    "body": "52 minutes agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent , Geneva Donald Trump wants a peace deal in Ukraine very badly.Kyiv wants peace even more, just not at any cost.That's why when the US began pushing it to agree to a deal by Thanksgiving on what looked close to surrender terms, Ukraine pushed back.It scrambled senior officials to talks in Geneva and all of Sunday we saw delegates from the US and Ukraine shuttling back and forth between the two main venues in black limousines with darkened windows.They were joined by national security advisers from Germany, France and the UK.The only time I glimpsed Andriy Yermak, heading the negotiating team from Kyiv, he looked stony-faced.No wonder: the starting proposal on the table was so skewed towards Russia's demands, the talks began with the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny it had been written by the Kremlin.But Donald Trump had been clear that Ukraine needed to sign up fast or face unspecified consequences. So Kyiv had to engage.On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though - Ukraine's deputy foreign minister Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.Several officials, including the British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.Or perhaps the days of frantic diplomacy have only left everything back where it started.\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoJonathan Beale, Anastasiia Levchenko and Volodymyr Lozhko in KyivReutersSome troops are resigned to the proposals but many remain defiant, and angryUkraine's frontline soldiers have reacted to draft US peace proposals with a mixture of defiance, anger and resignation.The BBC spoke to half a dozen who sent us their views via social media and email in response to the original US plan – details of which were leaked last week.Since then, American and Ukrainian negotiators have been working on changes to the proposals – and are set to continue talks about the \"peace framework\". Of the original US plan, Yaroslav, in eastern Ukraine, says it \"sucks… no one will support it\" while an army medic with the call sign Shtutser dismissed it as an \"absolutely disgraceful draft of a peace plan, unworthy of our attention\".But one soldier with the call sign Snake told us \"it's time to agree at least on something\".This is what the soldiers who spoke to the BBC had to say about some of the key points in the original US draft peace plan.Giving up territoryThe US put forward a draft peace proposal at a time when Russia is making significant advances on the battlefield. Over the past month alone Ukraine has lost a further 450 sq km to Russia. Kyiv still controls around 15% of the Donbas region, the eastern part of Ukraine encompassing the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts which is a key war goal for Russia. But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it. Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\". \"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.Cutting the size of Ukraine's armed forcesThe US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.Getty ImagesIt is thought more than 800,000 Ukrainians are currently in uniformArmy medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".Security guaranteesUkraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union. There is a promise of US security guarantees if Russia were to attack again, though no further detail on the measure of that support. The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee. The UK and France have been leading efforts to provide a \"reassurance force\" in the event of a ceasefire, through a \"Coalition of the Willing\". \"I like the UK's plan to put troops into Ukraine [through this coalition],\" he says. \"This is the only plan that will help us win, to introduce allied troops.\"Getty ImagesThe UK is one of the countries which is planning to send forces to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefireBut staff officer Andrii does not believe Europe can provide much in the way of security guarantees. \"Europe has turned out to be completely spineless and divided,\" he says. \"It seems all hope rests only on the United States.\"However, other soldiers suggest there is no great faith in the US either. \"US security guarantees under its current government are not guarantees at all,\" says Schtutser.Fresh electionsThe US draft plan sets out a proposal for Ukraine to hold fresh elections within 100 days of the end of the war. Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoGeeta PandeyDelhiDinodiaDharmendra often said he was 'embarrassed' by talk about his looksBollywood star Dharmendra has died in the Indian city of Mumbai at the age of 89.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to the actor, saying his passing \"marks the end of an era in Indian cinema\".Dharmendra, who often described himself as \"a simple man\", commanded extraordinary affection and loyalty from his tens of millions of fans.Best known as Veeru, the lovable petty criminal in the 1975 blockbuster Sholay, he appeared in over 300 films, many hits, captivating audiences for decades.Songs featuring him topped the charts, and his romance and marriage with Hema Malini made headlines.Dubbed the \"original He-Man of Bollywood\" and \"Garam (hot) Dharam\", the actor often made it to global lists of \"most handsome men\" in his heyday and female fans were known to sleep with his photographs under their pillows.Bollywood stars weren't immune to his charms either - over the years actress Madhuri Dixit described him as \"one of the most handsome people I have seen on screen\", superstar Salman Khan said Dharmendra was the \"most beautiful looking man\" and actress Jaya Bachchan called him \"a Greek God\".Dharmendra always said he was \"embarrassed\" by talk of his good looks and attributed it to \"nature, my parents and my genes\".Watch: Popular Indian actor Dharmendra receives lifetime achievement awardsBorn on 8 December 1935 in Nasrali village in Punjab's Ludhiana district in a middle-class Jatt-Sikh family, he was named Dharam Singh Deol by his schoolteacher father.In a 2018 interview with BBC Hindi, he said his father wanted him to study, but he fell in love with films early on and wanted to be a hero.\"I watched my first film when I was in the ninth standard and I was hooked. I was wondering, where is this heaven where all these beautiful people live? I thought I must find my way there. I felt like they were mine and I belonged to them.\"But when he told his family, they were appalled.DinodiaDharmendra (right) with Amjad Khan in Sholay\"My mother said, 'you are our eldest child, you have family responsibilities'. I was very sad. So when we heard about the All India Talent Contest by Filmfare magazine, to humour me, she said, 'ok, send in your application'. We didn't think I would be selected.\"But then he won the contest and moved to Bombay (now Mumbai) and the rest, as they say, is history.For three decades - after debuting with Dil Bhi Tera, Hum Bhi Tere (The heart is yours and so am I) in 1960 - he ruled Bollywood, delivering several hits a year.Dharmendra first rose to fame with Bimal Roy's 1963 film Bandini, earning praise for his elegant portrayal of a prison doctor who falls for a convict.He soon became a romantic hero, pairing successfully with top actresses like Nutan, Meena Kumari, Mala Sinha, and Saira Banu.In 1966, he did his first action role in Phool Aur Patthar (Flower and rock), but it was the 1971 hit Mera Gaon Mera Desh (My village, my country) which cemented his reputation as an action hero.Tall and well-built, Dharmendra often did his own action scenes, involving daring stunts, even taking risks.Besides romance and action, the actor also delivered thrillers and comedies that were hits. Critics praised him \"for his impeccable comic timing\" in the hilarious 1975 film Chupke Chupke.DinodiaDharmendra with wife Bollywood actor Hema MaliniOver the years, Dharmendra said he was cast against 70 heroines, but his most successful screen pairing was with Hema Malini, who later became his second wife.The couple first met at a film premiere in 1965 and Hema Malini made an immediate impression on Dharmendra. In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.AFP via Getty ImagesDharmendra with sons Sunny (right) and Bobby Deol (left) at his Mumbai residenceIn his lifetime, the actor gave many fine performances, but if there's one role that he'll always be remembered for, it'll be that of Veeru in Sholay - the 1975 blockbuster that has become a cultural phenomenon.The multi-starrer that also had Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini and Jaya Bachchan in the lead roles saw Dharmendra and Bachchan play loveable rogues-turned-saviours who are recruited to fight a dreaded bandit.The film became a cult classic and many fans credited Dharmendra for its success, describing him as the \"soul of Sholay\". The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.The young girl who became Bollywood's pen-palBut despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".",

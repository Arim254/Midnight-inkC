    "body": "Why have English teams dominated as Real & PSG face play-offs?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham finished fourth in the Champions League but are 14th in the Premier LeagueBySam DruryBBC Sport journalist and Gary RoseBBC Sport journalistThe Premier League is flexing its muscles in Europe as five English teams finished in the top eight of the Champions League to reach the knockouts.That could become six in the last 16 if Newcastle win their two-legged play-off after they finished 12th in the league phase following a 1-1 draw at defending champions PSG on Wednesday.Arsenal finished in first place with Liverpool third, Tottenham fourth, Chelsea sixth and Manchester City finishing eighth.History could be made if Newcastle progress through the play-offs as never before have there been six Premier League teams in the Champions League knockouts.\"That is dominant,\" said Spurs boss Thomas Frank. \"I think we all said for a few years the Premier League is the best league in the world and I think this is another sign of it.\"So why have Premier League sides been so dominant against Europe's elite?Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesFinancial power and physicality?The most obvious starting point is the financial power of the Premier League, which significantly outweighs other leagues.Six Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.TV rights have generated enormous broadcast revenues for Premier League sides, with the income from that source dwarfing those of other countries.Last summer, Premier League clubs outlaid more than ever before in the transfer window as spending surpassed £3bn.To highlight just how much financial power Premier League clubs have over elsewhere in Europe, the total spent in the summer window was more than was spent by Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1 and Serie A clubs combined.More money means clubs can invest in bigger squads, with Arsenal seeing the benefits of spending big to increase their strength in depth as they finished first in the league phase of the Champions League and sit top of the Premier League.\"The biggest single reason that the English clubs have been dominant so far is the financial power of the Premier League,\" former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Sport.\"Also, it is about how competitive they have got by fighting it out and being in and around each other - they have pushed each other on.\"Newcastle forward Anthony Gordon also says a more open style of play in Europe has benefited English teams, while the Premier League is \"more physical than I've ever known it to be\".\"I think in the Champions League, teams are more open. They all try to play. It's less transitional,\" he added.\"It [the Premier League] is like a basketball game sometimes, it's so relentless physically. There's not much control, it's a running game and sometimes it's about duels, whoever wins the duels wins the game. Or moments.\"The Champions League is a bit more of an older style of game, more football based. Teams come and try and play proper football.\"In the Premier League, you see a lot more long throw-ins, set pieces - it's become a lot slower and more set piece based, I would say.\"Did Premier League teams have easier fixtures?It is undoubtedly an impressive achievement for five - and potentially six - Premier League teams to reach the knockouts.But was the fixture computer kinder for them than other teams?At the start of the season, football data statisticians Opta analysed, external every team's Champions League fixtures and ranked them all to work out who had the kindest draw.Arsenal's fixtures were ranked the third easiest, with Tottenham fourth, Liverpool seventh and Chelsea eighth.Manchester City were deemed to have the 14th easiest fixtures while Newcastle - who played defending champions Paris St-Germain - were 32nd in the rankings.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, OptaSlide 1 of 2, Easiest Champions League fixures, On target to be record breakers, but could fatigue hit?The last - and only - time five Premier League teams made it through to the knockouts was in 2017, when Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham all progressed.However just two of those sides - Liverpool and Manchester City - got beyond the last 16, while the Reds went all the way to the final after knocking City out in the quarter-finals.With five Premier League sides finishing in the top eight of this season's league phase, and therefore avoiding the prospect of facing one another in the last-16, there is the chance of a record number of English teams making the quarter-finals.Having numerous English clubs in latter stages of the Champions League is nothing new with four sides progressing to the quarters in both 2007-08 and 2008-09, as well as 2018-19 - leading to an all-English final in 07-08 and 2018-19.No other country have ever had four teams in the quarter-finals - this year England could have as many as six.But the demands of playing in the Premier League alongside the Champions League takes its toll, which is why many managers were relieved to avoid the two extra play-off games.\"I still think it will be very difficult for one of them to go on and win it, just because of how difficult the Premier League is every week - whether you are fighting for the title or for a place in the top four,\" Warnock added.\"Clearly the English clubs are in a good position going into the knockout stages, though. Some of the other big clubs that we thought would peak or start to show better form - like Paris St-Germain for example - have not really got going yet.\"How are other countries doing?Media caption, Benfica keeper scores stoppage time goal to seal win over Real MadridThe three other countries who had teams join English sides in progressing to the knockouts were Germany (Bayern Munich), Spain (Barcelona) and Portugal (Sporting CP).That has left some surprises having to go through via the play-offs, with Paris St-Germain failing to get the win they needed against Newcastle to secure a top-eight spot.Real Madrid, meanwhile, were on the wrong end of a thrilling and dramatic match with Benfica. Real were reduced to nine men while a last-second goal by goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin secured a memorable 4-2 win for Jose Mourinho's side that earned them a play-off spot.Other big sides who are facing the lottery of the play-offs include Italian sides Juventus and Inter Milan, along with Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Spain's Atletico Madrid - who were stunned by Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday.The Norwegians have been the surprise package of the Champions League and their win against Atletico came just eight days after they beat Manchester City.Those results meant they are into the play-offs and have become the first Norwegian side to progress from the league or group phase in Champions League since Rosenborg in 1996-97.Champions League highlightsMedia caption, Spurs see off Frankfurt to secure automatic last-16 spotMedia caption, Joao Pedro scores superb double to give Chelsea top-eight finishMedia caption, Man City avoid play-offs with win against GalatasarayMedia caption, Salah scores Liverpool's third in victory over QarabagMedia caption, Newcastle come from behind to draw with holders PSGMedia caption, Arsenal maintain perfect record with narrow win over KairatWatch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "body": "Girl, 12, tells court she was strangled and then rapedJust nowVanessa PearceWest MidlandsBBCAhmad Mulakhil and Mohammad Kabir deny committing offences against the youngster in Nuneaton A 12-year-old girl alleged to have been strangled by one man and raped by another has told a court she thought she was \"going to die\" because she could not breathe.The prosecution told the trial at Warwick Crown Court that Mohammad Kabir tried to strangle the girl as he attempted to abduct her in Nuneaton in July, before Ahmad Mulakhil sexually assaulted her a few hours later.\"After he strangled me I ran off,\" jurors heard as part of her video evidence. Mulakhil, 23, has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of raping a child under the age of 13, but denies two further counts, as well as other charges. Fellow Afghan national Kabir, 24 denies all charges, including attempted abduction. Opening the case for the prosecution, Daniel Oscroft told the jury Mulakhil had initially denied all allegations of rape and \"maintained what happened was consensual and initiated by her\".He said the two men appeared to be friends and targeted the 12-year-old in the early evening of 22 July 2025.\"Mohammad Kabir did so by trying to get her to come with him - which is the attempted abduction of a child - and also grabbing her by the neck, strangling her,\" he said.\"This is a legal definition, it doesn't necessarily mean he choked her.\"'Young and vulnerable'Kabir was with Mulakhil at the time, the court heard. \"The prosecution suggests that Mohammad Kabir, when he tried to take her away, can only have had some sexual purpose. What alternative could there have been?\" Oscroft told the jury.\"While she didn't go with Mr Kabir, the other person there, Ahmad Mulakhil, remained in the area for the next few hours, and later met her.\"He talked to her and led her away to a secluded cul-de-sac, Cheverel Place, where he raped her, sexually assaulted her and took indecent images of her.\"Mulakhil had \"repeatedly insisted\" the girl went with him voluntarily, adding he believed she looked like she was aged in her 20s. But it would have been \"obvious to anyone that she was a very young, vulnerable child,\" said Oscroft.The court heard Kabir is alleged to have strangled the girl, who had been playing in a park, at about 18:00 BST.She was then seen talking to Mulakhil at about 20:00, when she is said to have claimed to be aged 19.Oscroft told jurors the girl's claim was \"such an obvious lie\" that it was clear from Mulakhil's reaction that he did not believe her.Mulakhil was also in contact with Kabir, the prosecution added, and their discussions appeared to be about their alleged victim.The court heard she was \"forced\" to engage in sexual acts, and had disclosed on the same night as the attack that she had also been \"smacked and pulled\". Mulakhil's phone was seized after his arrest, jurors were told, and indecent images and images of the two defendants together were found, confirming they were well known to each other.Oscroft said investigators also found Mulakhil's DNA on the girl's neck and on the inside of her clothing.Mulakhil, denies child abduction, two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and taking indecent photographs of a child.Kabir, also of no fixed address, denies intentional strangulation, committing an offence with intent to commit a sexual offence and attempted abduction.Additional reporting by PA MediaRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentOtherNearly 100 children were harmed by a Great Ormond Street Hospital limb reconstruction surgeon, a review has found.The investigation, published by the world-famous London hospital into Yaser Jabbar, found widespread evidence of unacceptable practice in the botched operations he carried out.Jabbar worked at the hospital between 2017 and 2022, providing care to 789 children – 94 of them came to harm, GOSH's report concluded.Most of those – 91 – were patients he did surgery on. He specialised in limb-lengthening and reconstruction for children with complex problems.The BBC has attempted to contact Jabbar. The hospital said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused.The treatments he provided, which included inserting metal plates, bone grafts and implants, are considered high-risk and some level of complications are to be expected.GOSH said it could not determine whether all the cases of harm were avoidable, but Jabbar's practice was substandard in many areas and this had undoubtedly caused harm.Constant painThe report highlighted cases of premature removal of bone fixation devices, operations carried out without a clear rationale, problems with how bones were pinned and making cuts into bones at the wrong level. The way complications were identified and managed was also criticised.More than a quarter of patients he operated on came to harm, the report said. Thirty-five had suffered severe harm. Another child suffered severe harm, but that was not related to surgery.The report did not detail individual cases, but families have previously spoken about the problems their children have experienced. FamilyBunty underwent multiple surgeries and her lower left leg was eventually amputatedOne girl, Bunty, who was born with a rare bone disease that caused her left leg to be bowed and short, was operated on multiple times by Jabbar and eventually had to have her lower leg amputated. This was classed as causing moderate harm.Her father, Dean Stalham, said the findings were \"too little, too late\" and the problems should have been spotted earlier.Lizzie Roberts, whose son Tate was operated on by Jabbar when he was 16 to treat the complications of a road accident 10 years previously, said the hospital had effectively \"marked its own homework\".Lizzie Roberts and Dean Stalham have both called for the police to investigate the caseShe says her son has been left in constant pain after having an unnecessary operation on his ankle that they did not consent to. The surgery was only meant to be on his knee, she says.He is now facing more surgery and has had to drop out of college. His case was also classed as one of moderate harm.Both families have asked the police to launch an investigation into the case. The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it would review the findings of the report to see if that should happen.Jabbar, who trained in the UK, is now understood to live abroad and no longer has a licence to practise medicine in the UK. Bleakest dayGOSH launched this investigation in 2024, bringing in independent doctors to review patient records, although the hospital itself pulled together their findings and have published them.The investigation was initiated after the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) carried out a review on behalf of the hospital. It came after concerns were raised by a member of staff.That review  said there were serious concerns in relation to working culture, with some staff upset about the standard of care and saying the environment was \"toxic\" and that some surgery done on children was \"inappropriate\" and \"incorrect\".Getty ImagesNHS England's London region is now carrying out a review into GOSH's handling of the case.GOSH said it had already acted on recommendations made by the RCS report, including introducing training on handling complaints, investing more in whistle-blowing support for staff and getting surgeons to discuss the most complex cases they are seeing with the National Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.Before the concerns were raised in June 2022, the trust said it had received seven complaints about Jabber and looked into one serious incident, its handling of which was signed off by NHS England. The trust insists none of these suggested further investigation or action was needed.But a surgeon who worked in the same service as Jabbar – Sarah McMahon – is reported to have raised concerns to GOSH management in autumn 2021, but said nothing was done to address her warnings at the time, according to a statement made in parliament by her local MP Dame Meg Hillier.GOSH chief executive Matthew Shaw acknowledged this was the bleakest day in the history of the hospital.He said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused, but insisted the hospital had acted \"incredibly quickly\" once concerns were raised.He said in areas like this, which were hyper-specialised and where there were only a small number of surgeons in the NHS, it was harder to detect problems with practice.But he added in publishing these findings he hoped the hospital could \"starting building trust with families again because they rely on us for many of the things that their children need\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoYasmin RufoLeicester SquareGetty ImagesChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo have been close friends for many yearsChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo are no strangers to sharing the screen, having previously starred together in Marvel films such as Thor and Hulk.Now the pair have reunited for a very different type of film.They are starring alongside each other in Crime 101, a tense thriller that swaps superhero spectacle for a game of psychological cat and mouse.Speaking at the premiere, Hemsworth told the BBC that their long-standing friendship brought both energy and challenges to the set.\"The two of us get together and we're like a couple of naughty kids at school that need to be wrangled to be focused,\" he said. In the film, Hemsworth plays an elusive jewel thief planning one final heist, while Ruffalo stars as a determined detective intent on catching him.While the pair are well known for their comedic chemistry, Crime 101 marks a shift into darker territory.\"We have a familiarity in the comedic space,\" Hemsworth said. \"This is a dramatic film so it was quite an adjustment and discomfort at first.\"Getty ImagesMonica Barbaro (second left), Halle Berry (third left), and Barry Keoghan (second right) also star in Crime 101 Ruffalo said Crime 101 gave Hemsworth the opportunity to take on a very different type of role from those that audiences may be used to seeing.\"I got to see him do something I've been dying to see him do that I know he can do but hadn't had the director to help him,\" the 58-year-old actor said. \"When I saw him walk on set, I didn't recognise him, he was totally transformed and I thought this is what I want to see you do.\" The Poor Things actor revealed that the pair had been discussing working together outside the Marvel universe for years.\"We've been talking about doing a project for years,\" he said. \"I love him and we have a really close relationship. We always see each other and ask, 'What are we going to do together?'\"Ruffalo said it was Hemsworth who first approached him about the film.\"Chris reached out to me immediately. I read the script and thought, absolutely,\" he said.Getty ImagesBerry plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heistStarring alongside Hemsworth and Ruffalo is Halle Berry, who plays an insurance broker who gets entangled in the heist. The 59-year-old said her character showed that \"women of a certain age are not indispensable and resists that by standing up for herself\". That mentality is very similar to how Berry sees herself, telling the BBC she is focused on \"building a company to help women going through perimenopause\", which she was diagnosed with in her early 50s.The American actor says she is \"always\" being pigeonholed into a certain role due to her age but she \"resists at every turn\". Berry is set to play President Joanna Duncan, a gender-swapped version of the lead role from the The President is Missing, a political thriller novel by Bill Clinton. \"It's my fantasy to have a female American president and I would love to see a woman lead the country and I hope to get to see that in my lifetime but at least I get to play one.\" 'Grit and authenticity'Crime 101 features all the classic car chases and stunts you'd imagine from an old school crime thriller and Hemsworth said that was one of the most enjoyable parts of filming. \"The stunts were intense for all the right reasons - you have the adrenaline pumping and you're like a big kid, and that's what I love about doing those films.\" The Australian actor joked that his upbringing \"on farms where we were bashing about in old cars\" helped prepare him for the car chasing stunts. Avoiding stunt doubles and green screen added to the film's authenticity, according to Hemsworth. \"It is really us experiencing those emotions so there's an added layer of grit and authenticity,\" he said. Outside of acting, Hemsworth has been throwing himself into new challenges, from fitness experiments to learning new skills.His Limitless documentary sees him explore ways to live longer and healthier and as part of the show which aired last summer he learnt to play drums, eventually performing live with Ed Sheeran. National GeographicHemsworth joined Ed Sheeran on stage in Romania last year after learning to play the drums\"I had planned to continue the drumming,\" he said, \"but that period was so intense I get PTSD when I see a drum set.\"With three children, he said he knew he should return to it \"for my brain health\", but suggested his brief moment on stage might remain a one-off.\"Ed Sheeran is doing a tour in Australia and he said he'd come get me and three beers into that conversation I agreed. \"I thought about it again when I was sober and told him I'm not doing that again. I've done it once and checked that box.\" ",

    "body": "19 minutes agoMetropolitan PoliceVincent Chan is already in prison after he admitted a series of offences last yearA former nursery worker who has admitted sexually abusing young children in his care in north London has pleaded guilty to a further 30 charges.In December, Vincent Chan, 45, pleaded guilty to 26 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault by touching and making indecent images depicting the most severe category of child sex abuse.At Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Thursday, Chan pleaded guilty to charges which include ten counts of taking indecent photographs of children, six of outraging public decency, sexual assault on a female, and nine counts of voyeurism.  He will be sentenced on 12 February for all offences that he has now admitted.Warning: This article contains distressing detailsThe new charges relate to seven women and girls.The court heard they include filming up the skirts of girls as they sat in a classroom in north London.The charges he admitted in December include molesting girls aged three and four while working at the Bright Horizons nursery in Finchley Road, West Hampstead, north London. He worked there for seven years until he was suspended in 2024, after a colleague raised concerns about his activities with the children.The whistleblower complained that Chan had filmed a child falling asleep and set the footage to music, in a bid to entertain his colleagues.The Metropolitan Police investigation that followed unearthed Chan's collection of more than 25,000 indecent images of children.Among them were videos taken by Chan himself as he sexually assaulted some of the children at the nursery while they were sleeping at naptime.Police also recovered images showing him exposing himself in a classroom in 2017, as well as videos, believed to be of Chan, depicting a solo sex act.He has also admitted a campaign of voyeurism between 2011 and 2023.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe European boss of Fujitsu, the company which built the IT system at the heart of the Post Office Horizon scandal, is to step down in March.Europe chief executive Paul Patterson, 60, will become non-executive chairman of Fujitsu's UK business, where he will \"continue managing the company's response\" to the inquiry into the scandal.The announcement is part of a long-planned transition, and Patterson is expected to stay with the company until the inquiry process is complete.Patterson has played a prominent role in Fujitsu's response to the Horizon scandal, representing the company at the public inquiry into the affair, and at House of Commons select committee hearings.He has been criticised for the firm's decision not to pay compensation to victims until the inquiry has published its final report.The Horizon IT system, which began operating in 1999, falsely created shortfalls in Post Office branches for which sub-postmasters were held liable.More than 900 people were prosecuted, and some went to prison, in what has been called the one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. Some died while waiting for their names to be cleared and compensation paid.The first report from the official inquiry into the scandal found it may have led to more than 13 people taking their own lives.Fujitsu has agreed in principle to contribute to compensation for victims, but it has consistently refused to agree a sum or make any payment until the final report from the inquiry is published.This is expected later this year.Former sub-Postmaster Tim Brentnall from Pembrokeshire was wrongly convicted in 2010 of false accounting after Horizon made a shortfall appear in his branch accounts. His conviction was overturned in 2021, but he is still waiting for final compensation.Paul Patterson \"tries to say all the right things but does nothing,\" he said. \"It seems they are waiting for the inquiry to see what they have to do, rather than doing what they should do,\" Brentnall added.He welcomed the fact that Patterson is staying on to deal with Horizon issues. \"It's good to have that continuity regardless of what you think of his performance,\" he said. \"The last thing anyone wants is something like this to cause further delays.\"Patterson joined Fujitsu in 2010 and became Europe chief executive in 2019, the same year Alan Bates and the sub-Postmasters won their landmark case at the High Court.Speaking to the Inquiry in 2024, he apologised on behalf of Fujitsu \"for our part in this appalling miscarriage of justice\".He admitted there were \"bugs, errors and defects\" in the Horizon system which were well known \"right from the very start\".Earlier this month, Patterson defended the fact the company had been given £500m worth of extensions on government contracts, despite its decision not to bid for new work in the wake of the scandal.\"We are not a parasite, the government has got an option as to whether they wish to extend those contracts or not,\" he said.Patterson will be replaced by Mikihito Saito, the company's current head of international business. The current UK boss Anwen Owen will report to him.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPhil Mackie,at Birmingham Crown CourtandAida Fofana,West MidlandsLeo Ross was stabbed to death on his way home from schoolA 15-year-old boy has pleaded guilty to murdering 12-year-old Leo Ross as he walked home from school in Birmingham last year.The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, entered his plea on Thursday at Birmingham Crown Court.Leo was thought to have been making his way home from his school in Yardley Wood, Birmingham, when he was stabbed in the stomach on 21 January 2025.At 12 years old, he is believed to be the youngest victim of knife crime in the West Midlands.Members of the public came to help him as he lay on a riverside path in a park and called the emergency services but Leo died in hospital.His family said he had been walking a 10-minute route home and police said he was speaking to a friend on the phone, arranging to meet near a certain tree in Trittiford Mill Park.His friend turned up but Leo never did.His foster family described him as \"the sweetest, kindest boy who put others before himself.\"\"He was loved by all that knew him, he made friends with everyone he met, young or old,\" they added.Leo's birth mother, Rachel Fisher, said her son \"didn't have a bad bone in his body\".\"My baby's life was stolen for no reason whatsoever, my life will never be the same again without him,\" she said.Leo is believed to be the youngest victim of knife crime in the West MidlandsThe defendant, who was 14 at the time of the stabbing, also pleaded guilty to two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, over separate attacks on three elderly women.Those victims were pushed to the ground, hit by him and suffered serious injuries, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.Detectives found the knife used in the stabbing had been thrown into a nearby river - the teenager pleaded guilty to possession of a bladed article.Investigators also discovered that the killer opted to hang around to talk to officers at the murder scene, falsely claiming he had stumbled across Leo lying fatally injured beside the River Cole.Leo had no connection to his attacker, police believe, and he was subjected to what senior officers described as a completely random and unprovoked stabbing.The boy showed no remorse and gave no explanation during his interview, only saying \"no comment\" when asked about Leo's murder and the earlier assaults, police said.The defendant's guilty pleas were entered more than six months after a trial was postponed to allow psychiatric experts to assess the defendant.Judge Paul Farrer KC said sentencing would be set for 10 February and, in the meantime, the 15-year-old would be remanded into youth detention.Acting head teacher Tim Boyes said Leo was lovable and brightLeo was a pupil at Christ Church C of E Secondary Academy and Tim Boyes, their acting head at the time of the stabbing, said his death had a huge impact on staff and pupils.He recalled the moment the school got a call to say a student had been stabbed.\"I jumped in the car and was at the scene whilst paramedics and police were just beginning to deal with the horrible crisis,\" he said.Boyes said he remembered Leo as \"a quirky, lovable, bright, unusual little boy\".\"For a 12-year-old, he was quite young and he had a naivety and simplicity,\" he said.Boyes said unlike many boys his age who were into football, Leo was \"passionate about fossils\".Flowers were left at the scene of the stabbing along with written messages which included saying Leo was \"loved by many people\" and \"our lives won't be the same without you\".Speaking after Thursday's hearing, Jonathan Roe, from the CPS, called the stabbing a \"senseless act of violence\" that \"robbed a 12-year-old boy of his life\".Det Insp Joe Davenport thanked members of the community who tried to save Leo's life.\"This was a heartbreaking and senseless attack on a young boy who was completely innocent,\" he said.At the hearing, the teenager also denied charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 22 October 2024 and assault by beating on 29 December 2024 in relation to two more victims and those charges were ordered to lie on file.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "9 minutes agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestBBCInaayah Makda was struck by a wave as she sat on rocks on a beach in CasablancaA seven-year-old British girl is missing after being swept out to sea on the first day of a family holiday in Morocco.Inaayah Makda, from Blackburn in Lancashire, was hit by a large wave as she and her parents sat on rocks on a beach in Casablanca on Wednesday, her family have said. Her parents Zubair and Tasneem Makda were also knocked into the sea but lost sight of their daughter. A family member said the couple had spent hours on the beach screaming her name but had received little help from the authorities. Zubair and Tasneem, described as hard-working professionals, were on their first night of a week-long family holiday when it happened. A relative, who did not wish to be named, said the tide appeared to be a long way out when they first arrived on the beach but came in very quickly - within about 20 minutes - catching them by surprise. \"There were no warnings or signs there for tourists,\" she said. 'We're devastated'The family ended up cut off and surrounded by water, when a wave knocked Inaayah one way and her parents the other, the relative said.She disappeared from view before her father could reach her. The parents, who are still in Casablanca, have reportedly turned to a private search operator with a helicopter to assist with the search. A neighbour of the family, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Inaayah, a pupil at Roe Lee Park Primary School in Blackburn, was a \"lovely, bubbly, cheeky little girl\".She said she was the only child of her \"hardworking\" parents, and was \"their whole world\".\"We're all just in shock. We're devastated,\" she said.Gillian Wilton, head teacher at Roe Lee Park Primary School, Blackburn, said: \"We are extremely upset to hear the news of Inaayah Makda, who is currently missing in Morocco.\"Our immediate and heartfelt thoughts are with her, her parents and family at this devastating time.\"We will continue to pray for Inaayah's safe return and know that all our school community will have her in their thoughts and prayers.\"The school would also like to offer our continued support to our pupils and parents.\"She asked that parents contact the school if they needed any help and support. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussein said he was \"heartbroken\" by the incident and had been in touch with Inaayah's family. He said: \"I am urgently raising this matter with the UK authorities, including the Foreign Office, to ensure every possible step is being taken to support the search efforts and to provide the family with all the assistance they require at this deeply distressing time.\"A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said it was \"supporting the family of a British national reported missing in Morocco\" and was \"in contact with local authorities\".More like this",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesCivil servants who have been left in financial hardship because of delays receiving their pensions are being offered interest-free loans of up to £10,000.Cabinet Office Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds told MPs the waits faced by retired civil servants were \"completely and utterly unacceptable\".The government said around 8,500 people have had issues with pension payments since Capita took over the administration of the Civil Service Pension Scheme in December.The company has apologised to those affected, saying it inherited a backlog of 86,000 cases.Appearing in front of MPs on Parliament's Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Thomas-Symonds said he had signed off on hardship loans, which would be administered by government departments.Catherine Little, chief operating officer for the Civil Service, told the committee the standard level for the loans would be £5,000, with up to £10,000 for exceptional cases.A joint statement from Capita and Little said: \"This is not the service members deserve. \"Capita and the Cabinet Office are deeply sorry for the worry, frustration and distress this has caused - particularly for those dealing with bereavement or ill health.\"They said the most urgent cases, for example those experiencing bereavement, ill-health or hardship would be prioritised, with those expected to be dealt with by the end of February. More than 150 additional staff have been brought in to Capita to clear the backlog, bringing the total workforce to more than 650.Those experiencing financial hardship are advised to contact their former department directly for support, if they retired within the last 12 months.Those who left more than 12 months ago should contact Capita.'It's been hell'Sandra Jackson, 59 and from Wiltshire, retired from the civil service because of ill health in March 2025 and her payment was due in November.She said all the paperwork had been signed off but after Capita took over the service she never received the money.\"It's just been hell,\" she told the BBC, adding that she had been forced to borrow money from her mum to cover her bills.\"She can't loan me anymore this month, so this month we're just struggling alone.\"Sandra suffers from chronic fatigue and said not being able to sleep due to stress had \"massively set me back\".Sandra JacksonSandra has had to borrow money to pay her billsAnthony Price, 58, retired from the prison service last June for health reasons and had agreed a compensation payment because he was unable to continue working there because of his condition.However, despite multiple calls to Capita, waiting on hold for more than four hours, he has still not received the money.Anthony, from St Helens, told the BBC he had been forced to borrow money from family to cover his rent and bills.With his wife also unwell, Anthony said the issue had caused them a huge amount of stress and was affecting his mental health.\"I've not been able to cope. It's keeping me awake,\" he said.\"Christmas and New Year were cancelled - we couldn't do anything.\"After his MP intervened in his case, Anthony was told he would be paid within five days.But he fears if he has to wait any longer he will not be able to pay his rent and could lose his home.Anthony said the offer of an interest-free loan from government was \"too little, too late\" as he had already been forced to borrow money for January and February.\"It's so embarrassing,\" he said. \"I shouldn't be feeling like this.\"The PCS union, which represents civil servants, is calling for a compensation scheme to cover interest on overdue payments, additional financial costs caused by delays and the distress and inconvenience suffered by pensioners.The union's general secretary Fran Heathcote said: \"This situation continues to cause serious financial and emotional hardship for people who have worked and paid into their pensions all their lives. Pensioners should not have to wait months for money they are legally entitled to receive.\"The government must ensure the Civil Service Pension Scheme is properly resourced and preferably brought back in house.\"Until the end of November 2025, the scheme was administered by a company called MyCSP. The contract was taken over by Capita on 1 December, in a seven-year deal worth £239m.MPs on the Public Accounts Committee warned in October there was a risk Capita would not be ready to take over administration of the scheme as planned in December.Capita said that when it took over it had expected a backlog of 37,000 cases but the actual number was 86,000.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoKevin Peachey,Cost of living correspondentandEmer Moreau,Business reporterGetty ImagesWomen affected by changes to the state pension age have reacted with fury after ministers again rejected their claim for compensation.The government reconsidered the case after a new document came to light, but has again concluded no compensation should be paid.Campaigners say 3.6 million women born in the 1950s were not properly informed of the rise in their state pension age, which brought it into line with men.The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group said the latest decision demonstrated \"utter contempt\" for those affected.SUPPLIEDAngela Madden has been leading the Waspi campaign for yearsAngela Madden, who chairs the group, told BBC News that the decision was \"appalling\".\"We know it's a political choice. We know the government could pay us if it wanted to,\" she said.The group was seeking legal advice about the decision, she added.\"We're not frightened of the government. We're not frightened of legal action.\"The government said the vast majority of 1950s-born women already knew the state pension age was increasing, thanks to a wide range of public information, including through leaflets, education campaigns, in GP surgeries, on TV and radio, in cinemas, and online.Others, however, said they were unaware of the changes.In 2024, a parliamentary ombudsman recommended compensation of between £1,000 and £2,950 each for those affected.While the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO) could recommend compensation, it could not enforce it and the government rejected it.  Speaking in the House of Commons, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said the government accepted that \"individual letters about changes to the state pension age could have been sent earlier\".He repeated the apology given by his predecessor Liz Kendall over when the letters were sent.But he said the government also agreed with the Ombudsman's previous finding that \"women did not suffer any direct financial loss from the delay\".The emergence of a 2007 survey, which had not been handed to Kendall, prompted a review of the government's decision, with McFadden promising to check no other documents had been overlooked.Now, the government has said a flat-rate compensation scheme for those affected would \"cost up to £10.3bn and would simply not be right or fair given it would be paid to the vast majority who were aware of the changes\".More individual compensation \"would not be practical to set up\", it said.McFadden said on Thursday that overall, the evidence suggests that most of those affected would not have read \"an unsolicited pensions letter, even if it had been sent earlier\".He also said that those who knew the least about pensions — \"the very women who most needed to engage with a letter\" — were the least likely to read it.Pat PollingtonPat Pollington says the Waspi campaign will go onPat Pollington, 71, said state pension changes meant she worked for years longer than she had expected.She described the government's handling of the situation as a \"fiasco\", but said she was \"not in the least surprised\" by Thursday's decision.She added that compensation looks expensive, but is only a drop in the ocean for the government, which she said is focused on the wrong priorities.'Dashed hope'The Conservatives accused the government of \"cynical politics\", while Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Steve Darling MP said affected women will feel \"utterly betrayed\" by the decision.\"False hope was given to them in the autumn, and so that hope has been dashed,\" he said.Ann Davies MP, the work and pensions spokesperson for Plaid Cymru, said: \"The changes to the state pension age were poorly communicated, rushed through, and fundamentally unfair.\"An apology without compensation is not justice and these women deserve far more than words.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesThe ponds become very popular in hot weatherA charity's legal challenge against rules allowing trans people to use the single-sex facilities at Hampstead Heath's swimming ponds cannot proceed at the High Court, a judge has ruled.Sex Matters took legal action against the City of London Corporation, which operates the men's, ladies' and mixed bathing ponds in north London.It said the policy of allowing trans people to use the facilities for the gender with which they identify amounted to sex discrimination.But Mrs Justice Lieven dismissed the challenge, saying the \"appropriate forum\" for the claim is the county court rather than the High Court.Getty ImagesThe pools date back to the 18th CenturyCampaign group Sex Matters filed for a judicial review, arguing the corporation's policy was unlawful based on the April 2025 Supreme Court ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the 2010 Equality Act.Tom Cross KC, for the charity, said at a hearing in December that the rules treat an individual woman \"less favourably\" than an individual man, as they are at \"greater risk of suffering the detriment of her privacy, dignity or safety being compromised\".He said the City of London Corporation should change its policy after the Supreme Court ruling.Getty ImagesThe pools get very busy in summerDaniel Stilitz KC, for the corporation, said the claim should have been dismissed for being out of time because the current policy has been in place since 2017.He described the legal action as \"unhelpful, premature and the wrong way for doing these things\".A consultation run by the City of London Corporation and published on Thursday found that nearly 90% of respondents backed trans-inclusive access to the ponds.'Deeply unjust'More than 38,000 people took part in the consultation over a period of two months.Of those, 84% of respondents to the consultation had swum at the bathing ponds and 74% lived in London, the City of London said.Six options were considered for the Kenwood Ladies, Highgate Men's and Hampstead mixed ponds, with 86% of respondents supporting the existing trans-inclusive access arrangements.A similar proportion also opposed introducing strict single-sex access, while 90% rejected requiring trans swimmers to use separate changing rooms or have separate swimming sessions, and 66% opposed making all ponds mixed sex.Getty ImagesSex Matters released a statement to say it was \"disappointed\" in the decision and was \"considering its legal options\".The group's CEO Maya Forstater said: \"The fight for women's safety, privacy and dignity in single-sex spaces will continue. Just because this particular claim was ruled out on procedural grounds does not give any service provider the green light to allow trans-identifying males into female facilities.\"The City's policy and its unwillingness to defend the lawfulness of that policy in court simply pushes the risk of harassment and the cost and difficulty of taking legal cases on to individual women and members of staff. This is deeply unjust.\"Getty ImagesTrans-led advocacy and human rights organisation TransLucent said it was \"unacceptable taxpayer money is wasted by relentless legal assaults from a powerful, well-funded minority who are determined to exclude trans people and, as a by-product, cause havoc in feminism, when there are so many more important issues that women face on a daily basis.\"Trans inclusion is the norm across the country; now, the government must provide decisive legal clarity, empowering service providers to act inclusively without being held hostage to costly litigation.\"Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the City of London Corporation said: \"We note the court's decision.\"This case has required significant time and resources, which could otherwise be focused on managing Hampstead Heath as a charity and providing high-quality public services.\"We have now published the results of a consultation on future access arrangements at the heath's bathing ponds.\"The findings will be presented to City Corporation committees, which will consider them alongside legal duties, equality impact assessments, safeguarding responsibilities and operational considerations.\"In the meantime, the current admission rules will remain in place until a final decision has been made by members.\"Further announcements will be made in due course.\"More stories on Hampstead Heath's swimming pondsRelated internet links",

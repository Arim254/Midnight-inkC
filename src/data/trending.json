    "body": "12 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterWatch: BBC political correspondent Damian Grammaticas explains why the site of the new embassy is controversialThe UK has approved China's plans for a huge new embassy in central London, despite opponents warning it could be used as a base for spying and pose security risks.Security Minister Dan Jarvis said intelligence agencies had been \"integral\" to the process and he was \"content any risks are being appropriately managed\".The decision, which has repeatedly been delayed, had posed a challenge for the government, as it seeks to balance its desire for closer ties with Beijing with warnings of the threat posed by China.It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is expected to visit Beijing early this year, becoming the first UK prime minister to do so since 2018. In a letter, the housing department confirmed that Housing Secretary Steve Reed, who is responsible for planning policy, had given permission for the development to go ahead, subject to certain conditions.The site at Royal Mint Court is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables that carry vast quantities of highly sensitive data, sparking concerns they could be used by China to infiltrate the UK's financial system.However, in its decision letter, the department said there was no suggestion the use of the site as an embassy would interfere with the cables.It added that no bodies with responsibility for national security, including the Home Office and the Foreign Office, had raised concerns or objected to the proposal on the basis of the proximity of the cables.Jarvis told MPs the government had \"acted to increase the resilience of cables in the area through an extensive series of measures to protect sensitive data\".The minister argued that the development brought \"clear national security advantages\", by consolidating China's diplomatic premises from seven sites into a single location.In a joint letter to the home secretary and foreign secretary about the embassy plans, MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum and GCHQ's director Anne Keast-Butler said it was \"not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk\".However, they added a \"proportionate\" package of national security mitigations had been developed for the site. Conditions on the planning approval include that the development must begin within three years, and a steering group of local bodies should be established to manage protests outside the site. BBC visits the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyOpposition parties and some Labour MPs had called for the project to be blocked. Local residents also oppose the plans and are planning a legal challenge.Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \"Keir Starmer has sold off our national security to the Chinese Communist Party with his shameful super embassy surrender.\"Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said the decision would \"amplify China's surveillance efforts here in the UK and endanger the security of our data - not to speak of the safety of the brave Hong Kongers on British soil\".He added that it was \"categorically wrong\" that the prime minister had \"embraced these threats to further his flirtation with China\".Reform UK said the decision was \"a serious threat to national security\" and \"a desperate attempt by the Labour government to cosy up to the Chinese Communist Party\". China tiesEmbassies act as the headquarters for a country's representatives abroad. Downing Street said they were \"the first line of communication\" between nations and \"those who don't accept this basic premise are either naive or recklessly isolationist\".At 20,000 square metres, China's proposed new London embassy would be the biggest of its kind anywhere in Europe.Approval for the site has long been a priority for China's government, which bought the site for £255m in 2018.The plans were initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety concerns, but when China resubmitted its application in 2024 the government took over the decision.Meanwhile, the UK is waiting for its own £100m plan to redevelop the British embassy in Beijing to be approved by China's authorities.Rejecting China's plans would have risked setting back diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since winning power, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves among several senior government figures to visit the country.However, critics have argued the threat of spying by the Chinese state and its intimidation against dissidents abroad are reasons for a more cautious relationship.",

And dog activist.\" That's how Nicola Peltz Beckham describes herself in her Instagram bio.The 31-year-old wife of Brooklyn Beckham has found herself in the centre of a media maelstrom following her husband's explosive social media post taking aim at his A-list parents, Sir David and Lady Beckham.While she has risen to prominence since her marriage to the Beckhams' eldest child, Peltz is otherwise known for her acting career and famous parents - billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz and model Claudia Heffner.Her father is a founding partner of an investment management fund based in New York and was previously the director of several global brands including Heinz.Her mother was a successful model in the 1980s and 1990s and the couple went on to have eight children. They have now been together for more than 40 years.Nicola grew up in New York, and, in a 2019 interview, said her parents tried to put her off her dream career of acting.\"I grew up playing ice hockey, and my dad really wanted me to focus on playing ice hockey, he thought it was so cool. I was centre-right and right-wing,\" she said. \"Then, when I was 11 years old, I asked my mom if I could try acting - it started because I loved my drama class. My parents were very against it [at first]. They didn't get it.\"They relented, and by the time she had landed her first stage role in Blackbird at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 2005, they had come round to the idea.Her film debut had actually come the previous year, when she played Mackenzie in the Christmas comedy Deck the Halls.She went on to land roles in M. Night Shyamalan's The Last Airbender in 2010 and starred as Norman Bates's love interest in the 2013 series, Bates Motel.Getty ImagesPeltz pictured with her father (far left) and brother Will (far right) along with Elon Musk at the premiere of her film LolaShe has also had roles in Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) and Hulu drama When the Street Lights Go On (2017).Her next project is the indie film Prima, where she plays the leading role as a ballerina alongside a cast which also includes Oscar winners Faye Dunaway and Mira Sorvino. The screenplay is based on a story and character created by Peltz Beckham.Nicola has also appeared in music videos, including Zayn Malik's It's You and Miley Cyrus's 7 Things, and has modelled for brands such as Italian outfit Genny.She made her directorial debut with 2024 movie Lola, which she also wrote and starred in. Nicola played the titular character, a young woman trying to save up to get her brother out of the toxic family home.The heiress previously acknowledged criticism she got online for her privileged position.\"I get a lot of mean comments on my Instagram that, unfortunately, I do read, and they always comment, 'She doesn't work,'\" Nicola said.\"And that's fair, and I don't blame them for saying that because it's not like I'm posting my Lola experience every step of the way. But I really have been working on Lola for six years. It's such a massively long process.\"The film received a mixed response and got a 56% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the Guardian review suggesting it \"exploits hardship\".Getty ImagesAside from her career, Nicola is known for encouraging her followers to adopt or foster animals, and she was rewarded with a Peta award in 2022 for being a Pawsome Adoption Advocate.But it was her relationship with Brooklyn that catapulted her into the spotlight, particularly since their lavish wedding in 2022.In an interview with Glamour, he revealed he met his future wife at Coachella and they later got together following a Halloween party.Nicola has frequently spoken of her love and admiration for her parents, including in an interview with Brydie in 2024, in which she also praised her in-laws.\"Family is everything to me, and I mean that with my whole heart,\" she said. \"I'm so close to mine and Brooklyn's family and I think there's no better feeling than knowing you have a strong support system. It's such a blessing, and I never take it for granted.\"While Nicola has continued to publicly praise her family on social media, it was recently reported that she had removed a post congratulating her mother-in-law on her 50th birthday from her profile.The pair are now embroiled in a very public fallout with Sir David and Lady Beckham - after Brooklyn posted an Instagram statement on Monday saying he has no wish to reconcile with his family following a rift.",

    "body": "Shock and confusion as Spain struggles for answers after deadly train crash3 hours agoGuy Hedgecoein Adamuz, southern SpainReutersSpain's King Felipe (far right) visited the crash site with Queen Letizia on TuesdaySunday's high-speed train crash in southern Spain, the worst in over a decade, has been a devastating tragedy for the country, with the loss of at least 42 lives.And amid the grief, many are asking what could have caused such a failure on one of Europe's most admired rail systems.The CIAF rail investigatory commission has started analysing why a train travelling north from Málaga was derailed on a straight section of the route, causing it to collide with an oncoming train, which was also derailed. The Spanish government has described the accident as \"extremely strange\".Three bodies already located in the wreckage were recovered on Tuesday afternoon, and a 42nd victim was also found at the crash site near Adamuz.The shock felt in this sleepy town has been compounded by confusion at how a rail route that ran efficiently for so long suddenly failed.After its inauguration in 1992, Spain's high-speed rail, or AVE, network was seen as a symbol of the country's modernisation. Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decadeSeveral officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".EPAGrieving Spaniards want answers about what caused the deadly crashHowever, investigators are also examining the section of track where the derailment occurred and intend to analyse parts of it in a laboratory. The revelation that part of the track at the crash site was broken has encouraged speculation that this might be the culprit. The government has been keen to play down such conclusions, pointing out that the track may have been damaged by the force of the collision.Some observers have drawn attention to possible underlying factors on the network. It has emerged that rail infrastructure administrator Adif drew attention to eight technical issues on the line near where the accident happened on social media over the last year. Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150-km (93-mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.",

    "body": "6 hours agoWatch: Veronika the cow shows off her unique skillsScientists are rethinking what cattle are capable of after an Austrian cow named Veronika was found to use tools with impressive skill. The discovery, reported by researchers in Vienna, suggests cows may have far greater cognitive abilities than previously assumed.Veronika, a cow living in a mountain village in the Austrian countryside, has spent years perfecting the art of scratching herself using sticks, rakes, and brooms. Word of her behaviour eventually reached animal intelligence specialists in Vienna, who found Veronika used both ends of the same object for different tasks. Antonio J Osuna MascaróVeronika, a Swiss brown cow living in AustriaIf it were her back or another tough area that warranted a good scratch, she would use the bristle end of a broom. When a softer touch was needed, such as on her sensitive underbelly, she would use the smooth handle end.This kind of tool use is rarely seen in the animal kingdom and has never been documented in cattle before.Dr Antonio Osuna-Mascaro of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna said: \"We were not expecting cows to be able to use tools, and we were not expecting a cow to use a tool as a multipurpose tool. Until now this has only been consistently reported in chimpanzees.\"Getty ImagesChimpanzees show sophisticated tool use, such as using a stick to get fruit from a boxChimpanzees show the most varied range of tool use outside of humans. They use sticks to gather ants and termites, and stones to crack nuts.However, despite about 10,000 years of humans living alongside cattle, this is the first time scientists have documented a cow using a tool.The researchers say their discovery shows that cows are smarter than we think and that other cows could develop similar skills, given the chance.As for Veronika's owner, organic farmer Witgar Wiegele, he hopes her unexpected talents will inspire people to value the natural world. As he puts it: \"Save the nature, then you protect yourself. Nature diversity is the key to survive on this planet.\"The study is published in the journal Current Biology.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKeiron TourishBBC News NIBBCJohn Garrett O'Sullivan pictured at a court hearing in July 2024 A man who placed his dead father in a refrigerator has been given a three-year sentence.John Garrett O'Sullivan, from Culmore Road in Londonderry, admitted a charge of preventing the lawful burial of his father between 1 and 18 July 2024.The body of 86-year old Noel O' Sullivan, a retired orthodontist and father-of-three, was found wrapped in a duvet and plastic sheets at the family home.On Tuesday the judge at Londonderry Crown Court told 56-year-old John O'Sullivan he had caused misery to his family.She handed down a three-year sentence, with half to be spent in custody and half on licence.Warning: This court report contains details which some readers may find very distressing. Body found after police forced entryAfter Noel O'Sullivan died, his head was placed into a fridge and his body was surrounded by the open door of a second fridge.There was a large nappy on his head and hands and he had a wet wipe type cloth inserted in his mouth.His body had been lying there for some time.Police said there was an odour when they forced entry to the house after they received a \"concern for safety\" call from the victim's daughter.The body was found in a freezer in the family home on the Culmore Road in DerryJohn O'Sullivan, who has a PhD in engineering, told police he did not call a doctor as his father was already dead and placed his body in a fridge as that was what they did at Altnagelvin Hospital.He also said he did not call anyone after his father had died as he wanted to preserve his privacy and dignity.The court was told he had given \"no comment\" responses to all police interviews. He had no criminal record and was assessed as a medium risk of further offending.Mental health issuesThe prosecution said there were several aggravating features, including the purchase of plastic sheets and bed mats and the fact John O'Sullivan had failed to alert police or others about his father's death and the location of his body. A prosecutor said he also asked the local health service what to do when there was a sudden death but ignored the advice given to him.The defence said John O'Sullivan believed he had delayed the lawful burial of his father, rather than preventing it.A defence solicitor said it was a sad and distressing case, but argued that it was not a case of the deliberate attempt to obstruct justice.He said that the defendant was continuing to engage with the community mental health team.In a statement to police, the defendant said he absolutely denied any wrongdoing or mistreatment of his father.The judge said it was a tragedy for the O'Sullivan family.She said John O'Sullivan had been responsible for the indignity and degradation his father endured and he had caused misery for the family.The court heard details of the defendant's mental health issues, including a nervous breakdown in the 1990s.He slept in the family garage and had a difficult relationship with his father.Distorted view on how to preserve his father's dignityThe judge said it was clear Noel O'Sullivan had had a miserable last few days of his life. She said the defendant had failed to call the emergency services or alert police about his death or disclose the location of his body.The judge said that he had a distorted view on how to preserve his father's dignity. She also said that he had opted to withhold access to his GP notes and recent psychiatric reports.She added that he had caused considerable harm to surviving family members and said he was not to approach any of them without by prior approval.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHugh Schofield,Paris correspondentandPaul Pradier,in ParisFrench officials have made their first interception on the water as part of a new policy aimed at stopping small boats carrying illegal migrants to the UK.A so-called \"taxi-boat\" was boarded by French officers on Saturday on the Aa canal in Gravelines, which is on the Channel coast above Calais.It follows a change of tactics agreed in November following growing pressure from the UK government to step up interventions.A photograph of the aftermath of the operation obtained by the BBC shows a number of men - apparently people-smugglers - on an inflatable dinghy with the police launch alongside. The inflatable is then towed to the dockside.The French maritime prefecture declined to comment to the BBC, saying only that there was \"an ongoing judicial investigation\" regarding the small boat.France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer.Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous.But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using \"taxi-boats\", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard.According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025.The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation.These concerns appear now to have been addressed.  Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.",

    "body": "5 hours ago@andyclay4Counter-terrorism police descended on Sidcup in December 2023A man accused of causing the explosion of an ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) camera in south-east London has told a court he believed he was arrested over anti-Ulez posts he made on Facebook.Kevin Rees, 63, was arrested by counter-terror police after a low-sophistication improvised explosive device (IED) damaged the camera in Willersley Avenue, Sidcup, in December 2023.Rees told Woolwich Crown Court he had no involvement and thought he was being detained because of his participation in \"anti-Ulez\" Facebook groups.Rees denied one count of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property and three counts of possessing prohibited weapons.\"I assumed it was just the so-called Facebook police,\" Rees, giving evidence on Wednesday, told the jury.He said: \"People you hear being arrested for making bad or inappropriate comments on Facebook pages - that's well-known, as it's been on the news. The thing is, I didn't actually do anything wrong.\"When defence counsel Simon Ray asked: \"Are you responsible for that explosion?,\" Rees replied: \"No, I'm not. Not something I would do.\"@andyclay4Rees denies one count of causing an explosionJurors heard the camera had already been damaged earlier that day by a man called Stephen Harwood-Stamper - who later pleaded guilty to criminal damage.Harwood-Stamper cut the camera pole down before someone else caused the camera to explode when it was already on the ground.Rees, a retired domestic appliance service engineer, told jurors he had never spoken to or heard of Harwood-Stamper and first learned of the explosion through a Facebook group for local news.When he was arrested 12 days later, Rees made reference to that explosion and asked officers if his arrest had \"something to do with the anti-Ulez sites\".\"There was only one explosion that was on the news and that was the one in Sidcup,\" Rees told jurors.'Boredom'When interviewed by police on his whereabouts on the evening of December 6, Rees said he was at a friend's house, where he was fitting a new kitchen.However, footage from nearby CCTV cameras showed Rees left his friend's home mid-afternoon and did not return in the evening.He said: \"I was 100% convinced I was at his house - as I still am now, in my head but I have seen CCTV of me leaving the property, so, obviously, I was not there.\"When asked why he was interested in Ulez cameras and the Facebook groups that opposed them, Rees replied: \"Boredom, and, almost, a community.\"I'm retired, not much else to do - didn't particularly interest me that much.\"The prosecution alleged three \"stun guns\" were found at Rees's home following his arrest.The defendant, of Harcourt Avenue in Sidcup, denied they were stun guns and told jurors he had made them because he enjoyed \"tinkering about with electrical devices\" due to his professional background.The trial continues.",

    "body": "Luke Littler won the inaugural Saudi Arabia Darts Masters with an emphatic 8-5 victory over Michael van Gerwen in the final.Littler, who turns 19 on Wednesday, seized control of the match when he raced into a 4-0 lead against the Dutchman.Van Gerwen was able to move within one leg of Littler at 4-3 and 5-4 down but could not forces his way back to the contest.Littler averaged an impressive 104.84, with a much higher checkout rate (61.5%) than Van Gerwen (45.5%).\"Obviously last week it didn't work out in Bahrain but really glad to come over to Saudi Arabia for the first time and be the first winner,\" Littler told ITV4.\"Michael got back into it so I had to find my form again but I'm just really glad to win. As players coming over here, we didn't know what to expect but there's been a brilliant turnout.\"Van Gerwen, who averaged 101.79 but threw two 180s to Littler's six, acknowledged the Warrington teenager's fast start made it difficult for him.\"Being 4-0 down at the beginning of the game didn't really help me but I always keep fighting,\" added the 36-year-old.\"Fair play to him [Littler]. He had a fantastic tournament. Sometimes you have to take it on the chin and move on.\"Players were offered a $200,000 (£149,400) bonus if they could produce a nine-darter but none of the competitors could manage the feat.The two-day event, featuring some of the world's best players was the first to be held in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has strict no-alcohol regulations.It was part of the World Series of Darts, and was held at the 1,000-capacity Global Theater, Riyadh.Nathan Aspinall, who was knocked out by Littler in the semi-finals, said earlier in the day that the crowd at the event \"weren't all there of their own accord\".A PDC spokesperson told BBC Sport the organisation was \"delighted to see such strong interest\" in the Saudi event, and Aspinall's comments were \"reflecting on the fact that this was a first-of-its-kind darts event in the region\".The spokesperson said all spectators attended as ticket-holders or guests, adding: \"As with any new market, the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established darts events such as those in the UK and Europe.\"Saudi Arabia has staged many major sports events in recent years, including Formula 1 and golf, and will host the men's football World Cup in 2034. But the regime has been criticised for its record on human rights and environmental impact.Quarter-finalsMichael van Gerwen 6-4 Stephen BuntingNathan Aspinall 6-4 Man Lok LeungGian van Veen 4-6 Luke LittlerGerwyn Price 6-5 Luke HumphriesSemi-finalsMichael van Gerwen 7-5 Nathan Aspinall Luke Littler 7-5 Gerwyn PriceFinalLuke Littler 8-5 Michael van Gerwen",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura Gozziin KyivReutersZelensky said repelling Monday night's attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m) just in terms of air defence missilesA large Russian aerial strike on Ukraine has left the Ukrainian parliament and half of Kyiv's residential buildings without heating or power as temperatures across the country continue to hover around -10C.President Volodymyr Zelensky, in his evening address on Tuesday, said one million people in the capital remained without power.Drones, ballistic and cruise missiles targeted several locations in Ukraine overnight, including Kyiv, Dnipro in the centre and Odesa in the south.Zelensky said earlier a \"significant number\" of targets had been intercepted. But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent.The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.ReutersAround 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue. It must end as soon as possible,\" said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ on Tuesday.The Kyiv city administration said more than 10,000 people, including nearly 800 children, took refuge in the city's metro stations on Monday night.Many of the high-rise buildings that are often hit by drones do not have shelters, so the deep metro system is still the only place people can seek safety as the thudding sounds of air defence systems ring overhead. President Zelensky said Ukraine had received missiles to repel the overnight attack on Monday, and added they had helped significantly.But he also emphasised the need for air defence systems was still critical. In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. \"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf.\"When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America,\" he said.\"It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles,\" Zelensky stressed. \"In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America.\"Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.",

    "body": "1 hour agoLynette HorsburghNorth WestCheshire PoliceThe CPS said the decision followed a 2025 investigation into new allegations of murder and attempted murderLucy Letby will face no new criminal charges over baby deaths and collapses at hospitals where she worked. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had reviewed evidence into further allegations of murder and attempted murder against nine children at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Liverpool Women's Hospital but \"the evidential test was not met in any of those cases\".Cheshire Police, which submitted the evidence, said the decision was \"not the outcome that we had anticipated\".Former nurse Letby is serving 15 whole-life terms for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven more, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016.Frank Ferguson, head of the CPS's special crime and counter terrorism division, said it had written to the families involved and would offer meetings to explain the decision. He said: \"We received a file of evidence from Cheshire Constabulary in July 2025 asking us to consider further allegations against Lucy Letby, 36, relating to deaths and non-fatal collapses of babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital and Liverpool Women's Hospital.\"Following a thorough review of that evidence, we have decided that no criminal charges should be brought in respect of those further allegations.\"The Crown Prosecution Service considered offences of murder and attempted murder in respect of two infants who died and attempted murder in respect of seven infants who survived.\"We concluded that the evidential test was not met in any of those cases.\"'Respect privacy'The Cheshire force said it was \"confident\" that it held enough evidence.It said in a statement: \"We submitted files for charging decisions in relation to nine babies - for consideration of nine offences of attempted murder and two of murder.\"We believed the evidence submitted met the CPS charging standard.\"The CPS did not agree and despite our representations we must respect the decision that has been made.\"Panorama: Lucy Letby: Who to Believe?The force added: \"There will be some who will feel that this is news worth celebrating. We do not share this view and would ask that people respect the privacy and feelings of the families involved.\"It said it was \"deeply grateful\" to the experts and witnesses who had contributed to the investigation. \"Their input has been invaluable in answering many difficult questions on behalf of the families.\"Cheshire PoliceLucy Letby is serving 15 whole-life termsIt said the announcement does not affect or undermine Letby's convictions for multiple murders and attempted murders of premature babies \"following an extensive investigation and two criminal trials including one of the longest running murder trials in British criminal history and two unsuccessful appeals\".The force said the decision has no impact on Operation Duet - its ongoing investigation into corporate manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter at the Countess of Chester Hospital, which remain separate investigations.Solicitor Tamlin Bolton, from the law firm representing families of babies Letby was convicted of harming or killing, said her crimes have had a lifelong impact.Bolton, from Irwin Mitchell, said: \"Those families we represent continue to be affected by Letby's crimes which she was tried over and convicted of in a court of law.\"The impact of her actions can never be underestimated and will have a life-long effect on our clients.\"There may well be other families upset at today's decision.\"It's important that families with serious concerns about what happened to their babies are now supported so they can receive the answers they deserve.\"'Bid for freedom'A group of campaigners has submitted reports to legal review body the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to try to get Letby's convictions overturned.Barrister Mark McDonald, who is representing the former nurse, said: \"Lucy Letby has always maintained her innocence. She has never hurt a child and never would.\"It is vital that the case is now referred back to the Court of Appeal as a matter of urgency.\"Thirty-one reports have been submitted to the CCRC, compiled by 26 internationally renowned experts, which provide overwhelming evidence that no babies were murdered.\"The reality is that a young innocent woman is in prison for crimes she has not committed.\"David Davis MP, who is backing Letby's bid for freedom, welcomed the CPS's decision.The Conservative MP for Goole and Pocklington posted on X: \"The CCRC must conclude its review quickly and refer the case to the Court of Appeal.\"It has long been my view that any retrial in Lucy Letby's case should happen as quickly as possible.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Scientists have unearthed Australia's oldest known crocodile eggshells which may have belonged to \"drop crocs\" - creatures that climbed trees to hunt prey below.The discovery of the 55-million-year-old eggshells was made in a sheep farmer's backyard in Queensland with the findings published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.The egghells belonged to a long-extinct group of crocodiles known as mekosuchines, who lived in inland waters when Australia was part of Antarctica and South America.Co-author Prof Michael Archer said \"drop crocs\" were a \"bizarre idea\" but some were \"perhaps hunting like leopards - dropping out of trees on any unsuspecting thing they fancied for dinner\".Prof Archer, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales, said mekosuchine crocodiles - which could grow to about five metres - were plentiful 55 million years ago, long before their modern saltwater and freshwater cousins arrived in Australia about 3.8 million years ago.The \"drop croc\" eggshells were discovered several decades ago but only recently analysed with the help of scientists in Spain.\"It's a bizarre idea,\" Prof Archer said of the \"drop crocs\",  but some were probably \"terrestrial hunters in the forests\".The findings add to earlier discoveries of younger mekosuchine fossils - found in 25-million-year-old deposits in another part of Queensland.\"Some were also apparently at least partly semi-arboreal 'drop crocs',\" Prof Archer said.Since the early 1980s, he has been part of a group of scientists excavating a clay pit in Murgon, a small regional town about 270km (168 miles) north-west of Brisbane.Over the decades, it has become known as one of Australia's oldest fossil sites as it used to be surrounded by a lush forest. \"This forest was also home to the world's oldest-known songbirds, Australia's earliest frogs and snakes, a wide range of small mammals with South American links, as well as one of the world's oldest known bats,\" Dr Michael Stein, a co-author of the report, said.Prof Archer recalls how in 1983, he and another colleague \"drove to Murgon, parked the car on the side of the road, grabbed our shovels, knocked on the door and asked if we could dig up their backyard\".\"After explaining the prehistoric treasures that might lie under their sheep paddock and that fossil turtle shells had already been found in the area, they grinned and said 'of course!'.\"And, quite clearly, from the many fascinating animals that we've already found in this deposit since 1983, we know that with more digging there will be a lot more surprises to come.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoPhilip James LynchLocal Democracy Reporting ServiceLDRSLoretta Alvarez said she is unable to pay the fineA woman from west London has been fined £1,000 by her local council for fly-tipping an envelope outside her flat in Feltham.Loretta Alvarez, 26, said the communal bins - shared with about 25 other properties - were full, so she placed the cardboard envelope on top of cardboard next to the bins.Ms Alvarez, who is a single mother, said she cannot afford to pay and is now being threatened with legal action.Hounslow Council said fly tipping was defined as leaving waste anywhere in public apart from in a bin, regardless of whether bins are full. LDRSOnly the envelope was left by Ms Alvarez, she said, not the boxes Ms Alvarez said she would \"never intentionally\" leave rubbish out in the open. \"It's been so stressful. I didn't want this to happen, I wouldn't want it to happen to someone else,\" she said.\"I've been trying to juggle this alongside work and being a mum - it's been hard.\"She thought a council worker had picked up the letter with her address on and assumed the rest of the dumped rubbish was also hers.Hounslow Council told Ms Alvarez she had until 5 November to make the payment in full, or she could face legal proceedings in which she could be criminally charged. She said: \"I don't have that money to give, I can't afford getting into debt to pay it, and I don't want to get a mark on my record. \"I'm a mental health nurse, I went to university for three years.\"They're fining me more than someone gets for speeding.\"The Local Democracy Reporting Service understands Hounslow Council put the fine on hold while it investigated.However, it has not been cancelled and the council has stayed firm on the envelope fine. In a statement, councillor Pritam Grewal, cabinet member for community safety, said the council \"remains committed to taking a zero-tolerance approach to littering and protecting the local environment\".He added: \"We have done the right thing in issuing the fine, because littering includes leaving waste anywhere in public apart from in a bin, regardless of whether bins are full. \"While we accept that no one likes receiving a fine, residents expect us to tackle the offence and the offenders.\"Related stories",

Get Me Out of Here! meaning individual contestants cannot be voted to do every bushtucker trial for numerous days in a row.Show bosses said the new rule, which will mean celebrities can do \"two in a row and you miss a go\", has been created to \"give all campmates the opportunity to shine\".Viewers voted for DJ Dean McCullough to do trials six times in a row in last year's series, while ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock also did six trials in a row in 2022.The gruesome trials often require celebrities to eat delicacies like kangaroo anus, crocodile penis and sheep semen, or be trapped with creatures such as snakes, cockroaches and rats.Being repeatedly nominated for trials has taken its toll on some celebrities in the past. Gillian McKeith appeared to faint after she was voted to do her seventh trial in 2010.ITVThis year's line-up of contestants will be seen entering the jungle on SundayITV said all celebrities want a chance to do trials, and viewers don't want to see the same person doing them day after day.A spokesperson said: \"Show bosses are keen to give all campmates the opportunity to shine in Bushtucker Trials this year and are bringing in a new rule that after a celebrity has been voted for TWO trials in a row, they cannot be voted for one on the next day.\"This new rule means the responsibility for winning food is shared amongst more of the campmates.\"More campmates will have an opportunity to step up and play their part with viewers getting a chance to get to know them more, it's their chance to shine.\"This year's series will start on Sunday, with TV personality Jack Osbourne, comedian Ruby Wax and model and presenter Kelly Brook among the celebrities who are heading to the Australian jungle.Other famous faces include former Lioness Alex Scott, Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley and Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp.Rapper Aitch, social media personality Morgan Burtwistle, who is known as Angryginge, EastEnders' actress Shona McCarty and comedian Eddie Kadi round out the list.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBBCIsrael has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in areas of Gaza that have remained under its control since the ceasefire with Hamas started on 10 October, satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show.The new photos - the latest of which was taken on 8 November - show that entire neighbourhoods controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been levelled in less than a month, apparently through demolitions.The actual number of destroyed buildings could be significantly higher, with satellite imagery for some areas being unavailable for BBC Verify's assessment.Some experts have argued that the demolitions may violate the terms of the ceasefire brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey. But an IDF spokesperson told BBC Verify that it was acting \"in accordance with the ceasefire framework\".US President Donald Trump's 20 point peace plan for Gaza - the basis for the ceasefire - stated \"all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended\". He has since repeatedly stated that \"the war is over\".BBC Verify's visual analysis of satellite imagery has found that the destruction of buildings in Gaza by the Israeli military has been continuing on a huge scale. We used a change detection algorithm to analyse radar images taken before and after the ceasefire to highlight changes, which might indicate destruction, then manually counted visibly destroyed buildings.We looked at buildings destroyed behind the Yellow Line - a boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza. Under October's ceasefire deal Israel agreed to withdraw its forces to that marker, annotated by a yellow line on maps released by the IDF.Houses, orchards and gardens flattenedMany of the razed buildings did not appear to be damaged prior to being destroyed, for example, in eastern Khan Younis, around Abasan al-Kabira.It's hard to be conclusive from a satellite image taken from above, but these buildings did not have visible damage to their structure or tell tale signs like nearby rubble or changes to their outlines. There were houses with gardens, trees and some small orchards.A comparison between satellite images of this area captured at the start of the war in October 2023 with images captured around the date of the ceasefire shows little change to many buildings.Lana Khalil used to live in Abasan al-Kabira before she was displaced to nearby al-Mawasi. She described her home as being a \"heaven\" and full of \"farms and vegetables\".Now, like so many other parts of Gaza, the area has been reduced to rubble.\"The Israeli military left nothing to us, they demolished everything,\" she said. Ms Khalil added that former residents could hear the demolition of the area \"from our tents in al-Mawasi\".\"Our hearts are broken,\" she said.In another area, near al-Bayuk, east of the city of Rafah, satellite imagery tells the same story. Numerous buildings that seemed from above to be undamaged before the ceasefire have since been destroyed. Aerial footage of a huge explosion published at the start of November shows dust rising from the ruins of the neighbourhood.Destruction has also continued in Gaza City itself, in the eastern neighbourhood of Shejaiya as well as near the Indonesian hospital on the edge of Jabalia camp.Eitan Shamir, ex-head of the National Security Doctrine Department in the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs, suggested that the IDF's actions were not a violation of the ceasefire terms, arguing that they don't apply to areas of the Strip behind the Yellow Line.Verified videos showing controlled demolitions and excavators tearing down buildings published to social media since the ceasefire have also been geolocated to areas behind the Yellow Line.Demolitions a 'violation of ceasefire'The IDF has defended its actions and a spokesperson said: \"According to the agreement, all terror infrastructure, including tunnels, is to be dismantled throughout Gaza. Israel is acting in response to threats, violations, and terror infrastructure.\"On 18 October, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that \"demilitarizing Gaza by destroying the terror tunnels and all terror infrastructure\" was a \"clear\" part of Israel's security policy.Point 13 of Trump's peace plan published by the White House - the closest thing to publicly released terms of the ceasefire - stated that all \"military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt\".But it also states the process of demilitarisation of Gaza will be \"under the supervision of independent monitors\".\"This is definitely a violation of the ceasefire,\" said Dr H A Hellyer, a RUSI Senior Associate Fellow. \"But [Washington] DC is unwilling to recognise it as such, insisting that the ceasefire has to hold, even when it isn't actually holding.\"But Mr Shamir denied the IDF was breaching the ceasefire. He told BBC Verify that according to his sources within the IDF there was a view that: \"Hamas is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls, and Israel is allowed to do what it wants in the territory it controls.\"The IDF was taking the view that it was unlikely Hamas would follow through with the second stage of the agreement, according to his sources.\"Therefore, the space must be prepared for the continuation of the fighting, so as not to leave [them] any options to ambush our soldiers.\" He also said that there were frequent attempts by Hamas to infiltrate beyond the Yellow Line and that there were still long sections of tunnel to be dealt with.Israel levelling thousands of Gaza civilian buildings in controlled demolitionsInside Gaza, BBC sees total devastation after two years of warCan the Gaza ceasefire deal survive?Some analysts - such as Adil Haque, professor of law at Rutgers University - said Israel could be violating the laws of war, which prohibit the destruction of civilian property by an occupying power.He noted that exceptions to the rule can only arise \"from military operations, that is, from combat or direct preparations for combat,\" arguing that during a ceasefire \"it is not plausible that such significant destruction of civilian property has been rendered absolutely necessary by military operations\".Hugh Lovatt, Senior Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said ultimately the demolitions could jeopardise the peace plan.\"The problem of Israeli demolitions will grow the longer Israel stays in the zone behind the Yellow Line.\"Ultimately, the sense that Israel is stalling its withdrawal and looking to create new permanent facts on the ground, as it has in the West Bank, will become an increasingly greater threat to the maintenance of the ceasefire.\"Additional reporting by Alex Murray.

    "body": "2 hours agoBea SwallowBristolGoogleSeven men are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court laterSeven men have been charged with more than 40 offences as part of an investigation into group-based child sexual exploitation.The men, aged 19-26, were arrested on Tuesday in a targeted police operation in Bristol and will appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court later.The charges relate to 11 victims, who were all teenagers at the time of the alleged offences, which reportedly occurred between 2022 and 2025. It follows an investigation which began in November 2023 after concerns were raised about the sexual exploitation of a teenage girl.Det Ch Insp Tom Herbert, the senior investigating officer, said this was a \"complex and sensitive investigation which has the protection of young girls from exploitation at its very heart\".\"Working with our partners, we've ensured the most appropriate safeguarding measures and support has been made available to each victim to protect them from harm.\"Officers have been working around the clock to identify potential offences and we've worked extremely closely with the Crown Prosecution Service to reach this highly significant stage,\" he added. Sexual exploitation charges Avon and Somerset Police has given the following details relating to the charges: Hussain Bashar, 19, who is British and lives in Southmead, Bristol, has been charged with one count of rape.Mohamed Arafe, 19, who is Syrian and lives in Speedwell, Bristol, has been charged with sexual assault, causing or inciting the sexual exploitation of a child, and five counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child. He also faces charges relating to the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.Sina Omari, 20, who is Iranian and lives in Fishponds, Bristol, is charged with two counts of rape, four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, making an indecent photograph of a child, and supplying Class A drug charges.Wadie Sharaf, 21, who is Syrian and lives in Redland, Bristol, is also accused of rape, attempted rape, sexual assault and sexual activity with a child.Mohammed Kurdi, 21, who is British and lives in Henbury, Bristol, has been charged with two counts of rape, two counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, supplying ecstasy and cannabis.A 19-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with four counts of rape, arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child, distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and being concerned in the supply of ecstasy and cannabis.And a 26-year-old man, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.'Huge shock'Spt Deepak Kenth, from Avon and Somerset Police, said neighbourhood officers have been supporting the investigation since these offences were first identified.\"We know this update will be a huge shock to our communities and I want to reassure everyone that we'll continue to work tirelessly to protect children from abuse and exploitation,\" he said.\"Working with our partner agencies, we've held events in Bristol city centre and continue to work with hotels, taxi drivers, and other businesses, to raise awareness about the signs of exploitation and the need to report any concerns or issues to the police.\"Dep Ch James Bolton-Smith, lead of the organised child sexual abuse unit at the CPS, said they worked hard to establish that there was sufficient evidence for the charges and that it was in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings.\"We remind all concerned that proceedings against the suspects are active and they have a right to a fair trial.\"It is vital that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in anyway prejudice these proceedings,\" he said.Police and Crime Commissioner Clare Moody said a dedicated appeal page has been set up for the public to submit any information relating to the case. \"My thoughts are with the victims of these very serious crimes,\" she added. \"Their courage in coming forward must be met with sensitivity and specialist support.\"Related Internet Links ",

    "body": "10 hours agoGeorgina Rannard,Climate reporter, Belém, Brazil and Tabby WilsonWatch: Protesters clash with security at COP30 venue in BrazilProtesters carrying signs reading \"our forests are not for sale\" broke through security lines of the COP30 climate talks on Tuesday night in Belém, Brazil.BBC journalists saw United Nations security staff running behind a line of Brazilian soldiers shouting at delegates to immediately leave the venue.The UN told BBC News that the incident caused minor injuries to two security staff, in addition to limited damage to the venue.Social media videos showed protesters that appeared to be from indigenous groups and others waving flags with the logo of a left-wing Brazilian youth movement called Juntos.Protesters, some wearing what appeared to be traditional indigenous dress, stormed the COP30 entrance, chanting and kicking down doors, before tussling with security personnel, videos posted online showed. Demonstrators crossed the first security barriers of the venue and were then prevented from getting further in, the UN told the BBC. A security guard said he was hit in the head by a drum thrown by a protester, according to the Reuters news agency.It is a highly unusual security breach at a conference that has strict protocols.Brazilian and UN authorities are investigating the incident, according to the UN.ReutersDelegates from almost 200 countries are attending COP30 talks, which officially runs from Monday 10 November to Friday 21 November.This year's gathering takes place ten years after the Paris climate agreement, in which countries pledged to try to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C.It is the first time the conference is being held in Brazil, with the talks taking place in Belém on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. The location has proved a controversial decision for a number of reasons, in part due to the Amazon's residents, many of whom are vocal critics of the environmental damage caused to their home by climate change and deforestation.Brazil has also continued to grant new licences for oil and gas which, alongside coal, are fossil fuels, the main cause of global warming.An indigenous leader from the Tupinamba community told Reuters, \"we can't eat money,\" and that they were upset about development in the rainforest.\"We want our lands free from agribusiness, oil exploration, illegal miners and illegal loggers,\" he said.The meetings this year have been dubbed \"the Indigenous peoples COP\", with Brazilian organisers promising to put indigenous people at the centre of the talks.  Brazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples Sonia Guajajara hailed COP30 as \"historic\" event, and estimated that 3,000 Indigenous peoples from around the world would be in attendance.A UN report released earlier this year said that Indigenous people safeguard 80% of the planet's remaining biodiversity – yet receive less than one per cent of international climate funding.Indigenous peoples are disproportionately impacted by climate change due to their dependence on the natural environment and its resources.Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening of the summit that the world must \"defeat\" climate denialism and fight fake news.He said that the decision to hold COP30 in Belém was designed to show that the Amazon is an essential part of the climate solution, adding that \"COP30 will be the COP of truth\" in an era of \"misrepresentation\" and \"rejection of scientific evidence\".According to the president, the \"most diverse biome on Earth\" is home to nearly 50 million people, including 400 Indigenous groups.

    "body": "Thousands of NHS staff in England to lose jobs after deal approved3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentPA MediaThousands of NHS staff redundancies in England will now go ahead after a deal was reached with the Treasury to allow the health service to overspend this year to cover the cost of pay-offs.The government said earlier this year 18,000 admin and managerial jobs would go with NHS England, the body that runs the NHS, being brought into the Department of Health and Social Care alongside cuts to local health boards.NHS bosses and health ministers had been in talks with the Treasury over how to pay for the £1bn one-off bill with the health service wanting extra money.The Treasury blocked that, but the BBC understands a compromise has been reached with the NHS permitted to overspend this year. 'Pragmatic step'As the job cuts result in savings in future years, the NHS will be expected to recoup the costs further down the line.Overall, government sources said no extra money is going into the NHS beyond what was agreed at the spending review this year – an extra £29bn a year above inflation by 2028-29.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast that patients and NHS staff had told him the health service had \"too many layers of management, too many layers of bureaucracy\".\"People want to see the front line prioritised, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" he said, adding he would tell NHS leaders \"we're finally on the road to recovery\" in his speech later on Wednesday.In a speech to health managers at the NHS Providers' conference in Manchester later, Streeting is expected to say: \"I want to reassure taxpayers that every penny they are being asked to pay will be spent wisely.\"We're now pushing down on the accelerator and slashing unnecessary bureaucracy, to reinvest the savings in front-line care.\"It won't happen overnight, but with our investment and modernisation, we will rebuild our NHS so it is there for you when you need it once again.\"According to the government, the reforms will raise £1bn a year by the end of the parliament to improve services for patients.It said every £1bn saved in bureaucracy costs is enough to fund an extra 116,000 hip and knee operations.NHS England is expected to be brought back into the Department of Health within two years, while the cuts to integrated care boards (ICBs), which plan health services for individual regions, will reduce their headcounts by 50%.NHS Providers' chief executive Daniel Elkeles said: \"This is a pragmatic step that means planned redundancies can now go ahead.\"It reflects the flexibility of a three-year settlement, allowing some funding to be brought forward in order to generate future savings to go into front-line care.\"However, we must recognise the position of staff affected by these changes - people who have offered commitment and service to the NHS - who face a very uncertain future.\"But Patricia Marquis of the Royal College of Nursing warned the redundancies could backfire.\"Front-line services need more investment, but to do this off the backs of making thousands of experts redundant is a false economy. \"Expert registered nurses working across NHS England and ICBs don't just run vital public health programmes and oversee care programmes for the vulnerable – they connect the NHS and social care services with one another. \"To imply these are administrators shows a complete lack of understanding of their roles and how they contribute to patient care.\"Why is NHS England being abolished?NHS England - the body that runs the NHS in England - was created as part of the 2012 reforms introduced under former Tory health secretary Andrew Lansley.The idea was to free the health service from political meddling – with ministers instead setting the wider strategy, but stepping back from getting involved on a daily basis.But Lansley's successor as health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said recently NHS England had ended up a \"bureaucratic monster\" that stifles innovation with reports some organisations were at times filling out 250 forms a month just to satisfy both NHS England and the health department.And on the front line, one of the most common complaints is that NHS England was incredibly controlling, even requesting individual NHS trusts ask for permission for something as mundane as granting media interviews.But make no mistake, this is also about control. Ministers have argued it is only right that a democratically-elected government was in charge of day-to-day running of the health service.But given Labour, in opposition, was critical of the Tories messing around with NHS structures, embarking on its own reorganisation comes with significant risk.Those working in the health service already talk about the disruption and distraction these changes are causing - and given NHS England oversees the day-to-day running of the health service, organises some specialist services and has a role in training and digital innovation, it is not difficult to see why there are some serious concerns about the reforms.Streeting told BBC Breakfast that patients and NHS staff had told him the health service had \"too many layers of management, too many layers of bureaucracy\".\"People want to see the front line prioritised, and that is exactly what we're doing,\" he said, adding he would tell NHS leaders \"we're finally on the road to recovery\" in his speech later on Wednesday.",

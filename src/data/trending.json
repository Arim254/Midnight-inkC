Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "6 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTiphaine Auzière is one of Brigitte Macron's three childrenBrigitte Macron's daughter has told a court in Paris that sexist cyber-bullying negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.Tiphaine Auzière, 41, is the step-daughter of French President Emmanuel Macron. She took the stand on the second and final day of the trial of 10 people accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality.Mrs Macron, 72, has long been the target of conspiracy theories which allege she is a transgender woman.\"It is important to be here today to express the harm my mother has faced. I wanted to give an account of what her life has been like since the moment she started being targeted by these attacks,\" Ms Auzière said. She added she had noticed a change and a \"deterioration\" in her mother's health since claims around her gender and sexuality began swirling. Mrs Macron \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... She knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories,\" Ms Auzière said. She said that not a day went by that the claims were not somehow reported to her mother - \"even by someone who means well and feels for her\". While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Ms Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.\"She hasn't been elected, she hasn't asked anything of anyone, and she comes under attack.\"Prosecutors are seeking suspended prison terms of three months to 12 months for the accused, and fines of up to €8,000 ($9,300). Getty ImagesBrigitte and Emmanuel Macron married in 2007, when he was 29 and she was 54Among the defendants - all aged 41 to 65 - are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher.One - a man named Aurélien Poirson-Atlan - is accused of telling his 200,000 online followers that Mrs Macron is a transgender woman and that the 24-year age gap between her and Emmanuel Macron amounts to \"state-sanctioned paedophilia\".Mr Poirson-Atlan told the court on Tuesday that he was a \"satirist\" who had just wished to put forward \"a point of view different to that of the mainstream media\". Two other defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were already found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother had changed gender and started using her name. They were later acquitted by a court of appeals.Other defendants also said they had employed their \"freedom of expression\". One requested the Macrons publish photos of Brigitte Macron pregnant to prove she is a biological woman. The Macrons have already said they will present such evidence in court proceedings against US right-wing influencer Candace Owens. Owens has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man and in March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.Earlier this year the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, told the BBC the couple would present photographic and scientific evidence to a US court to prove Mrs Macron is a woman.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "Australian authorities are investigating after an 80-year-old woman who was left behind on a Great Barrier Reef island by a cruise ship was found dead.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250 km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found the woman's body on Sunday morning.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it is investigating and will meet the ship's crew when it docks in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for AMSA said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time on Saturday (05:00 GMT on Friday) by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff have contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Fifield said.The elderly Australian woman is understood to have joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 local time with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told the ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"Ayris said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"It is understood the woman was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Queensland police said a report will be prepared for the coroner in the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman.

    "body": "52 minutes agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterThe chancellor has vowed to \"defy\" gloomy forecasts for the UK economy after it emerged the government is facing a bigger-than-expected hole in the public finances.The BBC understands the official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), is set to downgrade the UK's productivity performance - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked.The change to the key measure could lead to the chancellor facing a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules, adding to expectations taxes will be hiked at the Budget next month.Rachel Reeves said she would not \"pre-empt\" any downgrade by the OBR, but was \"determined that we don't simply accept the forecasts but we defy them\".The chancellor addressed the emergence of a the UK's productivity being downgraded for the first time when writing in the Guardian newspaper on Tuesday.\"Those conclusions [by the OBR] will be delivered at the budget next month and I am not going to pre-empt them. But I am going to be candid now that the productivity performance we inherited from the previous Conservative government and since the financial crisis has been too weak,\" Reeves said.Ahead of the Autumn Budget in November, speculation is growing what choices Reeves will make on tax and public spending.She is widely expected to increase taxes following a gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on cuts to welfare spending, which have made it more difficult for her to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.After announcing tax rises of £40bn in her previous Budget last year, which included a hike in the amount employers are required to pay in National Insurance Contributions, Reeves said she was \"not coming back\" for more tax rises.But economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have calculated a shortfall of £22bn in the public finances and suggested Reeves will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes.A downgrade to the UK's productivity performance could see that figure grow higher.Reeves in recent days has opted to go on the offensive against the expected negative forecasts and has sought to pin the current economic situation in the previous Conservative government along with Brexit and the Covid pandemic.\"Austerity, a chaotic Brexit and the pandemic have left deep scars on the British economy that are still being felt today,\" she wrote.\"If productivity is our challenge, then investment is our solution,\" she added, listing pledges to invest in the NHS, roads, rails, energy and defence in order to \"get Britain building\".Reeves said there could be \"no return to austerity\". If she opts not to cut public spending or borrow more money, then tax rises are the likely option in order for her to remain within her fiscal rules, which are designed to maintain credibility with the global financial markets the UK borrows money from.The government has made growing the economy its main goal in an effort to improve living standards, but growth has remained sluggish since it won power.Some have blamed Reeves's tax rises in the previous Budget, such as the increase in National Insurance for employers, for putting off business investment and job creation.Many household budgets also remain under pressure with the cost of food and energy rising. This week, the UK's main surpermarkets warned warned food prices could rise even further if higher taxes were to be imposed on the sector.The OBR is understood to have downgraded forecast for productivity by 0.3 percentage points.The IFS has calculated that for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add as much a £21bn to the Budget hole.However, there are several other moving parts in the Budget which may soften the blow for the chancellor, such as the decline in the interest rates paid on government debt.Reeves said she accepted that \"our country and our economy continue to face challenges\".\"I don't need a spreadsheet to tell me that too many working people in Britain feel the economy is unfair and does not work for them, with the cost of living still bearing down on family budgets,\" she added.\"These decisions - and the decisions I will take at the Budget - don't come for free and they are not easy, but they are the right, fair and necessary choices.\"",

    "body": "44 minutes agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesHurricane Melissa is causing havoc in Jamaica as the Caribbean nation faces the strongest storm in its modern history.The hurricane, fell from a category four storm to category 3 with wind speeds of 125mph (201km/h) on Tuesday evening, as it headed towards Cuba and then the Bahamas. Earlier, Melissa made landfall on Jamaica's coastline with winds of more than 185mph.A Meteorological Service of Jamaica official had warned conditions would get \"significantly worse\" and the US National Hurricane Center predicted \"catastrophic winds, flash flooding and storm surges\". Jamaican authorities urged residents and visitors to continue sheltering, as nearly a third of the country last power.Photos emerging from Jamaica since Hurricane Melissa made landfall show fallen trees and damaged homes.\"It's a catastrophic situation,\" the World Meteorological Organization's tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said at a press briefing, warning of storm surges up to four metres high.\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century, for sure.\"Roofs have been torn off hospitals, former Jamaican senator Imani Duncan-Price told the BBC.\"People are trying to rescue people in the middle of the storm just to save lives.\"Up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain is expected in some parts, with areas already experiencing flash flooding. Around 70% of the island's 2.8 million population lives within 5km of the sea.AFP via Getty ImagesWildlife is also a threat. Flooding may displace crocodiles from their natural dwellings, Jamaican health officials said.\"Rising water levels in rivers, gullies, and swamps could cause crocodiles to move into residential areas,\" the South East Regional Health Authority said in a statement.\"Residents living near these areas are therefore advised to remain vigilant and avoid flood waters.\"Winston Warren, who said he lives less than 1km from the ocean, described \"a constant roar of water\".\"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house?\" he said. \"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\"One woman told the BBC: \"There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\"EPAThe slow-moving storm is expected to remain powerful as it crosses Jamaica, whose highland communities are vulnerable to landslides and flooding.Even before the eye of the hurricane reached land, the region experienced extreme weather and fatalities. On Monday, Jamaica's government said three people had died in \"storm-related\" incidents, involving falling trees.The storm is heading towards Santiago de Cuba, Cuba's second-largest city.In Cuba, authorities said they evacuated about 500,000 people from areas vulnerable to winds and flooding.\"Melissa will arrive with force, and there's great concern about what it could destroy in its wake,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a message published in state newspaper Granma.Additional reporting by Brandon Drenon and Gabriela Pomeroy",

    "body": "26 minutes agoJessica Rawnsley and Gabriela PomeroyGetty ImagesResidents and holidaymakers have described their terror as Hurricane Melissa made landfall in south-western Jamaica, the strongest storm to hit the Caribbean nation in modern history.Locals and tourists told the BBC how they hunkered down as the storm ripped roofs off buildings and cut power to about a third of the country's 2.8 million population.\"The doors are being blown off by the wind,\" said Kabien, a mother-of-three who runs a beauty salon in the town of Santa Cruz.With panic in her voice, she said: \"I am trying to use my own manpower to stop the wind blowing in the door.\"Follow live: Hurricane Melissa hits Jamaica with violent winds as authorities warn of 'catastrophic' floodingWhy Hurricane Melissa is so dangerousWatch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfall\"There is water coming through the roof of the house,\" she said. \"I am not OK.\"Her three young children were \"very, very scared\", she added.Melissa made landfall on Tuesday afternoon in south-western Jamaica near the town of New Hope with wind speeds of 185 mph (295 km/h), according to the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).Originally a category five storm, it was downgraded to category three after it made landfall and began sweeping across the island. Up to 30in (76cm) of rain was expected in some parts of Jamaica.Officials said it would continue to decrease in intensity, but remain extremely dangerous, as it moves towards Cuba and then the Bahamas.Kyle Holmes, from Bolton, who is visiting Jamaica with his wife and young daughters, aged 7, 10, and 12, for a family wedding, told the BBC of the devastation wreaked by the storm.He said the hotel he was staying in - the Grand Palladium Resort, in the town of Lucea, half an hour from Montego Bay on the coast - looks like \"a disaster zone\".He said he barricaded the windows to the hotel room by placing all the furniture against them, and his family were safe after the \"worst experience ever\".Getty ImagesA man installs storm shutters in Portmore; preparations for Hurricane Melissa have been ongoing for days across JamaicaWinston Warren, who has been riding out the hurricane from inside his home in east Kingston, less than a kilometre from the ocean, told the BBC: \"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house.\"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\"Emma, who is on a family holiday in Jamaica from Essex, England, said the windows of their Montego Bay hotel had been smashed by high winds.\"We moved to a safe room as the children were petrified,\" she said. \"The windows have been blown through and the staff are working furiously to make us safe.\"We have all just moved to another room in the building as the glass in the lobby is unsafe. We are all terrified.\"Damion, a computer scientist living in Kingston, told the BBC he had woken on Tuesday to winds \"so strong you would not be able to stand up\" outside.Simon Johnson, 33, who lives in Harbour View in Kingston with his wife and two sisters, said the family had experienced hurricanes before - \"but not one of this size\".Living just 200m (650ft) from the harbour, he told the BBC he was \"feeling anxious\".They have stockpiled a week's worth of food, he added, but many of the supermarkets were empty and he could not find any bread in the neighbourhood.Getty Images'The birds have all gone'Officials warned people as the storm arrived to cover themselves with a mattress, move to an indoor room, and to wear a helmet if possible.Jamaican health officials also warned that flooding may displace crocodiles from their natural dwellings.Melissa is the strongest storm on record for the island nation - and the strongest globally this year.The NHC warned of \"catastrophic and life-threatening\" conditions once it landed in Jamaica, with torrential rainfall, deadly flash flooding and landslides.Three \"storm-related deaths\" on the Caribbean island have already been attributed to the storm, as well as four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.Tourists in Jamaica described being \"stuck in limbo\" with the country's two international airports closed, flights cancelled and limited information from airlines.Rebecca Chapman, who travelled to Jamaica for her 25th wedding anniversary, said she had arrived on Thursday evening just as storm preparations began.She was staying in Lucea with her husband and their three teenage sons.\"The birds have all gone so it's all gone really quiet. It's like a ghost town,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the storm hit on Tuesday.The Foreign Office has advised Britons in Jamaica to follow local authority advice, \"especially in the event of any evacuation orders\".",

A second man, 45, was hospitalised with life-changing injuries and a boy, 14, sustained non life-threatening or changing stab wounds, police said.An Afghan national, 22, was Tasered and arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder at Midhurst Gardens, Uxbridge, at 17:00 GMT on Monday.The Home Office confirmed the arrested man entered the UK in a lorry in November 2020, was granted asylum and leave to remain in 2022, and does not live in Home Office accommodation. He was taken to hospital as a precaution but has since been taken into police custody, the Met said.The attack is not being treated as terrorism, and detectives are working to establish any relationship between the suspect and the three victims, the Metropolitan Police said.PA MediaCandles were lit and flowers were placed at the edge of the police cordonOn Tuesday evening, about 100 people held a minute's silence by the cordon surrounding the scene.They applauded at the end and the group started to disperse shortly after.A large group of men, women and children laid flowers at the junction between Midhurst Gardens and Leybourne Road, and some lit candles.PA MediaOne person was fatally stabbed and two were injured, the Met saidFootage posted online appeared to show the suspect walking along a residential street, before two police officers sprinted after him, one pointed a Taser and shouted \"drop the knife\" and \"get on the floor\".Several others joined them before the Taser was fired and the man fell to the ground.Ch Supt Jill Horsfall said: \"This was a shocking and senseless act of violence that has left one man dead and two others injured.\"Our thoughts are with the victim's family and friends at this unimaginably difficult time.\"George Tryfonidis/BBCA man is in police custody following the triple stabbingShe added: \"The incident will have understandably caused concern to the local community. \"I have deployed multiple officers to the local area, they will be here throughout the week to provide reassurance while detectives work intensely to piece together the circumstances.\"I understand that there has been a lot of speculation online following on from this incident. We ask that you rely on us for information, and that you do not share sensitive footage.\"The family of the deceased man have been told and are being supported by specially-trained officers, the Met said.PA MediaFlowers were left at the edge of the police cordonOn Tuesday, a neighbour in Uxbridge said the man who died was a bin man, and described him as \"the last person on Earth that you would think somebody would go for\".\"He's a bin man. I've been here two years and would see him walk past the window,\" she said.She added that on Monday he was \"just doing the normal dog walk he does every day.\"I still can't get over it. If he was five or 10 minutes later taking the dog out would the same thing have happened?\"She said she took some flowers and a box of shortbread over for his wife.\"Everybody's scared\", says Uxbridge resident after triple stabbingFour bunches of flowers were left near the police cordon, one of which was placed by a female neighbour from a nearby road who did not wish to be named.She said: \"Last night the police came down my road... I thought to myself 'oh my God I wonder what's happened'.She said she found out what happened early on Tuesday which made her feel \"absolutely sick\".She added: \"The area used to be lovely, over the years it's really gone downhill.\"I just thought I'd come down and put some flowers down for the family.\"'Horrendous'Another woman, who did not want to share her name, told BBC News: \"The man that was stabbing random people chased after two of my son's friends but they managed to escape.\"It's horrendous and just on our doorstep. It's frightening - my daughter couldn't sleep last night because she thought the man was going to come and attack her.\"Robin Stevens, 50, who lives on the other side of Midhurst Gardens, said he heard a lot of sirens on Monday evening and he found out what happened on Tuesday morning.He said he was \"shocked\", adding: \"I grew up on this street, I've lived on this street for 50 years and I've always known it to be quite a family orientated area.\"Wisam Salah, 18, who lives near the cordon, said \"everyone is really panicked\" after the incident.A Home Office spokesperson offered sympathies to those impacted by the \"horrific incident\" and are being updated by the Met as the investigation continues.\"The priority must now be for the police to investigate so those responsible can be brought to justice,\" they added.Anyone who saw or has information about the incident are asked to contact police.Related internet links",

He denied he had breached the Met's standards of professional behaviour, but the hearing found the case against him proven.Robinson denied the two allegations of gross misconduct but accepted he had made the comments which appeared in the Panorama film.He said: \"I was not trivialising the allegation, and I was not mocking the victim.\"Robinson told the hearing he had been concerned one of the suspects in the case may have been wrongfully detained due to \"inadequacies in the case\" during the arrest.He said he had been questioning the officer in the case \"to make sure there are grounds to keep this person in custody\".He argued the footage aired was only an edited snapshot of the conversation he was having about the case and issues over the suspect's detention.The misconduct hearing was played unedited footage from Panorama which showed him talking to the arresting officer about the victim in the case.The arrested officer told Robinson about a rape allegation where a woman said she had woken up without trousers on and did not remember taking them off.Robinson is heard saying: \"I've got to be honest, I've gone to bed before and can't remember taking my trousers off\".Later, in conversation with another officer, he was heard questioning the victim's allegation and her ability to identify her attacker.In the footage, Robinson said: \"I mean, one of them might be orange with green hair and obviously it's him.\"Another officer then asks, \"like an Oompa Loompa?\" and Robinson then says \"yeah\" before laughing and then singing an excerpt from the Oompa Loompa song from the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with the other officer.In his defence, Robinson was taken through CCTV from the custody suite and raw unedited footage recorded by the BBC undercover reporter.Referring to his comments in the footage, he said: \"There was a concern that something has gone a little bit wrong. There are inadequacies in the case.\"I'm certainly not mocking anybody. I'm trying to get to the bottom of what's gone on.\"He added: \"I'm not trying to deny a rape has taken place. I'm trying to confirm, I think a rape has taken place.\"He said his comments were out of \"frustration\" at the process and the arresting officers in the case, who he had believed had made mistakes.When asked about the comments referring to an Oompa Loompa and the singing, he said they were made in reference to another custody officer and making light of his height.Chair of the panel Commander Andy Brittain found both allegations against Robinson as proven.He said: \"The public cannot have confidence in PS Robinson to protect them and others. This behaviour is not compatible with the role of a police officer.\"In a statement following the hearing, Met Police professionalism Commander Simon Messinger said Robinson's behaviour was \"appalling.\" \"It is absolutely right he is dismissed and no longer part of our organisation,\" he added.Four other Met police officers were sacked last week for conduct revealed by the BBC Panorama programme.PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was dismissed on Friday after being secretly filmed \"boasting about and revelling in the use of force\" on a detainee.A day earlier, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg were dismissed after allegations of gross misconduct were upheld. McIlvenny was filmed being dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegation of rape and domestic violence against her partner and making misogynistic comments.Neilson was recorded referring to an \"invasion\" of \"scum\" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia. He was also observed saying a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have a \"bullet through his head\".Borg was filmed enthusiastically describing how he saw another officer stomp on a suspect's leg in custody.Another five officers are set to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings over footage from the Panorama investigation.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJack FenwickPolitical correspondentPA MediaWhere to house asylum seekers has become one of the fiercest topics of political debate since last year's general election.Ministers are considering housing 900 men in the Cameron Barracks in Inverness and Crowborough army training camp in East Sussex, as they seek to expand the use of military sites as an alternative to hotels. Small boat crossings have reached near-record levels and MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee said the Home Office had squandered billions of pounds of taxpayers' money on asylum accommodation.The estimated cost of the government's 10-year asylum accommodation contracts has more than tripled, from £4.5bn to £15.3bn.Ministers inside the Home Office believe that ultimately this issue can only be solved by increasing removals of failed asylum seekers and deterring people from arriving on small boats in the first place.But while they attempt to implement policies to achieve those aims, the Home Office still has to find somewhere for the tens of thousands of people seeking asylum to stay.ArrivalWhen people arrive in the UK by crossing the Channel on small boats, they are generally sent to a processing centre at Manston in Kent.The site is located on the former RAF Manston base and was opened by the Home Office in February 2022 as a response to the increasing number of arrivals.Migrants are supposed to be held there for 24 hours, while officials carry out security and identity checks, but overcrowding has sometimes led to people being forced to stay on the site for weeks.In late 2022, thousands of migrants were placed in tents at Manston, leading to overcrowding and disease, including diphtheria.A Home Office inquiry is currently taking place into the conditions at Manston.The department is also seeking planning approval to improve the site and use it for processing asylum seekers into the 2030s.Initial accommodationAfter leaving Manston, asylum seekers are then sent to initial accommodation provided by the Home Office, while officials decide whether they are eligible for further support.These are supposed to be centres managed by specialist migrant help staff, but many asylum seekers are instead sent to hotels or hostels straight away.There are 1,750 places available in initial accommodation and the latest government data showed 1,665 of those places were occupied in June.Most asylum seekers will then be sent to longer-term accommodation, where they will stay while their asylum claim is being processed.Flats and HMOsUnder the contracts signed by the Home Office, asylum seekers are supposed to be housed in so-called dispersal accommodation.These are self-catered properties within communities and are usually local flats or houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), a type of rented accommodation where at least three individuals share the use of a bathroom and kitchen.The average cost of housing an asylum seeker in dispersal accommodation is £23.25 a night, making it by far the cheapest option.In 2019, the government signed 10-year contracts with three companies – Serco, Mears and Clearsprings – and tasked them with finding properties that can be used for dispersal accommodation.But since the number of small boat crossings began to rise significantly in 2022, there's been a shortage of this type of accommodation.Finding more of these properties became a big priority for the former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and the latest government data shows that 66,234 people were in dispersal accommodation in June – around two-thirds of the total number of asylum seekers being housed.But the three companies tasked with finding these properties can make bigger profits from other types of accommodation – and the contracts drawn up by the Home Office don't include any penalties for the companies when they fail to hit their targets.Dispersal accommodation can impact local housing markets by effectively taking flats or HMOs out of general supply, something the Home Office acknowledges would cause frustrations within communities.Some concerns have been raised that protests targeting this type of accommodation could be difficult to police.HotelsHotels were only ever meant to be used as a stop-gap option when there was a temporary shortage of other accommodation.But increasing numbers of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats has meant hotels have become a regular, expensive and highly controversial feature of the UK's asylum accommodation system.They have led to soaring costs for the taxpayer and large profits for the three companies providing the accommodation.The average cost of housing an asylum seeker in a hotel is £144.98 a night, more than six times the price of dispersal accommodation.One of the reasons hotels are so much more expensive than other accommodation is because the asylum seekers being housed there are also given food.Under the contracts drawn up by the Home Office, providers are still paid even if the rooms are vacant.Asylum hotel use peaked under the Conservatives in September 2023 when 56,042 people were being housed.Latest government statistics show there were 32,059 asylum seekers being housed in hotels at the end of June – much lower than the peak, but 8% higher than when Labour came to power.The Home Office removed the need to consult local authorities about hotel use in 2020 and they've become lightning rods for protests.Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029, but achieving that target will be a tough ask.Large sitesBoth Conservative and Labour governments have experimented with using larger sites to house asylum seekers.Hundreds of asylum seekers could be placed in disused military sites, as part of efforts to achieve the prime minister's pledge to end hotel use.Ministers hope to move asylum seekers into sites in Inverness and East Sussex by the end of next month, with discussions between the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence ongoing about other potential locations.The Home Affairs Select Committee has said that large sites such as these will not enable the government to drive down costs of asylum accommodation.The idea is also likely to be highly controversial in the local communities where the sites are chosen, but the Home Office hopes that military sites could act as a deterrent to people thinking of crossing the Channel.Disused military land has in the past been earmarked for housebuilding, but plans to build on these sites have repeatedly gone awry.The government has indicated that other disused sites such as empty tower blocks, student accommodation and industrial sites could also be used to house asylum seekers.What happens next?The government's contracts with Serco, Mears and Clearsprings run until 2029, but have break clauses which the government could trigger in March next year.Home Office ministers wanted to trigger break clauses in the previous set of contracts, but the department hadn't left itself enough time to plan for an alternative accommodation system.The housing department has been working with local councils to explore what that alternative system could look like.But some within the Home Office do not believe that an alternative would be ready by March and as recently as May, it was understood that there was no plan to trigger the break clauses next year.The Home Office needs to save £1bn from the cost of asylum accommodation by 2029, otherwise it may have to find cuts in other areas of its budget.",

But is that where the similarities end?  \nWe talk to Tim Donovan, a former BBC reporter who covered London politics for decades. And we ask Mr Khan himself what it’s like to be a local politician with an international profile - especially when your most persistent critic, is a tenacious man called Donald Trump? \nProducers: Xandra Ellin, Valerio Esposito and Cat Farnsworth \nMix: Travis Evans  \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nImage: New York City mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, waves to his supporters after winning the 2025 New York City Mayoral race.

    "body": "A record number of referrals were made to the government's anti-terrorism scheme Prevent in the year to March 2025, according to new data.Referrals to Prevent, which can be made by schools, the police, local authorities or the public, rose by more than a quarter to 8,778.In the majority of cases, where a type of concern for the referral was noted, most specified \"no ideology identified\" or \"no ideology – other susceptibility to radicalisation identified\".A review into Prevent and the Southport murderer Axel Rudakubana found the scheme \"prematurely\" closed its case into him, due to there being no evidence that he had a fixed ideology or motivation.Rudakubana, who killed three girls and stabbed others at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in July last year, had been referred to Prevent three times between 2019 and 2021.The review found that counter-terrorism officers staffing the scheme had \"sufficient information\" to escalate Rudakubana's case to the next stage which would have included enhanced monitoring.At the time it was published, Security Minister Dan Jarvis said: \"The review concluded that too much focus was placed on the absence of a distinct ideology, to the detriment of considering the perpetrator's susceptibility, grievances and complex needs.\"The review led to the resignation of Michael Stewart, the head of Prevent, in March this year.Home Office data found that there had been an increase in referrals to Prevent around the time of Rudakubana's crime and his trial where he was found guilty and sentenced to 52 years in jail in January. Between 29 July last year, when the attack happened, and 31 March, the Home Office said referrals to Prevent rose by 34% to 6,350 compared to the same period the year before.In the release, the Home Office said that \"trends cannot be directly attributed to the Southport attack\".However, Lord David Anderson KC, who oversaw the review into Prevent, noted he had heard evidence from across the country of a \"large increase in referrals\" following the publicity of Rudakubana's case. He also cited the TV show Adolescence, released in March 2025, as a possible driver in referrals which, in total, rose by 27% to 8,778 from 6,922 the previous year.The latest data showed that children aged between 11 and 15 years old represented the largest proportion of referrals - 3,192 cases or 36% of the total - where the individual's age was known. Individuals aged 16 to 17 made up the second highest share of referrals, at 1,178 cases. Rudakubana was 17 at the time of his crime.There were also 345 referrals for children younger than 10.Outside of \"no ideology identified\" or \"no ideology – other susceptibility to radicalisation identified\" categories, the biggest concern noted in referrals was \"extreme right-wing\" ideology.There were 1,798 referrals citing \"extreme right-wing\" concerns, which the Home Office found was higher than those related to \"Islamist extremism\" which was noted in 870 referrals.For referrals where ethnicity was specified, the majority - 2,747 individuals - were recorded as white. Below that, 798 people who were referred were cited as Asian and 320 were recorded as black.Prevent, which forms a key part of the UK's counter-terror strategy, places a legal duty on public bodies to identify people who may turn to extremism.The Home Office figures are for England and Wales. Scotland reports its referral figures separately and, like England and Wales, saw the latest numbers reach a record high.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe UK is facing a long, drawn-out flu season, the boss of the NHS in England is warning.Sir Jim Mackey said there is \"no doubt\" this winter will be one of the toughest the health service has faced.It comes as flu rates have started climbing early this year, which is causing concern because the winter vaccination campaign has only just got under way and there are lots of vulnerable people yet to get protected.NHS England is issuing a \"flu jab SOS\", urging those eligible for the free vaccine to come forward quickly for it.More than 13 million people have been vaccinated so far this year, but that is still more than 5 million below the number who were jabbed last winter.Sir Jim said: \"There's no doubt this winter will be one of the toughest our staff have ever faced.\"Since stepping into this role, the thought of a long, drawn-out flu season has kept me awake at night. And, unfortunately, it looks like that fear is becoming reality.\"Australia has just endured its worst flu season on record — over 410,000 cases — and all the signs suggest the NHS will face similar challenges in the months ahead. From December through to March, our hospitals will be at capacity.\"How to get a flu shotPeople aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS. Appointments can be booked online, by phoning 119 or at local pharmacies and GPs.Children aged two to 16 can also get vaccinated with a nasal spray. That's mainly to help stop flu spreading.Other people can buy a flu vaccine from high street chemist shops and some supermarket pharmacies. Bad winter predictedTwo of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions were lifted combined with immunity being low.Last year, nearly 8,000 people died from flu, and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.Flu rates are currently three times higher than normal for this time of year, with the highest rates seen in children and young people. But health officials have warned the virus will start spreading to older groups in the coming weeks.Duncan Burton, chief nursing officer for England, said: \"With just weeks left to ensure best protection against the worst of the flu season, we are issuing an urgent SOS to the eligible people who have yet to get jabbed this year.\"It is vital that the public use the available appointments we have running next week to stamp out this early wave of flu cases and help shield themselves ahead of winter.\"The vaccine is proven to be safe and help prevent those at risk from getting seriously ill and even hospitalised from flu.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahon and Chris Vallance,Technology reportersGetty ImagesGrand Theft Auto (GTA) maker Rockstar Games has been accused by a trade union of sacking staff in the UK to stop them from unionising.The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents people working in the gaming sector, said 31 workers were fired from Rockstar's UK studios on 30 October.The union led rallies outside the company's offices in Edinburgh and London on Thursday to protest what it described as \"the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry\".The BBC has approached Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, for comment, which has reportedly claimed staff were sacked for sharing confidential information.\"Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,\" a Rockstar spokesperson told Bloomberg in a statement.\"This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities.\"At large video game studios, information about game development is tightly controlled - with employees often signing agreements not to share confidential information.Rockstar's upcoming GTA 6 is expected to be one of the best-selling games of all time, with fans clamouring for any news ahead of its May 2026 release date - meaning security around any information will be heightened at the studio.But union president Alex Marshall accused Rockstar of deflecting from the \"real reason\" for firing staff - which the IWGB believes is their union involvement.\"They are afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice,\" he said.\"Management are showing they don't care about delays to GTA VI, and that they're prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game.\"IWGBPickets have also taken place outside Take-Two Interactive's UK head office in London.According to the IWGB, the UK workers fired at the end of October were part of a group discussing forming a union at the company.Mr Marshall said its only non-Rockstar employees were union organisers.Speaking to the BBC at a picket outside the Rockstar North office in Edinburgh, organiser Fred Carter said he was standing alongside staff who had been sacked \"without warning\" and \"without reason\".\"They've been fired, we believe, because they're union members - which is a protected activity in the UK,\" he said.\"We're asking people to come out and support us, to demand their jobs back and demand accountability from Rockstar.\"After clips from Grand Theft Auto 6 were leaked online following a hack in 2022, Rockstar said it cost the firm $5m (£3.8m) and thousands of hours of staff time to recover.But Mr Marshall of the IWGB said the company's move to dismiss more than 30 UK workers showed it had \"chosen profits over both workers and fans of their games\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterThe BBC has upheld 20 impartiality complaints over the way presenter Martine Croxall altered a script she was reading live on the BBC News Channel, which referred to \"pregnant people\" earlier this year.Croxall was introducing an interview about research on groups most at risk during UK heatwaves, which quoted a release from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).The presenter changed her script to instead say \"women\", and the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) said it considered her facial expression as she said this to express a \"controversial view about trans people\".The presenter said: \"Malcolm Mistry, who was involved in the research, says that the aged, pregnant people … women … and those with pre-existing health conditions need to take precautions.\"The ECU said it considered Croxall's facial expression laid it open to the interpretation that it \"indicated a particular viewpoint in the controversies currently surrounding trans ideology.\" Following her introduction, Dr Mistry, an assistant professor at the LSHTM, spoke about the story, and referred to \"pregnant women.\"The ECU said Croxall's facial expression after she said \"pregnant people\" had been \"variously interpreted by complainants as showing disgust, ridicule, contempt or exasperation.\"It added that \"congratulatory messages Ms Croxall later received on social media, together with the critical views expressed in the complaints to the BBC and elsewhere, tended to confirm that the impression of her having expressed a personal view was widely shared across the spectrum of opinion on the issue\".Harry Potter author JK Rowling was among those who praised Croxall at the time.The ECU noted that \"Ms Croxall was reacting to scripting, which somewhat clumsily incorporated phrases from the press release accompanying the research, including 'the aged', which is not the BBC style, and 'pregnant people', which did not match what Dr Mistry said in the clip which followed\".It explained that \"giving the strong impression of expressing a personal view on a controversial matter, even if inadvertently, falls short of the BBC's expectations of its presenters and journalists in relation to impartiality, the ECU upheld the complaints\".The finding was reported to management of BBC News and discussed with Ms Croxall and the editorial team concerned.In 2022, the BBC said comments by Croxall made during a News Channel newspaper review, soon after Boris Johnson said he would not return to stand as Tory leader, breached its rules on impartiality.Her \"remarks and reactions... caused a significant risk the audience could believe opinions were being expressed on the Conservative leadership contest,\" the BBC said.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere is a buzz outside the Bank of England.City workers are taking advantage of the unusually mild weather to enjoy lunch outside, and there has been a shift in temperature too inside the Bank.The decision to hold rates at 4% was made by the narrowest of margins, and the interest rate panel thinks inflation has peaked.Governor Andrew Bailey said he wanted to see if forthcoming developments confirmed this view before cutting rates; weakness in the labour market could also play a part.The Bank also noted last year's Budget measures – such as an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions and minimum wages – contributed to price pressures over the last year.A key factor in future decisions will be the contents of the forthcoming Budget, which may ease price pressures with direct measures on bills, but also tax rises  taking money out of pockets.The chancellor has been keen to claim credit for creating the conditions for rate cuts by providing the right environment. But the Bank's report makes clear that last year's Budget measures have contributed to price pressures, and hiring hesitancy by adding to employer's costs.Ironically it is the impact on the labour market that may have contributed to views of the rate setters already looking to cut the cost of borrowing.While the Bank itself refused to speculate about the contents of this Budget, it noted signs that concerns elsewhere, among consumers and businesses, may be holding back the economy. With consumer spending remaining cautious, it expects the economy to grow by 1.2% in 2026, less than the 1.5% it predicts this year - that will not be welcomed in the Treasury.The interest rate panel will have plenty to evaluate in the Budget – the scale and shape of tax rises, help with energy bills and possibly other cost of living challenges, and increases in the National Living Wage.According to the Bank's research, labour costs remain a key uncertainty for employers and also for consumer prices.The rate setters will have to judge the impact of those policies – and the usual monthly evidence on inflation, jobs and so forth – by the next meeting in mid-December. By, in effect, holding the cast vote, it's the governor who may find himself deliberating whether to play Santa – or Scrooge.If not then, economists reckon a cut will come in February. And how many more to follow?The Bank says it sees rates continuing on a \"gradual downward path\". Some members remain nervous about lingering inflation pressures. Its research, for example, shows our expectations of inflation are shaped by recent experience, and in particular, the movements of food prices. We are still reeling from the exceptional pace  of price hikes in recent years and that can lead people and businesses to behave as if inflation is higher than it really is - through wage demands or price increases.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of homeowners will still face rising costs when renewing their mortgages as rates remain higher than a few years ago: they've been slower to come down than they were to go up.Borrowers may expect more gifts in 2026, but they may arrive only gradually.",

    "body": "King Charles III has officially stripped his brother Andrew Mountbatten Windsor of his HRH style and prince title. A new entry into Britain's official public record shows that the change has formally come into effect after it was announced last week.The King made the changes following weeks of intense scrutiny over the former prince's links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.   The record also confirmed his removal from the Roll of Peerage as the Duke of York, which had also been previously announced. The entry published in The Gazette, the UK's official public record, reads:\"The King has been pleased by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm dated 3 November 2025 to declare that Andrew Mountbatten Windsor shall no longer be entitled to hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of 'Royal Highness' and the titular dignity of 'Prince'.\"The Great Seal of the Realm refers to a wax seal, and is used by the Crown to show the monarch's approval of important State documents.Buckingham Palace said last week that Andrew would leave his Royal Lodge home in Windsor, as his links to Epstein continued to cause controversy.It was understood that he did not object to the King's decision to remove his titles.Andrew Mountbatten Windsor - as he is now to be known - gave up his other royal titles in October, including the Duke of York, after more questions and allegations about his private life.At the start of this year, emails showed that he had stayed in contact with Epstein for longer than he had previously admitted. In a posthumous memoir published last month, Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with  Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always strenuously denied the claims.",

    "body": "38 minutes agoLily Jamali,in San Francisco and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonNancy Pelosi has announced her retirement from Congress, ending a decades-long career that saw the California Democrat become one of the most powerful figures in US politics.In a video message on Thursday, Pelosi said she will not be seeking re-election to Congress at the end of her term in January 2027.It marks the end of a storied political career: Pelosi, 85, became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House and led her party in the lower chamber of Congress from 2003 until 2023.\"We have made history, we have made progress,\" Pelosi said in her message. \"We have always led the way, and now we must continue to do so by remaining full participants in our democracy, and fighting for the American ideals we hold dear.\"\"As we go forward, my message to the city I love is this: San Francisco, know your power,\" Pelosi added.Pelosi was first elected to Congress to represent San Francisco in 1987 aged 47, and quickly rose through the ranks. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House in 2007, becoming the first woman to serve in that role. She served until 2011, when Democrats lost control of the lower chamber, before returning to the speaker's chair from 2019 to 2023.Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line to the presidency.In that role, Pelosi played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents during her long career on Capitol Hill.She is widely credited with marshalling the passage of former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare legislation, as well as bills to address infrastructure and climate change during Joe Biden's presidency.Pelosi also directly challenged Donald Trump throughout his presidency, famously ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address behind his back.By then she was also a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform.She led two impeachment efforts against Trump - the first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine. Trump was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Biden, and of using military aid as leverage. He was later acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.The second was in 2021, when he was accused by the House of inciting the storming of the Capitol - the seat of the US Congress - with a speech on 6 January to supporters outside the White House. That effort ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted once again.Later, Pelosi worked with Biden to shepherd much of his legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins.In less than two years, Democrats in the House pushed through a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage.She was succeeded as Democratic leader in the House by New York Representative Hakeem Jeffries in 2022.Since leaving her speakership, she has remained a major political influence. Most recently, she played a key role in helping to pass Proposition 50 in California -  a state redistricting effort aimed at flipping five House seats to Democrats during the midterms in 2026.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondentThe stern appearance of Wandsworth prison is enough to make grown people shudder.Based in leafy south-west London, the Victorian-era facility - with its gaunt brick walls and a dark intimidating entrance - is one of the largest in the UK.  The inside is just as intimidating. Having visited several years ago, I was struck by the smell of urine from the gutters that line the cell blocks.  I've been inside several prisons during my career but this was by far the worst.Like many prisons, it suffers from overcrowding and has almost double the number of inmates it was designed to house.The prison is not known for having robust security. Only a couple of years ago, Daniel Khalife, who was on remand awaiting trial for breaching the Official Secrets Act, escaped by strapping himself to the underside of a food delivery truck.The mistaken release of two prisoners in a week has once again drawn attention to the Category B jail. One serving prison officer from the jail described the security as a \"joke\".  They told me: \"It's crazy in there and mistakes are constantly happening. There is a real state of panic after this blunder and I'm thinking about whether I can take much more of this job when stuff like this happens and makes us look like idiots.\"An independent monitoring board report released last month said a third of staff are absent every day - while a 2024 inspectorate report said security remained a significant concern with staff across most units unable to confirm where all their prisoners were during the working day.The prison is renowned for being one of the worst in the country. It received an urgent notification in May 2024 following an unannounced visit by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor.An \"urgent notification\" in prisons is a formal process where the chief inspector alerts the justice secretary about significant and urgent concerns. The urgent concerns included assaults on staff, overcrowding, and staff not being able to confirm where prisoners were.In a letter to the then Justice Secretary Alex Chalk, Mr Taylor wrote: \"Inspectors found significant weaknesses in many aspects of security. Wings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day.\"We know very little at this stage about why or how Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, a sex offender, was mistakenly released.The Metropolitan Police was not told about the error for almost a week and it is unclear why this was the case.As for a second man, William Smith, the BBC understands his accidental release was due to a clerical error at court. He has since handed himself in.I hear from insiders that it is a possibility prison staff did not realise Khaddour-Cherif was even missing until a few days after his release.Sources tell me that the governor of HMP Wandsworth, Andy Davy, was not at the jail on the day Khaddour-Cherif was mistakenly freed. Ironically, that is because Davy had been tasked with carrying out the inquiry into how Hadush Kebatu was released by accident from Chelmsford prison in Essex. I understand that investigation is now complete.Almost two weeks ago, the Justice Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister, David Lammy, introduced additional checks after the accidental release of Kebatu to ensure mistakes like that do not happen again.  But these checks are proving to be a \"significant burden\" according to one senior prison staffer, who said \"they've only increased the paperwork\".  \"It's now taking a day in some cases to complete the checks to release someone and this isn't helpful when staffing is an issue,\" they said.I understand the early release scheme that was brought in last summer after prisons almost reached full capacity has also increased pressure on staff - and contributed to the increase in accidental releases.The emergency scheme allows some inmates to be released after serving 40% of their fixed term sentence, rather than the usual 50%.\"There are more comings and goings now, and that means we're dealing with more checks, more paperwork, more calculations of sentences, and this just means more mistakes are happening. It's inevitable,\" a prison officer said.More than 200 people were released by mistake over the last year - and the government says it is unacceptable. Some staff are incandescent, saying the prison system has been in crisis for a while now, but that the recent errors are why politicians are suddenly engaging.\"How bad does it have to get before they do something?,\" asked one staffer.  \"It's a shitstorm.\"",

Your behaviour was short-lived and had little to no impact on the police investigation.\"'My best friend'Mrs Marriott, speaking through tears, told the court that her husband's death had affected every aspect of the family's life.She described her husband as reliable, trustworthy, affectionate and gentle, as someone who had a compassionate heart and loved helping others.\"Chris wasn't loud or in your face, but he was a great example of how small things done well and with love can have a big impact,\" she said.\"He was my best friend.\"Mrs Marriott said her husband loved being a father, and that their time together as a family of four had been far shorter than they had imagined.Family handoutChris Marriott was killed when he stepped in to help a collapsed womanShe said their children missed their father's \"kisses, big hugs and dad jokes,\" adding that there would be \"many big and small moments in their lives\" when they will wish their father was still here.\"His death has had a profound affect on our sons, who now feel scared about what might happen to me,\" she said.\"Chris's death will affect me and our children for the rest of our lives but instead of becoming full of hate, we choose to hold on to love.\"Ms Norris, who is still recovering from her injuries, said in a statement following the sentencing that she believed the best way to honour Mr Marriott's memory was to \"take responsibility for how we treat one another\".She urged people to \"resist hurting others when we are hurting ourselves\" and \"to keep looking out for one another with kindness and generosity\".Det Ch Insp Andy Knowles from South Yorkshire Police said: \"While I'm acutely aware that prison sentences for Hassan and Mohammed Jhangur will in no way bring a resolution for Chris's loved ones and the other injured victims, I hope it goes some way to helping them move on with their lives.\"More on this story",

The country, which has already been battling record rains and floods, is now facing one of Asia's strongest typhoons this year.The country's environment ministry said on Thursday that \"the storm is on land, in the provinces of Dak Lak and Gia Lai\" in a statement quoted by various outlets, including the AFP news agency.The Vietnamese national weather forecaster says hundreds of localities in seven cities and provinces are at risk of flooding and landslides in the next six hours. There have already been reports of damage from several provinces, including roofs torn off homes, shattered glass panels at hotels, and trees uprooted or snapped along city streets and rural roads by powerful gusts.In the Quy Non area, trees have fallen on main roads and windows in hotels have smashed.The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam at 19:29 local time (12:29 GMT). About 30 minutes later, hundreds of residents in two communes of Dak Lak province called for help, local media reported.Many people reported that their homes had collapsed or been flooded, while strong winds and heavy rain continued to batter the area.Dak Lak province is approximately 350km (215 miles) north-east of Ho Chi Minh City.The typhoon could generate waves of up to 8m (26ft) on the South China Sea, according to Vietnam's weather bureau. Vietnam's military has deployed more than 260,000 soldiers and personnel, along with more than 6,700 vehicles and pieces of equipment, including six aircraft, to help with storm relief efforts.On Wednesday morning, a reporter from AFP news agency saw officials knocking on the doors of homes in coastal communities and warning people to evacuate.According to local media reports, Prime Minister of Vietnam Pham Minh Chinh held an online meeting to direct the emergency response.\"We must reach isolated areas and ensure people have food, drinking water, and essential supplies,\" he was quoted as saying.\"No one should be left hungry or cold.\" AFP via Getty ImagesThe clean up begins at a hotel in VietnamBefore making landfall in Vietnam, the typhoon, known locally as Tino, left a trail of devastation in the Philippines.At least 114 people were killed and tens of thousands were evacuated, particularly from central areas including the populous island and tourist hotspot of Cebu, where cars were swept through the streets. Kalmaegi dumped the equivalent of a month of rain on the island in just 24 hours, sending torrents of mud and debris down mountainsides and into urban areas. Stunned survivors who had made it to higher ground watched as buses and shipping containers were tossed about in the raging floodwaters. The storm has wiped out entire neighbourhoods in poorer districts, where building materials are flimsier.Mely Saberon looked on in despair at the pile of debris that had once been her home in Talisay City, which suffered some of the worst destruction.\"We don't have any home anymore,\" she said. \"We weren't able to salvage anything from our house. \"We didn't expect the surge of rain and wind. We've experienced many typhoons before, but this one was different.\"Residents have now started the backbreaking task of cleaning away the thick layer of mud, and picking through the wreckage for anything that can be used. Early on Thursday, Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr declared a state of emergency, the threshold of which involves mass casualty, major damage to property, and disruption to means of livelihoods and the normal way of life for people in the affected areas.ReutersHomes were destroyed in floods caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi in Talisay, Cebu, Philippines, on 5 November Vietnam has already been battling with floods and record rains for the past week.Burst riverbanks have flooded some of the country's most popular tourist spots, including the Unesco-listed city of Hue and historic hotspot Hoi An, where residents have been pictured navigating the city in wooden boats after the Hoai river overflowed.Seaside communities in Vietnam are expected to be hit hard by Typhoon Kalmaegi. A sea-level rise of 4 to 6m (13 to 20ft) in at least two provinces could capsize boats and devastate fishing farms, according to a forecast issued at 16:00 local time (9:00 GMT) by a senior official at Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.Meanwhile, deputy director Nguyen Xuan Hien says Typhoon Damrey - which struck Vietnam in 2017 with less intensity than Kalmaegi, but still caused severe damage to coastal communities - should serve as a warning and urged people to remain highly alert.Thailand is also bracing for the storm's impact. Local officials have warned of flash floods, landslides and river overflows.EPAWaves crashed on the beach in Cua Dai, Da Nang, central Vietnam, on Thursday",

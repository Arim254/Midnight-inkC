    "body": "1 hour agoVikas Pandey,GoaandHarry SekulichA fire at a popular nightclub in India's coastal region of Goa has killed 25 people, local officials say. Most of the victims are believed to be staff at the Birch by Romeo Lane nightclub, located near a popular beach. Tourists are also said to be among the dead.Police believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venue on Saturday at midnight local time.The nightclub's manager has been arrested and an arrest warrant for the owner has been issued.Goa is a former Portuguese colony on the Arabian Sea. Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One eyewitness said that it was a usual Saturday night and holidaymakers were enjoying themselves.He said: \"I was outside the club when I heard screams, I didn't initially understand what was going on. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\"The venue was packed because it was hosting a Bollywood specialist DJ. Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing on the small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.\"The fire was mainly concentrated around the kitchen area on the ground floor,\" said Goa police chief Alok Kumar.Most of the bodies were found near the kitchen \"suggesting that the victims were employed at the club\", Mr Alok Kumar added.Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burn injuries, while others died by suffocating.He said \"three to four\" tourists had perished but did not provide their ages or nationalities. Six people are in a stable condition in hospital.A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.\"Early on Sunday emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage to determine the cause of the blaze.A heavy security presence remained at the scene, with the doors to the nightclub shut and no-one allowed inside.Rescue workers have taken the bodies of the victims to Goa Medical College in Panaji. Eight bodies have so far been identified as workers from other Indian states including Jharkhand, Assam and Uttarakhand.One of the firefighters at the scene told the BBC they were still identifying the victims and would then notify their families.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, the chief minister said.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant said.\"I am deeply grieved and offer my heartfelt condolences to all the bereaved families.\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.About 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians the BBC spoke to said that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs are opening too frequently and the government needs to ensure they are safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.",

The greeting inside reads \"Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year\".The King - standing on the left - is wearing a dark blue suit and grey tie, while the Queen is wearing a white and beige coat dress.This photograph is their fourth Christmas card since Charles became King.The image, captured by photographer Chris Jackson, was taken in the grounds of the Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence in Rome.It was taken to mark the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.The Queen is also wearing a lily of the valley brooch, a symbol of enduring love.This year's photograph, like last year's, is a more informal picture than the one chosen for Christmas 2023.Last year's picture was captured by Millie Pilkington, and was taken as the King returned to public duties following his cancer diagnosis and treatment.The couple were pictured smiling in the garden of Buckingham Palace on what appeared to be a sunny day.In 2023, the King and Queen chose a photograph of themselves in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace following the coronation.Christmas images used to decorate official festive cards are regularly released by senior members of the Royal Family.It will take the royal couple several days to personally sign all the cards, which will be sent to people across the globe including family, friends, world leaders and organisations.",

    "body": "11 minutes agoPaul Njie,Thomas Naadi,BBC Africa reportersandLucy FlemingBTVThe soldiers appeared on state TV early on Sunday morning to say they were suspending the constitutionBenin's interior minister has appeared on national TV to announce that an attempted coup in the West Africa nation has been thwarted.Earlier, a group of soldiers, led by Lt-Col Pascal Tigri, had made a broadcast saying they had ousted President Patrice Talon and suspended the constitution.In social media posts, the French embassy in Benin said gunfire had been reported near the residence of the president in the main city of Cotonou, which is the seat of government. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that they had heard gunshots and some journalists working for the state broadcaster were held hostage.A presidential adviser has since told the BBC that the president is safe and is at the French embassy.\"Early on Sunday morning, 7 December 2025, a small group of soldiers launched a mutiny aimed at destabilising the state and its institutions,\" Interior Minister Alassane Seidou said\"Faced with this situation, the Beninese armed forces and their leadership, true to their oath, remained committed to the republic. Their response allowed them to retain control of the situation and foil the attempt,\" he said.\"The government therefore urges the population to go about their activities as normal.\"Helicopters have been seen flying over Cotonou and roads are blocked with a heavy military presence on several streets in the city.Benin, a former French colony, has been regarded as one of Africa's more stable democracies.It is one of the continent's largest cotton producers, but ranks among the world's poorest countries.The French and Russian embassies have urged their citizens to stay indoors for their safety.The US embassy's advice was to stay away from Cotonou, especially the area around the presidential compound.The soldiers leading the attempted coup justified their actions by criticising President Talon's management of the country.\"The army solemnly commits to give the Beninese people the hope of a truly new era, where fraternity, justice and work prevail,\" said a statement read by one of the soldiers.Talon, who is 67 and regarded as a close ally of the West, is due to step down next year after completing his second term in office, with elections scheduled for April.A businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", he first came to power in an election in 2016. He promised not to seek a third term and has endorsed Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni as his successor.Talon has been praised by supporters for overseeing economic development, but his government has also come in for criticism for suppressing dissenting voices.In October the electoral commission barred the main opposition candidate from standing on the grounds that he did not have enough sponsors.Last month, several constitutional amendments were passed by MPs, including the creation of a second parliamentary chamber, the Senate.Terms of office for elected officials were extended from five to seven years, but the presidential two-term limit remained in place.AFPPresident Patrice Talon, a businessman known as the \"king of cotton\", has said he intends step down next year after two terms in officeThis coup attempt in Benin comes just over a week after Umaro Sissoco Embaló was overthrown as president in nearby Guinea-Bissau.In recent years, there have been several coups in West Africa, including in Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali and Niger, heightening fears that the security of the region could worsen.Russia has strengthened its ties with these Sahel countries over recent years - and Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have left the West African regional bloc Ecowas to form their own group, the Alliance of Sahel States.According to BBC Monitoring, news of the coup attempt was hailed by several pro-Russian influencer accounts on social media.Benin has seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "The death toll in Indonesia from recent flooding has passed 900, with hundreds still missing.More than 100,000 homes were destroyed when a rare and powerful cyclone formed over the Malaca Strait last week, bringing torrential rain and landslides to parts of the South East Asian country.Efforts to reach people in areas still cut off are ongoing, with aid having to be airdropped into some places.The Indonesia floods were one of several extreme weather events to hit Asia in recent weeks, with the cumulative death toll in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam approaching 2,000. In Aceh Tamiang, one of the hardest-hit areas of Indonesia, survivors described villages being entirely swept away by fast-moving deluges.One survivor in Lintang Bawah Village told the BBC Indonesian service that people survived by sitting on top of their homes.Fitriana said: \"There were also those who survived on the roofs of their houses with their four-year-old children, for three days without eating or drinking.\"She said around 90% of the homes in her village were destroyed, leaving 300 families with nowhere to go.One man recounted how he and his family were evacuated by boat when the floodwaters inundated his home up to the second floor, only for them to need to flee again from a nearby village.He said: \"That night, while we were sleeping, water suddenly soaked the mattresses we were sleeping on [in Gampoeng Dalam Village]. But we couldn't go anywhere else, because there was no higher ground.\"Luckily, my daughter-in-law's house was on two levels. So we climbed upstairs and that's where we survived.\"The region's governor said response teams were still searching for bodies in \"waist-deep\" mud, according to the AFP news agency. He said: \"Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh.\"People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That's how it is.\"Indonesian media reported inmates were released from one prison when floodwaters threatened to engulf the facility, with officials saying there was nowhere else for them to be sent.Land access to two areas, Sibolga City and Central Tapanuli, remained cut off as of Sunday, with aid only able to reach them by air and sea respectively. There have been reports of looting at supermarkets in some areas.",

    "body": "5 days agoTabby WilsonLuca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoAn Italian mayor has apologised to the family of opera star Luciano Pavarotti after the town of Pesaro encased a statue honouring the late singer within a Christmas ice rink. The singer's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, told local media that she was \"angry and upset\" at what she called the decision to \"ridicule\" her late husband. The temporary ice rink was constructed in the centre of the town's piazza, leaving Pavrotti's statue knee-deep in ice and surrounded by perspex walls. In response, Mayor Andrea Biancani said that he didn't mean to offend anyone, and admitted that his council had \"made a mistake\".Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoBefore it was opened on 29 November, Biancani posted a doctored image of Pavarotti's statue playing ice hockey with the hashtag #DaiUnCinqueAPavarotti, which translates to \"Give a high-five to Pavarotti\".\"I didn't expect a town would allow this treatment of the memory and the image of a person who made Italy great around the world,\" Ms Mantovani told local outlet Il Resto del Carlino. She accused the council of making a \"poorly executed, absurd decision\". The life-size bronze statue was officially unveiled in Pesaro in April 2024, with Ms Mantovani and the couple's daughter, Alice, in attendance. The couple often holidayed in Pesaro, where Pavarotti had a villa and was an honorary citizen.Alamy/Luca Toni/Il Resto del CarlinoOpera star Luciano Pavarotti's statue seen earlier in the year in the town of Pesaro (left), and in November, surrounded by an ice rink (right).Biancini told Il Resto del Carlino, which nicknamed the incident \"Pavarotti on Ice\", that when plans for the ice rink were initially presented to him, he was assured that the Pavarotti statue would not be touched and that it was only later that he found out designers had been forced to alter their construction. He said it would not be possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this late stage, but insisted that it would \"not happen again\".Pavarotti was an Italian tenor, and is widely known as one of the most successful opera stars of all time.His performances in the Three Tenors concerts were seen around the world, and his rendition of Nessun Dorma, from Puccini's Turandot, which he performed at the 1990 football World Cup in Italy.His final performance was at the opening of the Winter Olympics in Turin in February 2006.He died the following year at the age of 71, after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Pavarotti left behind four daughters from his two marriages. Ms Mantovani was his second wife. She remarried, to financial advisor Alberto Tinarelli, in 2020. ",

    "body": "50 minutes agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKaty Perry and former Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official after the singer posted a string of photographs and videos of their trip to Japan.In one picture, Perry and Trudeau are seen smiling for a selfie, with their faces touching. In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.Writing on X, he said: \"Great to see you @kishida230. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "Russia continued its air strikes on Ukraine overnight, hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he had a \"very constructive\" phone call with Donald Trump's negotiating team following three days of talks in Florida.Early on Sunday the mayor of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in central Ukraine, said the city had been repeatedly struck in a \"massive\" attack. No deaths have been confirmed so far.Meanwhile, Russia said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations.Aerial assaults have continued even as efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified, including detailed Ukraine-US talks in Miami aimed at drafting a peace settlement acceptable to both sides.On Saturday, Zelensky said he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the US president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the conclusion of those negotiations. Zelensky said they had discussed how to ensure that Russia stuck to any potential deal to end the war.Hours later, Kremenchuk Mayor Vitaliy Maletsk said his city had sustained a \"massive combined strike\" on its infrastructure. The extent of the damage was unclear as of Sunday morning but the mayor said water, electricity and heat had been cut off for some.The city, which is roughly halfway between Kyiv and the frontline in the east, has been repeatedly targeted since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The White House has pushed Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the US-led process.\"Ukraine is determined to keep working in good faith with the American side to genuinely achieve peace,\" Zelensky said on X. \"We covered many aspects and went through key points that could ensure an end to the bloodshed and eliminate the threat of a new Russian full scale invasion.\"The Russian strikes in the early hours of Sunday followed a wider attack 24 hours earlier, which drew condemnation from Kyiv's European allies.In a social media post, French President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to Zelensky and offered his \"full solidarity\". \"France is determined to work with all partners to secure de-escalation measures and to impose a ceasefire,\" Macron added. Macron, Zelensky, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are due to hold in-person talks in London on Monday.Europe has pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan and has sought to win support from the White House for its own proposals, including comprehensive security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, including the possibility of a peacekeeping force.Sir Keir has led the push for a so-called coalition of the willing, a loose collection of Ukrainian allies who are committed to continuing to underwrite Kyiv's defence in the event of a ceasefire to deter a second invasion. He has called that proposal \"vital\" for Ukraine's long-term security.Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected the idea of such a force saying any troops deployed to Ukraine would be \"legitimate targets\".Also on Saturday, US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\".The joint statement was issued days after Witkoff returned from talks with Putin at the Kremlin which failed to produce a breakthrough.Witkoff and Rustem Umerov, newly installed as Zelensky's most senior negotiator, said they had \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\".",

    "body": "A West Midlands Police chief did not mean to imply that members of the Jewish community had agreed with the exclusion of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from a football match in Birmingham, the force has said.Asked repeatedly by MPs on Monday if representatives of the Jewish community had said they did not want Maccabi fans attending the Europa League tie with Aston Villa on 6 November, West Midlands Assistant Chief Constable Mike O'Hara said \"yes\".The Sunday Times reported that he has since written a letter to members of the Jewish community saying he apologises.The decision to ban away fans from Villa Park was widely criticised, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"angered by the decision\".The match had been classified high risk by West Midlands police based on \"intelligence and previous incidents\".Questioned on the justification for the decision by the Home Affairs Committee on Monday, ACC O'Hara said that some Jewish community representatives in Birmingham had said they did not want Maccabi fans attending the match.\"Were members of the communities saying that they did not want the Maccabi fans there, and did that include any Jewish representatives?\" Conservative MP Karen Bradley, chair of the committee, asked.\"Yes,\" ACC O'Hara responded.Bradley asked again whether \"there were Jewish community representatives who said that they did not want the Maccabi fans there\" and ACC O'Hara said that \"a range of faiths, backgrounds and ethnicities... were very concerned\".Asked again if this included Jewish people, he said yes and added it had been documented in the force's risk analysis.A police spokesperson said: \"It was never the intention of the officer to imply that there were members of the Jewish community who had explicitly expressed support for the exclusion of Maccabi fans.\"They said the force expected further engagement with the committee and will \"ensure that this is clearly articulated as it has been with representatives of the Jewish community\".\"We recognise that this has been a difficult time for our local Jewish community, we therefore have and continue to actively engage,\" they added.In a letter to a local representative seen by the Sunday Times, ACC O'Hara wrote: \"I am aware that there is some consternation within the local Jewish community about what I presented on Monday.\"There were a number of questions asked, often with several parts and secondary points. Please can I apologise and make very clear that it was not my intention to imply that there were members of the Jewish community who had explicitly expressed support for the exclusion of Maccabi fans.\"The decision by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (Sag), a panel that includes Birmingham City Council and the police, to ban away fans was partly based on police intelligence.Giving evidence to the committee, Chief Constable Craig Guildford said the police evaluation had been based primarily on information given to the force by Dutch police commanders ahead of the game.\"The information provided from the Dutch was very, very clear in terms of they reflected on the days before, during and after the match as a result of clashes between the Maccabi ultras and the local Muslim community,\" Chief Constable Guildford said.\"In terms of what we were told, the ultras were very well organised, militaristic in the way that they operated. They attacked members of the local community, including taxi drivers. Tore down flags. People were thrown into the river.\"However, Dutch police said the force justified the ban using false intelligence about disorder involving Maccabi fans attending a game in Amsterdam last year, the Sunday Times previously reported.The government's independent adviser on antisemitism Lord Mann also told the Home Affairs Committee only one flag had been torn down the night before the game and there was only one incident with a taxi driver.In the wake of the ban, the prime minister criticised the move, saying \"we will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets\" and that the role of police was \"to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation\".The match against Aston Villa, policed by more than 700 officers, passed off without serious disorder and only a handful of arrests.Before the game hundreds of pro-Palestinian supporters and a smaller group of pro-Israeli protesters gathered outside the ground, waving banners and flags.",

    "body": "21 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, BethlehemWatch: Bethlehem Christmas tree lights up for first time since Gaza warFor two years during the Gaza war, all public celebrations for Christmas were cancelled in Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank – where Christians believe Jesus was born.But after the recent ceasefire, the holy city decided that this year the festivities would return as symbolised by the lighting of its traditional, giant Christmas tree in front of the historic Nativity Church.\"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work,\" says Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati. \"We're all living here from tourism and tourism was down to zero.\"The mayor accepts that the idea of resuming celebrations was not without controversy, as suffering continues in Gaza – including for those in its tiny Christian community, many of whom have relatives in Bethlehem.\"Some may say it's not appropriate and others say it's appropriate,\" Mr Canawati tells me. \"But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us.\"Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to BethlehemOne tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare systemAlaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurantThe grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.",

It catalogues the sorts of nightmare scenarios that give politicians sleepless nights.Alongside risks such as nuclear incidents, terrorist attacks and outbreaks of disease sits the threat of severe space weather.Image source, Nasa/Goddard/SDO/PA WireImage caption, A photo of a solar flare on the left side of the Sun hurling charged particles into spaceMuch of the planning for a severe space weather is based on the Carrington Event of 1859, the most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history.  This created rapid variations in the Earth's magnetic field that caused electricity to be generated in long wires. Telegraph operators suffered electric shocks, pylons were seen to spark and some conversations between operators could carry on while batteries were disconnected. All this happened a long time ago, but with today's advanced technologies the effects of a similar event would be far more disruptive.Satellites can be badly affected. Strong solar storms can cause the Earth's atmosphere to expand out into space, which creates more drag for satellites. This can cause them to slow down enough for some to deorbit and fall back to Earth. This is not just a theoretical risk - in February 2022 a solar storm led to the loss of 38 satellites, external.Orbital changes of satellites also increase the risk of collision and space weather can also play havoc with sensitive electronics on board, causing malfunctions.Radio communications can be badly impacted with GPS systems lost or disrupted for many days - so your car sat-nav could stop working, creating gridlock in cities. Image caption, A major solar storm could cause chaos for drivers relying on sat-nav to get aroundWithout GPS a plane's ability to operate safely would be compromised – meaning air travel would be big casualty too.Space weather has already been blamed for affecting aviation electronics. On 30 October 2025 a JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 plane flying between Cancun (Mexico) and Newark (USA) suddenly and unexpectedly lost altitude, resulting in injuries to some passengers. The plane diverted to Florida with 15 passengers taken to hospital for treatment. Airbus investigated this incident and found that space weather had corrupted data in an elevator aileron computer which sends commands to the plane's flaps. In this case it caused the plane to unexpectedly pitch down. An Emergency Airworthiness Directive, external (EAD) was issued, grounding more than 6,000 planes until a software update was installed or computers upgraded. Bad as this incident was, it could have been catastrophic.The EAD states that \"in the worst-case scenario an uncommanded elevator movement may result in exceeding the aircraft's structural capability\".Image source, Bill Clarke/Getty ImagesImage caption, A JetBlue Airlines Airbus A320 landing in Washington DC.Electricity grids can also fail, causing power cuts. In March 1989 the Canadian province of Quebec was hit by a power cut caused by space weather with millions left without power and heat for nine hours. What are the chances of another Carrington event?In July 2012 a Carrington-class event narrowly missed hitting the planet. The sun rotates once every 25 days and by good luck the active area of the sun was not pointing straight at earth - so this dangerous space weather was flung harmlessly beyond Earth and out into space.And it is even possible that we could see something bigger.Researchers have discovered evidence in tree ring data from fossilised wood that suggests we could get events perhaps ten times larger than the Carrington event.Miyake events, named after the scientist who discovered them, could pose a threat to modern society on a scale that is hard to comprehend. With the last one identified around a thousand years ago, you could argue it's just a matter of time.",

    "body": "12 hours agoRyley BowmanBBC Scotland NewsBBCKyle, 21 got a PSP to relive his childhoodGen Z are going retro. People in their teens and early 20s are increasingly turning to old school tech in a bid to unplug from the online world. Amazon UK told BBC Scotland News that retro-themed products surged in popularity during its Black Friday event, with portable vinyl turntables, Tamagotchis and disposable cameras among their best sellers.Retailers Currys and John Lewis also said they had seen retro gadgets making a comeback with sales of radios, instant cameras and alarm clocks showing big jumps.'There's something authentic about having DVDs'Declan says the main selling point of DVDs is the casesWhile some people scroll endlessly through Netflix in search of their next watch, 17-year-old Declan prefers the more traditional approach of having a DVD in his hands.He grew up surrounded by his gran's collection and later bought his own after visiting a shop with a friend.\"The main selling point for me is the cases,\" he says.\"There's something about really clean cases that I love.\"Streaming services like Netflix and Disney+ dominate the market but Declan says he values ownership.\"It's nice to have something you own instead of paying for subscriptions all the time,\" he says. \"If I lost access to streaming tomorrow, I'd still have my favourite movies ready to watch.\"He admits DVDs are a \"dying way of watching movies\" but that makes them cheaper.\"I think they're just cool, there's something authentic about having DVDs,\" he says.\"These things are generations old, it's nice to have them available.\"'The grooves on the record make it feel real'Saul has spent  more than £1,000 on old vinyl recordsSaul, 20, has been collecting vinyl records since 2016.With new vinyl albums costing about £35 on average, it might seem expensive compared to streaming but Saul feels it's worth it.\"It's a more authentic sound,\" he says. \"The grooves on the record make it feel real, you can hear the difference.\"It's about having something physical you can look at instead of just scrolling through your phone mindlessly.\"For Saul, the appeal goes beyond sound quality. \"You've got the actual cover art, and you put the disc down yourself, it's a hands-on experience.\" he says.Saul admits that vinyl's popularity might not last forever.\"For a lot of people, I think vinyl is just a trend,\" he says. \"It's the same way things come and go, like different trends on social media. \"Once it becomes too expensive, people will click off it,\" he says.\"I'll still collect because I like to have them. I like having that option to listen.\"'Physical cameras are timeless'Aoibheann's favourite camera is an old Pentax Espio film cameraWhile most people instinctively reach for their phones to take photos, 21-year-old Aoibheann prefers the deliberate artistry of traditional cameras.\"There's something about the quality of them and the style of photo you get, it's unmatched compared to your phone.\" she says.\"There's more pressure with film because you're not going to see the photo straight away, you have to wait. But that's the novelty of it,\" she explains.\"I'll take my camera to birthdays, holidays, even walks,\" she says.Aoibheann believes the appeal of traditional cameras runs deeper than aesthetics.It is rooted in nostalgia, she says.\"Many people are curious about the experience of using physical cameras because they grew up seeing their parents use them,\" she says.\"Gen Z enjoys the novelty of something we don't usually have. It's a break from phones and instant gratification.\"Physical cameras are timeless. They'll never go out of fashion because past generations relied on them.\"'It's more addictive than any game I've got on my PS5.'The PSP sold 185,000 units in the UK during its first four days on the market in 2005Kyle, 21 got a PSP to relive his childhood and enjoy the nostalgic simplicity of gaming without modern hassles like updates or downloads.The PSP (PlayStation Portable) is a handheld gaming console made by Sony that became an instant hit in the UK when it was introduced in 2005 but was discontinued a decade later as technology moved on.\"It was the first game console that I grew up with, it's a weird feeling, it's like a home comfort, you know? It feels retro,\" he says.\"Obviously the screen isn't as good, the buttons aren't as good, it's a lot more unreliable, but that's not the point.\"When you play a modern PlayStation or Xbox, you can't just play, you need to download updates. With a PSP, you put a game in and play\".Kyle says: \"Since I got it, I've used it almost every day. I've been playing Need for Speed on my PSP, it's more addictive than any game I've got on my PS5.\"Embodying the streamlined look of early-2000s technology, the PSP resurgence could be seen as just another passing trend.\"I feel like there's definitely a performative aspect to it, almost like an accessory for some people.\" he says.\"For the majority, it's just a fad, a trend. But for people like me, I'll be playing this until it breaks.\"",

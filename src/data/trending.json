    "body": "Media caption, 'I came here to be the manager, not to be the coach' - Amorim on future at UnitedByManchester United reporter at Elland RoadUpdated 2 minutes agoRuben Amorim has challenged Manchester United's hierarchy to let him do his job without interference.After hinting on Friday at issues behind the scenes, Amorim waited until the final question of his post-match media conference after the 1-1 draw at Leeds United to make another significant point.In the process, he repeatedly stated he was ready to move on when his contract expires in 18 months' time, indicating he had encountered unwanted intrusion in his duties from senior United figures that would not be tolerated elsewhere.He brought up the names of three high-profile former Premier League bosses and suggested they would not be subjected to the interference he feels he has experienced.\"I just want to say I came here to be the manager, not to be the coach,\" he said.\"In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director – [they] need to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"Amorim also floated the idea that United have become too sensitive to outside criticism.He said: \"If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.\"Media caption, A fall out behind the scenes at Man Utd?Neville is one of a number of high-profile former United players who have been massively critical of the club recently.The former captain described the home draw with bottom-of-the-table Wolves on 30 December as \"the baddest of the bad\".Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast following Amorim's comments on Sunday, Neville said: \"Something has happened in the last week which means that Amorim is starting to unleash a little bit.\"It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy.\"Obviously something is annoying him - he's obviously not feeling the support. He's obviously letting go.\"When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.\"Last month, Neville's fellow 'Class of 92' member Paul Scholes said Amorim \"doesn't get\" Manchester United because of his preference to play a three-man defensive formation with wing-backs, which goes against the club's tradition of playing with wingers.Amorim changed the system to four at the back for the victory over Newcastle on Boxing Day but reverted to a back three for subsequent games, including at Leeds.A recent report claimed Christopher Vivell, United's head of recruitment, called on Amorim to adapt his system after a particularly detailed explanation by Fulham boss Marco Silva of his plan to counter it following the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage in August.Amorim has said there have been disagreements with the club over transfer targets, while hints at growing tensions with director of football Jason Wilcox have been getting stronger.Amorim's 18-month plan - unless board 'decides to change'Media caption, Leeds denied win as Cunha hits back for UnitedWhen asked if he still feels he has the confidence of the United hierarchy, Amorim said: \"To start with that, I noticed that you received selective information about everything.\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change.\"I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"While United officials have tried to create a picture of harmony, their words are being tested by Amorim, who was named as 'head coach' when the club announced his arrival as the successor of Erik ten Hag – who was the manager – on 1 November 2024.Amorim still believes United are moving in the right direction despite a run of one win in five games and three in 11.It remains to be seen if his comments have any immediate impact. Amorim is next due to speak to the media on Tuesday, before his side's trip to Burnley the following evening.'Now the situation has become serious' - analysisImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim before the 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland RoadAmorim was given the chance to fully explain his post-match comments at Elland Road. Instead, he elected to leave the media room and let the journalists try to work it out for themselves.He adopted a similar approach on Friday when he cryptically suggested there had been disagreements over recruitment, potentially in the wake of an attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo ending in failure.As it stands, we don't know if Amorim wanted the £65m that United were willing to spend on Semenyo relocated to another part of his team, which badly needs reinforcements.What we do know about is his belief that managers need influence over recruitment. That is because he explained it when he spoke to the media after the 1-0 win over Newcastle on 26 December, as he looked ahead to the Wolves game.He said then: \"Sometimes I have one idea, Jason [Wilcox] and the board has another idea, [but] every decision we make we need to reach a common ground.\"That is really important. You don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change and [then] you need to change everything. But you also need to understand [that] the manager understands the way of playing.\"It hinted at a divergence of opinion and Amorim has done nothing to quell that idea. Now, the situation is becoming serious.On Tuesday, Amorim is bound to be asked for the clarification he refused to give at Elland Road.At what point does Wilcox – who has not spoken publicly to the media other than one 'safe' club interview – get involved? Or chief executive Omar Berrada? Or minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe? Or the Glazers?Amorim spoke a lot at Leeds about the next 18 months, in the sense that if he is left alone until the end of his contract, everyone can move on. But the modern football world is not like that.United's position in the table remains more or less as it was before the Leeds game. In pure league position terms, they are on track to qualify for Europe, which is the target Amorim was given this summer.But it is impossible to imagine the current tension being allowed to simmer for another 18 months.Amorim clearly thinks the parameters of the job he was sold have changed. Berrada flew to Portugal in the wake of Ten Hag's dismissal and persuaded him to leave Sporting immediately - rather than wait until the summer as he pleaded to do.It appears that where we have ended up is not to Amorim's liking.The big questions, therefore, are these.If Amorim cannot accept where United are now, are the club willing to alter their vision?If not, regardless of their position in the table, what will they do about it?United boss backs misfiring SeskoAmorim is not being helped by the form of £73.7m striker Benjamin Sesko.The Slovenian has scored only two goals in 16 appearances and wasted more opportunities against Leeds, including the visitors' best opportunity to get a winner when he sent Joshua Zirkzee's low cross wide from six yards despite being in front of the goal.It is now nine games since he found the net, against Sunderland on 4 October, and the decision to bring Sesko in as a replacement for Rasmus Hojlund, who has moved to Napoli on loan after two underwhelming seasons as United's number nine and has scored nine goals in 21 games, is now open to question.Not that Amorim sees the situation in quite such clear terms.\"Ben has completely different characteristics to Rasmus and he is doing the right things,\" Amorim said.\"I know as a striker, if you miss chances they [outside critics] will say the player did everything wrong, but to miss the chances he's missing, he has to be there. That's the first step.\"He just needs to score one, then all the weight will disappear and he will be better.\"Media caption, How Cunha is carrying the Utd burden",

    "body": "New powers allowing mobile phones to be seized from illegal migrants without arresting them have come into force. The government said it will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings to the UK.The Home Office said seizures will begin on Monday at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, with technology on site ready to download intelligence from devices.Officers will be able to demand that migrants remove their coats to search for phones and also check their mouths for SIM cards.The National Crime Agency said the information collected could speed up investigations into smuggling gangs.Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.\"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.\"The Refugee Council said it was important that the new powers were used proportionately. It said phones were a lifeline for vulnerable people who needed to remain in contact with their families.Mike Tapp, minister for migration and citizenship, said seized phones could later be returned but that would \"depend on the individual circumstances... what's found on that phone. That's for the guys on the ground to make that operational decision.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: \"If people have devices... that could hold intelligence, then we are right to be able to seize that. But that  doesn't take away compassion.\" The new law also introduces offences that could leave perpetrators facing up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour had confined itself to \"cosmetic tweaks\" and that there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel.He said the Conservatives would leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something Labour has rejected in favour of reforming the treaty.\"With more than 41,000 people arriving in 2025, the government needs to get a proper grip on the situation,\" he added.Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could face five years in prison.Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, said more than 4,000 disruptions against smuggling gangs had taken place since his unit was set up, including seizing cash and convicting key players.He said Monday marked a \"key moment\" to go further with extra tools to crack down on smugglers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also announced plans for \"significant changes\" to the asylum system to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterPA MediaJunk food adverts are banned on television and online starting today as part of a drive to tackle childhood obesity.  The UK-wide ban stops food and drinks high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) being advertised on TV before 21:00 and at any time online.It applies to products considered to be the biggest drivers of childhood obesity, including soft drinks, chocolates and sweets, pizzas and ice creams.The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said it is committed to helping people eat healthily and has been voluntarily abiding by the new restrictions since October.As well as more obviously unhealthy foods, the ban also covers some breakfast cereals and porridges, sweetened bread products, and main meals and sandwiches.Decisions over which products fall under the ban are based on a scoring tool, balancing their nutrient levels against whether they are high in saturated fat, salt, or sugar.Plain oats and most porridge, muesli and granola are not banned under the crackdown, but some versions with added sugar, chocolate or syrup could be affected.Firms can still promote healthier versions of banned products, which the government hopes will lead to food makers developing healthier recipes.The ban only covers adverts in which unhealthy products can be seen by viewers, meaning fast-food firms will still be able to advertise using their brand name.Previously, HFSS food and drink adverts were banned on any platform where more than a quarter of the audience was under 16.Firms that do not comply with the new rules risk action by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).NHS data shows almost one in 10 (9.2%) reception-aged children are now living with obesity, while one in five children have tooth decay by the age of five.It is estimated obesity costs the NHS more than £11bn every year.Evidence shows children's exposure to ads for unhealthy food can influence what they eat from a young age, in turn putting them at greater risk of becoming overweight or obese.The government estimates the ad ban will prevent around 20,000 cases of childhood obesity.Katherine Brown, professor of behaviour change in health at the University of Hertfordshire, said the ban was \"long overdue and a move in the right direction\".She said: \"Children are highly susceptible to aggressive marketing of unhealthy foods and exposure to them puts them at greater risk of developing obesity and associated chronic diseases.\"Ms Brown called for the government to make nutritious options \"more affordable, accessible and appealing\".The FDF said manufacturers are \"committed to working in partnership with the government and others to help people make healthier choices\".It added: \"Investing in developing healthier products has been a key priority for food and drink manufacturers for many years and as a result, our members' products now have a third of the salt and sugar and a quarter of the calories than they did ten years ago.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

You were loved by so many people, and we will all miss you forever.\"A loving husband, father, son, brother and the best grandad anybody could ever wish for. Sleep tight, we love you, we miss you.\"Mr Ratcliffe's son, in a Facebook post, thanked the RNLI, HM coastguards and the emergency services who had done \"all they could\" and worked tirelessly and relentlessly in awful weather conditions.\"Bye Dad, I miss you and I will never forget the true hero and role model you were,\" he wrote.Police said both families were being supported by specially trained officers.BBC/Joe BiltonThe police said officers were continuing to search for Grace KeelingAt 15:10 GMT on Friday, the coastguard responded to reports of \"a number of people in difficulty\" in the water.What followed was a huge search and rescue operation involving about 100 emergency workers, a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington, Skegness and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.The coastguard stood down their search at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon.The RNLI thanked members of the public who they said had \"assisted and supported\" the emergency services.\"This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families, friends and all those impacted,\" they said in a statement on Sunday.BBC/Becki BowdenFloral tributes have been placed close to the scene on the promenadePaul Whitehead, owner of Castle Cafe on the promenade said he had handed three minutes of CCTV footage taken from the front of the cafe over to the police.Mr Whitehead said several people ran across to help including two members of his staff. He said a lifebelt at the foot of the towers on the seafront was thrown into the sea to help the young woman but the undertow took her away.\"It's just an accident,\" he said, \"a tragic accident, and it has affected the town deeply.\"Mr Whitehead said he had lit three candles in St Matthew's Methodist church on Sunday, one for each of the three victims.Services took place at the church earlier to allow people to reflect on what had happened. People have also placed flowers on the promenade.  Janice Holgate, who travelled from Hull, said it had been \"absolutely devastating\" to hear what had happened.\"I had to pay my respects just to let the families know that people are thinking about them,\" she said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "7 hours agoAlex BishBBC South East InvestigationsGetty ImagesA total of 57 million doses of unauthorised medication have been confiscated by government agencies over the last five yearsPatients who buy illicit painkillers, erectile dysfunction pills and other unlicensed medicines on the black market are risking their health, a doctor is warning, after millions of doses were seized. Figures obtained by the BBC show more than 57 million doses of unauthorised medication have been confiscated in the UK by government agencies in the last five years.Julian Spinks, a GP in Medway, Kent, said there was a risk of buying a dummy pill, a completely different medication or the correct drug at the wrong dose.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: \"Products purchased in this way will not meet our strict quality and safety standards, and taking such medicines may put your health at risk.\"Missed health checksThe seizures between 2020/21 and 2024/25 also included unlicensed painkillers, anti-anxiety medication and sleeping tablets.More than 34 million doses were seized in the two most recent years, according to data released in a Freedom of Information request to the MHRA.In the last year, unlicensed drugs for erectile dysfunction were the most common item seized.Dr Spinks said he was not surprised some patients were buying the drugs online.\"A lot of them are very embarrassed and don't want to talk to their doctor about it,\" he said.\"However, they are missing out on the additional checks doctors do to make sure they can take it safely and to look for underlying causes.\"There's a good chance they're buying a dummy pill and they are wasting their money.\"GP Julian Spinks says there is no way of knowing the dose of illegally traded medicineThe MHRA said the second most common medicine seized in the last financial year was the painkiller Tramadol.Dr Spinks told the BBC there was an increasing reluctance in the NHS to prescribe the opiate because there were \"more risks than benefits to long-term use\".\"This drug does cause tolerance and addiction,\" he said.\"There can be considerable variation in the strength of the drugs, so there is a much bigger danger of overdose.\"Masking symptomsAnother major concern is that these medicines can mask symptoms without treating the underlying problem, according to Surrey doctor David Triska.He said: \"Someone may feel temporary relief from pain, anxiety or insomnia, but the root cause remains unaddressed.\"Dr Triska, who is a GP in Witley, said this could delay proper assessment and treatment and, in some cases, allowed serious conditions to worsen before help was finally sought.\"From a clinical point of view, we often end up seeing people later and sicker than we otherwise would,\" he said.\"There is also a widespread misconception that if something is easy to buy online, it must be safe.\"Kim Webster's 17-year-old son William Horley died in 2018 after taking Tramadol recreationally with a friend.\"It just breaks my heart still,\" she said. \"Life is just so precious and being that person that's living through my son dying from drugs bought online, things need to change.\"You can get them [Tramadol] prescribed from a doctor. Why are they getting these online?\"Ms Webster, from Herne Bay, has since given awareness talks to tens of thousands of pupils on behalf of the Kenward Trust, a Kent-based charity.She said: \"I'm shocked at the age they actually know about [drugs]. There are some children so switched on with what is out there and how to use things and how to get them, it's so scary.\"Kim WebsterKim has campaigned about drugs awareness since her son William Horley died aged 17 The MHRA seizes drugs which are counterfeit, sold illegally without a prescription, or genuine medicines which do not have a licence for use in the UK.The government agency said the biggest challenge was from medicines that were unlicensed or unapproved for use in the UK, which were often smuggled into the country across borders.\"Buying any medicine from unauthorised suppliers significantly increases the risk of getting a product which is either falsified or not licensed for use in the UK,\" said Andy Morling, MHRA's deputy director of criminal enforcement.\"We will continue to work closely with law enforcement agencies, international partners and others to prevent the illegal supply of medicines and to protect patients.\"The government recently launched a new awareness campaign about the risks of taking drugs, including the use of counterfeit medicines.

    "body": "The Cuban government has said 32 of its nationals were killed during the US operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.It said the dead were members of its armed forces and intelligence agencies, with two days of national mourning declared.A short statement did not elaborate on the role of the Cubans in Venezuela, but the two governments are long-standing allies, with Cuba providing security support in exchange for oil.Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said they had been providing protection to Maduro and his wife \"at the request\" of Venezuela. An official government statement read: \"Our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell, after fierce resistance, in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of bombings on the facilities.\"Venezuela has not confirmed how many people were killed during the US raid on Maduro's compound in Caracas on Saturday.  The New York Times, citing an unnamed Venezuelan official, reported on Sunday that the death toll stood at 80 and was expected to rise. BBC News has not independently verified that report. In the days following the capture of Maduro, questions have been raised over whether the Trump administration could consider a similar operation against Cuba, which, like Venezuela, has had decades of adversarial relations with the US.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said military action would not be necessary because \"Cuba is ready to fall\". He continued: \"I don't think we need any action. Looks like it's going down. It's going down for the count.\"On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Cuba as a \"disaster\" run by \"incompetent, senile men\". \"If I lived in Havana, and I was in the government, I'd be concerned - at least a little bit,\" Rubio said.In July last year, Trump signed a memorandum imposing tighter restrictions on Cuba, reversing moves by his predecessor Joe Biden easing pressure on the Caribbean island nation. The White House said it would end \"economic practices that disproportionately benefit the Cuban government, military, intelligence, or security agencies at the expense of the Cuban people\".It also said existing restrictions on Americans visiting Cuba would be more stringently enforced. During his first term as president, Trump took a similar approach to Cuba, implementing a raft of additional sanctions.His administration has continued an economic embargo on Cuba, despite calls by international organisations including the United Nations to end it. The blockade was initially imposed in 1962 and has been in place ever since. ",

Strong winds have been causing drifting, with Network Rail Scotland reporting snow drifts up to 1.2m (4ft) on the line between Aberdeen and Dundee. Scottish regional airline Loganair cancelled flights from Aberdeen and Inverness airports on Sunday and Monday following heavy snowfall.As the snow showers become heavier and more frequent during Sunday night, the Met Office is warning for the potential of another 20 to 30cm of snow.Further road and rail closures are possible and disruption to power is likely in some areas too.The Met Office also warned that mobile phone coverage could be affected.Hundreds of schools in northern Scotland will stay shut after the Christmas holidays on Monday.The return of pupils has been delayed in Aberdeenshire, Shetland and Orkney, while schools in Aberdeen will have a later start.A number of schools in Northern Ireland will also be closed on Monday. A full list is available here.Image caption, Most areas of the UK are covered by Met Office snow and ice warnings on MondayNumerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued in each of the four nations.Yellow warnings for snow and ice covering Wales, the Midlands and south-west England and parts of the Midlands came into force on Sunday evening at 20:00 and are due to run until 11:00 on Monday.Ahead of the Monday rush hour, the Met Office has highlighted the risk of longer journey times by road and rail on Monday and Tuesday morning, as well as the potential for slips and falls on pavements and cycle routes.Parts of Scotland have a yellow snow and ice warning in place until the end of Tuesday.There is a potential for another 5 to 10cm of snow at low levels, and 20 to 30cm on high ground for much of the Highlands and Aberdeenshire areas, Orkney, Shetland, and Outer Hebridean Islands, PA media reports.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / frazmanscoopImage caption, There were no signs of drivers on this snow-covered country road in OrkneyHow long will cold weather last?Clear skies on Saturday night brought plunging temperatures as England and Wales registered their coldest night of the winter so far.  The mercury dropped to -9.3C at Benson in Oxfordshire and -7.3C at Sennybridge in Powys.Sunday night into Monday morning was expected to be even colder with temperatures of -10C or -11C for forecast for some rural parts of Scotland and Wales.Cold weather health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency remain in place across all of England until Friday. The HSA warns that the prolonged cold spell could lead a rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly or those with underlying health conditions.In Plymouth, four city centre churches have opened their doors to the homeless due to the drop in temperatures, and will offer hot drinks, clean bedding and specialist support.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / silver surferImage caption, Houses in Whitby, North Yorkshire, provided a splash of colour amid the snowfallWill snow, sleet or rain fall?Atlantic weather fronts are likely to bring more snow through this week. The difficulty for forecasters will be pinpointing the fine temperature boundaries that dictate where snow, sleet or rain falls.The coldest air is likely to persist over the northern half of the UK and bands of snow of varying intensity could cause disruption.Image caption, The position of a low pressure system later this week will be key to where we will see snow, sleet or heavy rain Towards the end of the week, a greater temperature contrast is expected across the UK as a deep area of low pressure swings in, fired up by an active jet stream overhead.It is too early to say exactly when and where this area of low pressure will cross the UK, however. The track will be crucial as there is likely to be a spell of heavy snow on the northern edge of the low and heavy rain to the south. Strong winds may also bring some disruption too.Keep up to date with the latest BBC Weather forecasts on the app and online.",

    "body": "Teen girl educated in UK confirmed to have died in Swiss bar fire8 hours agoThomas MackintoshCharlotte Niddam/TikTokA former pupil at two British schools has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in a fire at a Swiss ski resort.In a post on social media, Charlotte Niddam's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.It comes as officials in Switzerland said on Sunday that they had identified all 40 victims of the New Year's Day fire in a bar in Crans-Montana.Charlotte, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College, a private school in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London.In the statement on Facebook, Charlotte's family wrote: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"Details regarding the funeral arrangements will follow shortly. It is most likely on Thursday in Paris.\"Thank you for all your support those last few days.\"According to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.Yvette Cooper said  it was \"terrible news\" that Charlotte had been identified as one of victims of the fire.\"My thoughts are with all her family and friends after this devastating loss,\" she wrote on X.After the blaze, Immanuel College had said it was \"praying for a miracle\".Swiss President Guy Parmelin has called the fire \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.The bar that was the scene of the fire, Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana, was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating New Year's Day in the early hours of Thursday when the blaze began in the basement area.Prosecutors say that, according to initial investigations, the likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried \"too close to the ceiling\".An investigation into the causes of the blaze will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.On Sunday, Valais cantonal police said all victims had been identified and were aged between 14 and 39 years old.The victims came from seven countries - though several held multiple nationalities.Swiss police said one of those victims identified was a 15-year-old who held triple citizenship with France, Israel and the UK. Other nationalities include Portuguese, Romanian, Belgian, French, Italian and Swiss.Another 35 people who were injured in the fire have been transferred to specialist burns units outside Switzerland as the country struggles to cope with the scale of the tragedy.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "5 hours agoThomas MackintoshReutersDenmark's prime minister has told Donald Trump to \"stop the threats\" about taking over Greenland.Mette Frederiksen said \"it makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland\", adding: \"The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom.\"Her remarks come after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's aides, Stephen Miller - tweeted a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word \"SOON\".Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of Greenland becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth, and doubled down on his claims after Frederiksen's comments. In her statement, posted on the Danish government website, Frederiksen said she was addressing the US \"very directly\".She said Denmark - \"and thus Greenland\" - was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee. Denmark already had a defence agreement with the US that gave it access to Greenland, she said, and Denmark had upped its investment in security in the Arctic region.\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,\" she said.Hours later on Air Force One, Trump reiterated the goal. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,\" he said.Earlier the Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Mrs Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.The exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this story",

    "body": "The 'happy little town' left reeling from sea deaths13 hours agoKevin Shoesmithin WithernseaKevin Shoesmith/BBCThe Reverend Clive Hall says Withernsea is pulling together following Friday's sea tragedyAfter a sea tragedy which left a man and a woman dead, with a teenage girl still missing, the small East Yorkshire resort of Withernsea is a community in mourning. Residents speak of their pain but also of their resolve to support one another and the families affected.The contrast is as stark as the wind driving snow into the faces of rescuers - wrapped-up families carrying buckets and spades heading to the beach to build snowmen, as weary coastguard officials in blue overalls and hi-vis jackets search for a missing person.On Friday, two people died after being pulled from the water at Withernsea - a town with a population of just 6,500.The victims were 67-year-old Mark Ratcliffe, who died trying to save the others, and 45-year-old Sarah Keeling.Her daughter, Grace Keeling,15, remains missing, although HM Coastguard confirmed the sea search for them was called off at 16:00 GMT on Saturday.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCFamilies trudge through snow on Withernsea's promenade From our vantage point next to the castellated entrance to a former pier, which was destroyed by storms and ship collisions in the late 19th Century, the Reverend Clive Hall, from the town's St Matthew's Church, also spots the families on the promenade. \"Withernsea is a fun place,\" he says.\"It's a place people come to enjoy themselves, even in winter. It's a lot smaller and quieter than Bridlington further up the coast.\"We are very close-knit here. But now we have tears and heartbreak. The mood is sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCThe tragedy is said to have happened near to The Towers, a local landmark in WithernseaMr Hall tells me how the town's five churches have come together, with clergy converging on Withernsea Methodist Church, which has become the focus for prayers.On Sunday, services reflected the town's loss.\"People are already talking about a special service. That will be something to consider at a later point,\" Mr Hall says.Angie Smith, 51, from Hull, is walking with her family. She too associates Withernsea with happy memories.\"It's always been a happy little seaside town,\" she says.\"What an awful start to the year this is.\"Like us, those people [those who died] will have gone to the seaside for a walk and then this happened.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCCoastguard officials search the beach in a snowstorm for the missing person Darrin Stevens' photographs showing the initial search and rescue efforts have been  widely published.Now, he stands - without a camera - on the promenade, reflecting on events, as a woman lays a bouquet of flowers. \"The balcony of my home overlooks the sea,\" he says, pointing to it.\"Within minutes, all I could see was a wall of flashing blue lights.\"Mr Stevens did not see anyone in the water, with the seawall saving him from witnessing the tragedy.Like Mr Hall, he describes a town that supports each other.\"So many people came down on to the promenade on Friday evening,\" he says.\"They weren't there taking pictures for social media; they were there to show support.\"My neighbours brought coffees and teas for the rescuers. People just wanted to help in any way they could. It was remarkable for all the wrong reasons.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCWithernsea-based photographer Darrin Stevens captured the initial emergency response to the tragedyJason Catlin, 45, who lives opposite the town's RNLI station, agrees with those sentiments.\"Even though something like this does not directly affect everyone, everyone feels it,\" he says.\"It feels really sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJason Catlin says the town \"feels sombre\"Friends David Lewis, 69, and Neil Finn, 63, know this stretch of coastline well, and they tell of the dangers.Gesturing to the road that runs parallel to the promenade, a good distance from the sea, Mr Lewis says: \"I used to be a road sweep for the council and I'd often find pebbles and wood, thrown up by the sea, scattered all along here after a storm.\" Mr Finn adds: \"I've seen the sea come up over the towers before.\"The sea can be very dangerous.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCNeil Finn and David Lewis say the sea can be perilous even to those walking on the promenadeDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "7 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve have been identified by police.The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.In addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified. A criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He \"has left to party in paradise\", she said.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonLe Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireThe French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".A teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire. Charlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.In a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

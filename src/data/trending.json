    "body": "Hamas ruled Gaza with an iron rod - will it really give up control?15 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem andRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated into a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Additional reporting: BBC MonitoringTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "It was not supposed to be this way for Nottingham Forest. One game away from the Champions League in May. Now, in October, they sit in the Premier League relegation zone with a third manager in six weeks. Sean Dyche has replaced Ange Postecoglou on a deal until the summer of 2027, following the Australian's sacking just 17 minutes after Saturday's 3-0 defeat by Chelsea - ending his 39-day reign. Postecoglou was bullish, telling the squad winning the Europa League was a target, but he left as Forest's and the Premier League's shortest-serving permanent manager.The SOS call to Dyche had already arrived before the weekend, as owner Evangelos Marinakis assessed his options during the international break.The former Everton and Burnley manager, a Nottingham resident and former Forest academy player, has answered as the club look to restore confidence and identity to a season which has already unravelled via self-inflicted wounds.But is Dyche the right man for the job? Forest backed themselves into a corner after the failed Postecoglou experiment.They wanted the new man in before Thursday's Europa League visit of Porto - and Dyche has to restore the organisation and solidity which was so evident under Nuno Espirito Santo, who took them to seventh in the Premier League last season.Centre-backs Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic were nervous with Postecoglou's more open style, while Matz Sels, who shared the Golden Glove with Arsenal's David Raya last season, is yet to keep a clean sheet this term and was culpable for at least one goal against Chelsea. Elliot Anderson is someone who has maintained his form and has had the most touches, 807, in the Premier League this season - but the midfielder is an exception to the rule. It means Dyche will immediately need to understand the make-up and psychology of the squad after Forest spent £180m on 13 new players in the summer transfer window. About £120m of talent was left out of the squad altogether on Saturday - James McAtee, Dilane Bakwa, Arnaud Kalimuendo and record signing Omari Hutchinson - with just two summer signings, loanees Douglas Luiz and Oleksandr Zinchenko, starting. Sources close to the squad feel they have too many players and too many of the same type.The unity which had been so pivotal has been disrupted by Nuno's departure and Dyche must restore that.\"He's one of the most charismatic men, he walks into a room and he demands the attention of the room,\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who played under Dyche for 18 months at Burnley. \"I always reacted really well to man managers, people whose door was always open and told you the truth whether you liked it or not, and that's one of Sean's great qualities.\"He's a leader of men, he gets the respect from the dressing room immediately. At times, he's been criticised for the way he plays, but he gets results and the thing I responded to and reacted to, he's able to get the best out of players who may not be at the top level.\"There's players in that Nottingham Forest squad - Morgan Gibbs-White, Elliot Anderson, Neco Williams, Callum Hudson-Odoi - those type of players will absolutely love playing under Sean Dyche. He will be a manager who they will excel with.\"Forest started the season with European ambitions again and Postecoglou was brought in to win trophies, but they are having to reset to go forward again. Dyche took Burnley to seventh in 2017-18, the Clarets qualifying for Europe for the first time in more than 50 years.But Everton finished 17th and 15th under him, so will the 54-year-old be able to win the Europa League?  \"I think they can still do it, the squad of players is still there,\" said Robinson. \"It's changing the mentality. A losing run is hard to get out of but, if anyone could do that, he's the type of man to do it. \"He doesn't want to get labelled with the likes of Sam Allardyce, like a firefighter coming in, the trouble-shooter to keep teams in the Premier League. He's got an opportunity now where he can be a builder.\"He's got a great squad of players. Yes, there's a financial constraint on them but when you look at the squad, it doesn't need that much work this season.\"It's just a great fit for him. It's almost one of those jobs he's been waiting for.\"PPDA is passes allowed per defensive action. It measures how often teams wait until interrupting a spell of opposition possession - whether that's winning the ball back or getting a foot in to concede a throw-in or corner. Teams aggressively trying to win the ball back will have a lower figure - teams prepared to soak up pressure will have a higher figure.Direct speed is how quickly the ball moves towards the opponents' goal during a sequence of possession, measured in metres per second.Going from Nuno to Dyche via Postecoglou in less than six weeks highlights the muddled thinking at the City Ground. Wanting to progress is one thing, it is entirely different when you implode and make the wrong calls - even with the best intentions. Forest are in their fourth season back in the Premier League after 23 years out of it, Steve Cooper winning promotion in 2022, with Marinakis having brought Postecoglou in to challenge for trophies. Instead they are facing a relegation battle and Matt Davies, host of the popular Forest Focus podcast, believes fans need to be realistic after Dyche's appointment. \"It's probably a dose of reality,\" he said. \"We went into the season full of optimism, coming off the back of our best season and huge investment in the squad.\"But you have to look at the situation in front of you and we're in the relegation zone. It's only eight games but it's a bad year to be bad, when you know the promoted teams aren't awful. \"So at least one established, if we qualify as one, Premier League club is going to go down. You'd have to go straight back up and if we don't we could take all sorts of steps back. \"There's a huge amount of fear from Forest fans that we were in the wilderness for 23 years. We absolutely don't want to go back there, and we don't want to go back there in the most self-inflicted fashion you could imagine. \"You've got to get this right and if a dose of reality is Sean Dyche, the dose of reality is Sean Dyche.\" The blame game over how Forest found themselves here has already started, but Davies is cautious to point the finger.\"It's too simple just to throw one name in there and say, 'oh, it's all the owner, it's all Ange','\" he said. \"There's four names on there, Nuno, Marinakis, Postecoglou and Edu are the names that have been central to the club since the end of last season.\"A lot of people need to take a step back and work out what's gone wrong and how we fix it, how we bring a measure of stability to this season before it really cascades into an absolute nightmare.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoDavid SpereallYorkshireWest Yorkshire PoliceIan Watkins was killed at HMP Wakefield on 11 OctoberTwo men have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder in connection with the death of singer Ian Watkins at HMP Wakefield.The former Lostprophets frontman, who was serving a 29-year sentence for child sex offences, died after being attacked at the high-security jail on 11 October.West Yorkshire Police said the men, aged 23 and 39, were arrested at the jail on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.Det Ch Insp James Entwistle said: \"Extensive enquiries remain ongoing in relation to the murder of Ian Watkins and these arrests form part of that.\"He added: \"Ian Watkins' family are being updated as the investigation progresses.\"However, we do not anticipate any immediate developments at this stage.\"The force said both men were \"in police custody and will be interviewed over the course of today, they will then be bailed and returned to prison while enquiries continue\".Two men, 25-year-old Rico Gedel and 43-year-old Samuel Dodsworth, have already been charged with murder and are due to stand trial in May 2026. An inquest into Watkins' death is due to open at Wakefield Coroner's Court on Friday.Watkins was jailed in 2013 after he admitted 13 offences, including the attempted rape of a baby. Prior to his conviction he had been the frontman of the rock band Lostprophets.Formed in Pontypridd in 1997, the four-piece became one of the UK's biggest bands, securing 11 top 40 hits and a number one album between 2002 and 2010.In a statement released after his conviction, the band's remaining members said they were \"heartbroken, angry, and disgusted\" at his crimes, adding that their \"hearts go out\" to his victims.Last month a report on conditions at HMP Wakefield said violence had \"increased markedly\" since a previous inspection in 2022.It also said the prison's \"infrastructure was in a poor state\", citing \"repeated breakdowns of essential equipment\" and \"some significant elements of the prison's perimeter security systems\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmily McGarveyWatch: Ms Wallace, who spent four years writing the book with Ms Giuffre, spoke on her behalfPrince Andrew should share everything he knows about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the co-writer of Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir has told the BBC. The book, Nobody's Girl, officially released in the UK on Tuesday, gives more details of Ms Giuffre's allegations about Prince Andrew - which he has always denied.Ahead of the release, co-author Amy Wallace told BBC Newsnight there was a period when Prince Andrew \"indicated he was willing to help investigators in the US\" but he was \"never available, for some reason\".\"That's something he could still do,\" Ms Wallace - who spent four years writing the book with Ms Giuffre - added.Ms Wallace said: \"He could say, as he has repeatedly, 'I still deny that I was involved... however, I was in these houses and I was on that island and I was on the jet and I saw things, and I know how much these women have suffered and I would like to share what I saw'.\"Senior politicians - including government minister Peter Kyle - also said on Tuesday that Prince Andrew should speak to US authorities about Epstein's crimes.In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Andrew should give evidence to US authorities \"about what he knew and what his involvement was\" in the Epstein scandal.Ms Giuffre - who took her own life earlier this year - says in her book that she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, which he denies.She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\" with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, announced on Friday that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.But there are still calls for them to be formally removed.Ms Wallace said: \"I can speak for Virginia; I know that she would view it as a victory that he was forced, by whatever means, to voluntarily give them up.\"She called it a \"symbolic gesture\" which has made \"modern history in terms of the royal era\", describing it as \"a step in the right direction\".\"Virginia wanted all the men who she had been trafficked to, against her will, to be held to account, and this is just one of the men.\"Even though he [Andrew] continues to deny it, his life is being eroded because of his past behaviour, as it should be,\" Ms Wallace said.Getty ImagesMs Wallace said the private jets used by Epstein \"had been remodelled in order to afford many bedrooms - they were designed as flying trafficking agents, they were there to use girls in\".She added: \"Prince Andrew was on at least one of those jets that I know of, if not more.\"He has to take sort of the measure of his own moral compass - he said in his settlement with Virginia that he now acknowledges the pain that these women and young girls had suffered. If you really feel it, do something about it.\"Speaking about Ms Giuffre, Ms Wallace said: \"I'm sad and I'm honoured to be able to speak at least a little bit on her behalf to stand up for her. \"She wrote this book to try to help other people, to make the world a better place. \"She deserves all credit for whatever role she played in forcing Prince Andrew to relinquish a few more of his titles but she deserves all credit even more than that for being brave enough to stand up to say 'this isn't right'.\"The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of sex-trafficking offences.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.Cabinet minister Kyle said that the victims must be put first and at the centre of further discussions.\"I think anybody that has any information that could bring justice and information to victims of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes should be fully engaging with any of the authorities that are seeking to deliver that information and justice for the victims,\" Kyle told ITV's Good Morning Britain.\"So of course, anybody, anywhere that has information that can deliver that justice should be sharing it openly.\"I believe that Andrew, in the past, has said that he would co-operate, and I urge him to stick to his word on that.\"Conservative MP Jenrick also said Prince Andrew should \"leave public life forever\" and \"lead an entirely private life\".\"He has to make his own decisions as to what he feels he should do, but I think that he has behaved disgracefully,\" Jenrick told the BBC.\"The public are sick of Prince Andrew and the damage that he's done to the reputation of our Royal Family and this country.\"",

Andy Fletcher, chief executive of the charity, said: \"What we see overall is that people are waiting longer for appointments and struggling to access things like wheelchairs and home adaptations.\"What people like Tom and Charlotte really need is that holistic support to help them live well and stay healthy for longer.\"A spokesperson for the ICB said: \"We're sorry to hear that Tom and Charlotte are unhappy about some aspects of their care and will work with them to review the type of support they receive and how it could be changed to suit their needs.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoHarry Sekulich andGabriela PomeroyCharlotte Chess CenterDaniel Naroditsky, also known to his online fans as 'Danya', died two weeks out from his 30th birthdayUS chess grandmaster and online commentator Daniel Naroditsky has died aged 29.The popular chess player's family announced his \"unexpected\" death in a statement released by his club, the Charlotte Chess Center, on Monday. No cause of death was given.\"It is with great sadness that we share the unexpected passing of Daniel Naroditsky,\" the statement said. \"Daniel was a talented chess player, commentator and educator, and a cherished member of the chess community, admired and respected by fans and players around the world.\"The US and International chess federations have paid tribute to Naroditsky, along with other professional players.American world number two Hikaru Nakamura said he was \"devastated\" at the news.\"This is a massive loss for the world of chess,\" Nakamura said in a social media post.As well as competing in high-level events, Naroditsky ran a chess YouTube channel, with nearly 500,000 subscribers. His Twitch stream drummed up 340,000 followers, with hundreds of thousands of viewers drawn to his regular video tutorials and livestreams against competitors. Fans praised his insight and passion, casually referring to him as 'Danya'.He played a \"pivotal role in popularising chess content online,\" the International Chess Federation said. Naroditsky first took an interest in chess at the age of six, when his older brother Alan introduced him to the game to help entertain a group of children at a birthday party.His father Vladimir and multiple coaches soon noticed his talents.\"As far as I was concerned, I was just playing games with my brother,\" Naroditsky told the New York Times in a 2022 interview.Getty ImagesNaroditsky in 2008, following his World Youth Championship victory in TurkeyHe gained international attention in 2007 when he won the under-12 boys world youth championship in Antalya, Turkey. In 2010, at the age of 14, he became one of the youngest ever published chess authors when he wrote a book titled Mastering Positional Chess, covering practical skills and technical manoeuvrings.In 2013 Naroditsky won the US Junior Championship, helping him earn the title of grandmaster, the international chess federation's highest-ranked chess competitor, while he was still a teenager.Naroditsky later graduated from Stanford University and worked as a chess coach in Charlotte, North Carolina.In 2022 the New York Times named Naroditsky as its \"new chess columnist\" and invited him to contribute to a series of chess puzzles for the newspaper's games section.In the publication's accompanying interview, the young grandmaster mused on chess's influence in his life.\"Even at my level, I can still discover beautiful things about the game every single time I train, teach, play or am a commentator at a tournament,\" he said.Nemo Zhou –  a Toronto-based Woman Chess Grandmaster (WGM) and chess content creator – told the BBC Naroditsky was a friend and an \"inspiration.\"Zhou played chess with him, both in person and virtually at chess events across the US.He was \"everything that the combination of chess and content creation was supposed to be – he had this way to make chess fun\", she said. She added that he was known for being a \"true historian of the game\" who had a great memory for chess facts and historical games, and \"did everything with kindness.\"\"Without people like him I probably would have quit chess at 17 and never touched it again,\" she said.

    "body": "Just nowEmer Moreau andEsyllt CarrBusiness reportersChancellor Rachel Reeves has said she plans to scrap \"needless form filling\" in a bid to boost business growth.Speaking at a regional investment summit in Birmingham, the chancellor said the reforms would boost growth and \"make the UK a top destination for global capital\".Ahead of the Budget next month, Reeves acknowledged that \"for too many people\" the economy was \"not working as it should\".The government has been criticised by firms who say increased employers' National Insurance contributions and the Employment Rights Bill add to the burdens facing businesses.The chancellor said the changes will save firms almost £6bn a year by the end of the parliamentary term.The measures include plans to reform the company merger process. New \"simpler corporate rules\" will remove requirements for small businesses to submit lengthy reports to Companies House, the Treasury said.The changes will apply to over 100,000 firms such as family-run cafes.Earlier on Tuesday, Business Secretary Peter Kyle defended Labour's approach to business, telling the BBC the government would implement changes in a way that is \"pro-worker and pro-business\".The measures could include temporary exemptions for new AI software from regulation, Kyle told the Today programme.\"In certain circumstances when new AI technology is being developed, we can remove it from all regulation for a period of time to give it the space to really grow, to develop, to be commercialised really rapidly,\" he said.This, he said, would enable the tech to be used \"to benefit the health, the wealth, the education of our nations\".\"We'll use that in a very targeted, a very safe way.\"The government has pledged to reduce the administrative cost of regulation by a quarter by the end of this Parliament.Kyle said the previous government \"did not do enough on deregulation\" despite pledging to do so, particularly after Brexit.\"If you look at some of the reporting that needs to be done by directors, for example, directors' reports to Companies House, I'm eliminating a great deal of that today because some of it is just so unnecessary,\" he said.But pushed on whether the government's changes to employment rights would add costs to businesses, Kyle insisted that the changes would be fair for both employers and employees.\"We are making sure that the rights and responsibilities that people have in the workplace as employers and as employees [are] right for the age we're living in.\"Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the plans would be welcomed by businesses.\"The burden of unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy ramps up their costs and damages competitiveness,\" she said.Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said Tuesday's announcement will \"ring hollow\" if the chancellor raises taxes for employers in next month's budget.\"The true test of whether Rachel Reeves will deliver for business will be at the Budget – small firms and entrepreneurs have heard these warm words on regulation before.\"The burden of compliance – in terms of money, time, and stress – weighs heavily on small firms, and cutting it needs to be a project undertaken by every part of the government.\"But the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper said: \"If the chancellor was serious about cutting red tape she would tackle the mind-blowing two billion extra pieces of business paperwork created by Brexit by pursuing an ambitious tailor-made UK-EU customs union.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporter, BBC NewsBBCThe Pizza Hut at Hull, which is among the 68 restaurants that will be shutThe locations of the Pizza Hut restaurants and delivery sites to close across the UK has been revealed.Some 1,210 people will be made redundant as 68 restaurants in places including Brighton, Hull, Bristol, Leeds and Edinburgh shut their doors in the coming weeks.Eleven delivery outlets will also close as part of the administration.Administrators were appointed  to DC London Pie Limited, which operates Pizza Hut's UK restaurants on Monday, while the global brand owner Yum! Brands stepped in to save the remaining 64 pizza restaurants and 1,276 jobs.Pizza Hut is well-known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.Administrators FTI Consulting said DC London Pie had been hit by the combination of \"challenging trading conditions and increased costs\". Cashflow had come under pressure \"as a result of tax-related obligations\".\"The joint administrators will continue to work with employees who have unfortunately been made redundant, to ensure they get the support needed,\" joint administrator Matt Callaghan said in a statement on Tuesday.DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year.

    "body": "Stunning Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight in moonless skyImage source, Getty ImagesByShireen Jordan BBC Weather and Simon King Lead Weather PresenterUpdated 2 hours agoWith some clear skies on Tuesday night you might have your best chance of seeing the annual Orionids meteor shower.Taking place 60 miles up in space, it can often be one of the most impressive displays of the celestial calendar. The meteors are known for being bright and fast, peaking for about seven days around the 22 October.You may also get a chance to see either the Lemmon or SWAN comets, external as they also pass close to Earth.What are the Orionids?Image source, Chris HornbyImage caption, Meteors are often referred to as shooting starsThe Orionids are fast-moving meteors travelling at a speed of around 41 miles per second.They have long streaks of light and originate from the well- known Halley's Comet as it follows its orbit around the Sun. The comet itself only passes by Earth roughly every 75 years, with the next date expected to be the summer of 2061.As Earth passes through debris left by the comet, tiny particles the size of a grain of sand burn up in our atmosphere and leave a streak of light through the sky.  They can appear faint but they leave a distinctive light trail. Larger meteors will produce bright trails. Sometimes meteors can even appear brighter than the planet Venus – these are called fireballs, external.You might also have the chance to see either comet Lemmon or SWAN.Comet SWAN takes 22,554 years to orbit the Sun and Lemmon 1,350 years but both are at their closest orbit to Earth on Tuesday.How can I watch the Orionids?Image source, CFOTOImage caption, You should be able to see the shower for several days on either side of the peak date, if weather conditions allowThe radiant is the point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, and for the Orionids this is the constellation of Orion.Orion rises in the east after midnight, just to the north of its red-tinged star Betelgeuse. To track down Orion, external, look out for a line of three bright stars, close together, known as Orion's Belt.The quality of the display is measured by how many meteors are visible every hour - known as the zenithal hourly rate. There could be around 15 meteors an hour during the peak of the Orionids around the 22 October travelling at speeds of 148,000mph (238,000km/h).For the best viewing conditions, find a dark spot, away from city lights after midnight with an unobstructed wide, open sky. Let your eyes adjust to the dark and look towards the constellation of Orion. You will not need binoculars or a telescope as the shower will be visible to the naked eye.Will the skies be clear?The weather has turned increasingly unsettled this week, with cloud and rain interspersed with clearer intervals and misty conditions.  However, cloud and showers on Tuesday will clear through the evening and so there should be plenty of clear skies across the UK.The lack of moonlight due to a new Moon will help your chance of spotting some meteors.While meteor activity will then start to decrease, there will still be a good opportunity to catch some shooting stars - meteors - in Scotland on Wednesday night.But otherwise elsewhere across the UK, cloud and rain will spread northward and obstruct any view of the night sky.By the end of the week, clearer and colder conditions are expected to develop, with better night-sky viewing prospects towards the later stages of the Orionids. And, if you miss the peak, the display continues until 7 November. Keep across your local forecast on the BBC Weather website or app.",

    "body": "3 hours agoShaimaa KhalilJapan correspondent andYvette TanSingaporeThe moment Sanae Takaichi wins Japan's lower houseSanae Takaichi has been elected Japan's prime minister by parliament, making her the first woman to hold the office.The 64-year-old won a clear majority on Tuesday - 237 votes in the powerful Lower House and another 125 in the Upper House - as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).A staunch conservative and admirer of the late former British PM Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi takes over at a challenging economic moment as Japan grapples with rising cost-of-living and a frustrated public.   It's also been an uncertain time for the world's fourth-largest economy. She is the fourth PM in just five years, after her predecessors' terms were cut short by plunging ratings and scandals.Although she defeated four men to win the LDP race in early October, her path to the top job appeared to be blocked when the LDP's long-time coalition partner, the Komeito party, withdrew support. But a last-minute deal with another opposition party - the right- leaning Japan Innovation Party (JIP), known as Ishin - saved her. She and the LDP will face voters next in 2028.Meanwhile aside from domestic challenges, she faces tricky relationships abroad. South Korea, which had started to mend historically delicate ties with Japan, is wary because of her right-wing politics, which lean nationalist. And, like some of her predecessors, including the late former PM Shinzo Abe, she is seen as hawkish when it comes to an increasingly powerful China. But the most important relationship is with the US and a test is around the corner - a meeting with US President Donald Trump next week.While both sides have reached a tariff deal, Trump's past comments questioning the value of a security treaty between them and demanding Tokyo pay more for defence have raised concerns - Takaichi must navigate these alongside an unpredictable US administration.  Getty ImagesTakaichi is known for her deeply conservative viewsAt the age of 64, Takaichi is no stranger to Japanese politics. A known ally of Abe, she has held several ministerial roles over her career and has run for the PM job before.She was elected LDP leader after former PM and LDP leader Shigeru Ishiba resigned following major losses in midterm elections.Nicknamed the \"Iron Lady\" for her admiration of Thatcher, Takaichi is known for conservative views, including her opposition to same-sex marriage and a growing demand to allow married women to keep their maiden surnames. This has made some young women sceptical of the significance of her win. \"Everyone's like, 'Wow, she's the first female prime minister in Japanese history and that's a great opportunity for women's empowerment',\" said 21-year-old student Ayda Ogura.\"[But] if you look into her political beliefs and what she stands for, you realise that some of the things are very traditional. Instead of creating structural change, she rather perpetuates the patriarchal system.\"During her recent campaign she proposed expanded hospital services for women's health and giving household support workers greater recognition. She still has a major task ahead of her - to rebuild the trust of the public in the LDP.The party has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, but under Ishiba it lost its majority in the lower house for the first time in 15 years. Then it lost its majority in the upper house in July, amid public anger after a fundraising scandal.In electing Takaichi, the LDP had hoped to win back conservative voters, many of whom had gravitated towards the far-right Sanseito party after being disillusioned with the usual options. But first Takaichi has to turn her attention to public anger as prices continue to soar. An ongoing rice shortage, for example, has resulted in record prices for the Japanese staple.  Local media are reporting that she may apppoint Satsuki Katayama as finance minister, yet another historic first for a woman. Like Takaichi, Katayama too is a protege of Abe.  While concerns over Japan's rising debt and lacklustre growth have been worrying investors, Takaichi's win seemed to have offered some optimism for the markets. ",

    "body": "'It's harder to be a parent than a space shuttle commander', trailblazing Nasa pilot tells BBC10 hours agoRebecca MorelleScience Editor andAlison FrancisSenior Science JournalistTony Jolliffe/ BBC NewsFrom a very young age, Eileen Collins wanted to be an astronaut She's the astronaut who smashed through the glass ceiling. And kept on going.Eileen Collins made history as the first woman to pilot and command a Nasa spacecraft - but despite her remarkable achievements, not everyone will know her name.Now a feature-length documentary called Spacewoman, which chronicles her trailblazing career, looks set to change that.We meet Collins at London's Science Museum. She's softly spoken, warm and very down to earth - but you quickly get a sense of her focus and determination. She clearly has inner steel.\"I was reading a magazine article on the Gemini astronauts. I was probably nine years old, and I thought that's the coolest thing. That's what I want to do,\" she says.\"Of course, there were no women astronauts back then. But I just thought, I'll be a lady astronaut.\"NASANasa's Space Shuttle programme flew for three decades But that little girl set her sights even higher - she wanted to be at the controls of a spacecraft.And the only way to achieve this was to join the military and become a test pilot.In the Air Force, she stood out from the crowd and was selected to join the astronaut programme. She was to fly Space Shuttles - Nasa's reusable \"space planes\".She knew the eyes of the world were on her when her first mission launched in 1995.\"As the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle, I worked very hard at that because I didn't want people to say, 'Oh look, the woman has made a mistake'. Because it wasn't just about me, it was about the women to follow me,\" she says.\"And I wanted there to be a reputation for women pilots that was: 'Hey, they're really good'.\"Eileen CollinsEileen Collins with her young daughter BridgetShe was so good in fact that she was soon promoted to commander, in another first.Collins was also a parent to two young children. The fact that she was a working wife and mother was frequently brought up in press conferences at the time, with some journalists seemingly astonished that she could be both.But Collins says being a mum and a commander were \"the two best jobs in the world\".\"But I'm going to tell you it is harder to be a parent than to be a space shuttle commander,\" she laughs.\"The best training I ever had for being a commander was being a parent - because you have to learn how to say no to people.\"NASAA huge investigation was launched after the Columbia disaster Nasa's Space Shuttles, which flew for three decades, reached breathtaking highs, but also some terrible lows.In 1986, the Challenger spacecraft suffered a catastrophic failure seconds after launching, killing all seven crew members on board.And in 2003, the Columbia shuttle broke up in the skies over Texas at the end of its mission, killing its crew of seven as well.A piece of insulating foam on Columbia's fuel tank broke loose during launch, damaging the heat shield with devastating results.Columbia was unable to withstand the fiery re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, disintegrating as the world watched on in horror.Collins shakes her head at the memory of the disaster, and of the friends whose lives were lost.But with her job as commander, she had to pick up the mantle - she was to be in charge of the shuttle's following flight.Did she think about quitting at that point?\"People throughout the shuttle programme were counting on the commander to stick with it,\" she says quietly.\"I think quitting the mission would have been the opposite of brave… and I wanted to be a brave leader. I wanted to be a confident leader. I wanted to instill that confidence in other people.\"But when her mission finally took to the skies in 2005, the nightmare scenario happened again. A chunk of foam broke away during launch.This time, though, there was a plan in place to check the damage. But it meant undertaking one of the riskiest maneuvers in space history.Collins had to pilot the shuttle through a 360 degree flip while flying beneath the International Space Station. It allowed colleagues on the orbiting lab to photograph the craft's underside and check if the heatshield had been breached.\"There were engineers and managers saying it couldn't be done, all these reasons why it was too dangerous,\" she says.\"I listened to the discussion, they knew I was the commander, and I said: 'It sounds like we can do it'.\"NASACollins remained cool and calm under pressure With her hands steady at the controls, her voice calm as she spoke to mission control, Collins piloted the craft through a slow, graceful somersault. With the shuttle's underside now visible, the damage was quickly spotted - and a spacewalk was carried out to repair it.It meant Collins and her crew would make it safely home.This was Collins's last flight. She tells us that she always planned to stop after her fourth mission - to give others a chance to go to space.And she's watched plenty of astronauts follow in her footsteps. Does she have any advice for the next generation dreaming of the stars?\"Do your homework, listen to your teacher, pay attention in class and read books, and that will give you something to focus on,\" she says in a matter-of-fact way.Those who follow Collins to space will learn just how much she achieved, not only as a woman, but as a formidable pilot and commander.She says she has no regrets about bringing her astronaut career to an end. She made her decision and didn't look back. But there's still a wistful look in her eye when we ask if she'd be tempted if a seat on a spacecraft became free.\"Yes, I would love to go on a mission someday. When I'm an old lady, maybe I'll get a chance to go back in space.\"Spacewoman is in selected cinemas now. ",

The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry SekulichEPAChris Minns, Premier of New South Wales, has pushed for tougher hate speech laws following the Bondi attacksThe Australian state where the Bondi shooting occurred plans to ban the phrase \"globalise the intifada\" as part of a crackdown on \"hateful\" slogans.New South Wales (NSW) premier Chris Minns has also called for a Royal Commission into the Bondi attack, marking the deadliest shooting in Australia in nearly 30 years.Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured last Sunday when two gunmen, believed to have been motivated by \"Islamic State ideology\", opened fire on a Jewish festival at the country's most iconic beach.Australia's state and federal governments have announced a raft of measures to counter extremism since the attack.Minns plans to recall the state parliament next week to pass through stricter hate speech and gun restrictions. Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage \"a summer of calm\".The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant \"globalise the intifada\" as hate speech. Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.Through the week, Bondi's surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the heroes of the shooting. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme \"light over darkness\" marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute's silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.\"Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,\" prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.\"It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.\"Bondi's attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent An appeal for information has been sent to all MI5 staff over false evidence the service gave to three courts in a neo-Nazi spy case.MI5's regulator is investigating how it came to make false claims about conversations with the BBC.The Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson, who is overseeing the inquiry, said it was \"surprising\" that new material was being uncovered years after the case began.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ordered the investigation in September after the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts.The prime minister's demand followed requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened. MI5 also gave false evidence to its regulator, Sir Brian Leveson himself, whose office is conducting this new investigation.The case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X, who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.Sir Brian has now sent a letter updating the prime minister, the attorney general and the home secretary on the investigation into the false evidence. In the letter, he reveals the investigation team \"asked that a message be disseminated to all current MI5 staff\", inviting anyone who believes they have information which may assist, to make contact. He adds: \"I am grateful for MI5's prompt and constructive engagement to achieve this.\"But he also notes that \"relevant material\" continues to be identified, adding that it is \"surprising\" four years after the case began and \"over three years after my inspectors first considered the Agent X case.\"Earlier this month, MI5 was heavily criticised by the police investigation into the state agent Stakeknife for only disclosing crucial documents years after that inquiry began. The investigation into the false evidence in the Agent X case is being led by Sir John Goldring, the Deputy Investigatory Powers Commissioner.In the update letter, it is revealed that Sir John and his investigators have interviewed 36 people over the past five weeks, including \"current and former staff of the intelligence services\", as well as BBC staff, government lawyers, and barristers representing MI5.The new investigation is said to have identified \"additional lines of inquiry\" after obtaining material beyond that which was disclosed in the three court cases. The investigation report is not expected to be completed before March.In February this year, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation. Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.In fact, MI5 had disclosed Agent X's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate him. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.Following the BBC's revelations, MI5's Director General Sir Ken McCallum issued an \"unreserved apology\" for the false evidence.Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.But, in July, a panel of senior high court judges ruled that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\".They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.Sir Ken previously said the service would co-operate fully with the new inquiry.",

One traveller posted on X: \"Horrible experience at Port of Dover this morning. Absolute chaos. \"Traffic at a standstill for an hour. Worst start to holiday imaginable. Just missed our boat. Still stuck. Kids in car.\"One local resident told the BBC the town was \"proper rammed\". 'Christmas shopping'The port advised passengers not to arrive more than two hours before their sailing. It said if customers do miss their scheduled sailing due to the wait times, their ferry operator will place them on the next available crossing.Long queues have been seen on the roads leading into Dover.A port spokesperson asked all port-bound traffic to remain on main roads \"to allow the Dover community to travel to festive events and finish their Christmas shopping in the town\".Eurotunnel said it had a waiting time of 60 minutes for freight and 30 minutes for cars at its Folkestone terminal due to \"high demand\".Meanwhile, public transport operators are experiencing problems reaching the port.Bus company Stagecoach said in a statement: \"Due to heavy traffic at the docks the service will be unable to serve Eastern Docks at the moment.\"More on this story",

    "body": "51 minutes agoPaul Glynn,Culture reporterandIan Youngs,Culture reporterBest-selling children's author and comedian David Walliams has denied allegations of inappropriate behaviour after being dropped by his publisher HarperCollins UK.A spokesperson for HarperCollins said it had decided not to release any new titles by Walliams \"after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO\".The Telegraph says it follows an investigation into allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. HarperCollins did not confirm the reasons for its decision.A spokesperson for Walliams said he had \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher.\"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice,\" the spokesperson added.The publisher said it took employee wellbeing \"extremely seriously\" with \"processes in place for reporting and investigating concerns\". \"To respect the privacy of individuals we do not comment on internal matters,\" the company said.Walliams is one of the UK's most successful children's authors, having sold more than 60 million copies worldwide in 55 languages.HarperCollins published his first children's book, The Boy in the Dress, in 2008. Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.Two of his books - Mr Stink and The Boy in the Dress - have been adapted into TV films, which are scheduled to be broadcast on CBBC on Sunday.Walliams is also scheduled to appear on comedy panel show Would I Lie to You? on Boxing Day.A spokesperson for the BBC said: \"While we're not making any changes to the festive schedules, we have no future projects directly involving David Walliams.\"Walliams first rose to fame on TV sketch series Little Britain and has also won National Television Awards for his work as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.He was made an OBE in 2017 for his services to charity and the arts.But he has faced controversies including being criticised after appearing to make two Nazi salutes during a recording of BBC comedy panel show Would I Lie To You? this summer.In 2022, he apologised and admitted making \"disrespectful comments\" about two Britain's Got Talent contestants during a break in filming.He left the programme that year and sued the production company over the leaking of the remarks, reaching a settlement with them in 2023. HarperCollins UK appointed Kate Elton as its new chief executive in October.",

    "body": "2 hours agoCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the sentencing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan has previously been acquitted in a separate Toshakhana case.The former leader still has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\".",

    "body": "13 hours agoHafsa KhalilandIan Youngs,Culture reporterTimothée Chalamet has finally quashed rumours that he is cult anonymous rapper EsDeeKid - by performing alongside him in a new video.Speculation has run riot that the Oscar-nominated US actor has been leading a double life as the masked rapper, who only ever reveals his eyes.Some followers spotted an apparent resemblance with Chalamet's eyes, and when the BBC questioned the star about the connection earlier this week, he responded: \"No comment... You'll see, all in due time.\"Now, the actor - who adopted the hip-hop moniker Lil Timmy Tim in high school - has scotched the conspiracies by posting a video of himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the musician's top 40 hit 4Raws.In the music video, Chalamet appeared to refer to the rumours by starting with only his eyes on show, like the drill artist, before pulling down the bandana from his face and dropping the bars: \"It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million.\"He then referenced his partner Kylie Jenner with the line: \"Girl got $1 billion.\"The clip was filmed at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, and was reposted by EsDeeKid.The speculation has been seized upon by fans in recent weeks, and both sides stayed silent as EsDeeKid reached the UK top 10 and Chalamet promoted his new film.BBC Radio One's Greg James also quizzed Chalamet in an interview this week about his connection to EsDeeKid, where he responded: \"All will be revealed in due time.\" James updated his caption on social media overnight noting \"all was revealed\". Chalamet even gave his movie, Marty Supreme, several shout-outs in the new collaboration, building on an already savvy marketing campaign for the film.But it was always far-fetched that the two people could be one and the same, and that Chalamet could have pulled off rapping with EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.Their collaboration quickly went viral, with British rapper Central Cee replying \"Naaa\" with crying and laughing emojis, Tinie Tempah posting \"Hahha this is sickkk\" and US star Shaboozey declaring \"This going #1\".

    "body": "An army barracks in Kent which has been used to house asylum seekers has closed, according to the Home Office.Napier Barracks in Folkestone - a former military site - opened as accommodation for migrants in 2020.It faced criticism over poor living conditions, particularly during the pandemic when there was a large outbreak of Covid. The site closed on Friday and will be handed over to a property developer for housing.The Home Office said it planned to completely vacate the site by the end of the month to hand it back to the Ministry of Defence, ahead of a transfer in March to a housing developer that purchased the site.It said it did not comment on individual asylum accommodation sites or on operational arrangements around those sites.However, it said the government would close every asylum hotel.The government had previously announced discussions had begun to use barracks in Crowborough in East Sussex and Inverness in Scotland to house about 900 male asylum seekers in total.Napier Barracks housed more than 300 asylum seekers at its peak, but was believed to have fewer than 100 residents ahead of its closure.The 130-year-old military site was hit by the allegations of poor conditions following numerous inspections since February 2021.The charity Care4Calais said it completed its final clothing distribution at the barracks on Sunday.A spokesperson said: \"We were never allowed indoors, so we worked outside in all weathers. \"It was not how we wanted to work, but our volunteers did it with care, dignity, and determination.\"",

But it is all worth it for our Hazlitt audience.\"Mr Wood said he was armed with nothing but Dame Sherie Trifle's recipe book, filled with his lines, an outrageous wardrobe and a performance degree from Canterbury Christ Church University.\"I did train to be a performer when I was at university, but I wasn't expecting my stage debut to be in a dress,\" he said.The senior technician ended up starring in all of the theatre's weekend performances of Dick Whittington & His Cat.Dan BaughPantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill and was unable to perform at the Hazlitt Theatre in MaidstoneAudience member Rachel Gadd said: \"As someone who has seen a fair few pantomimes in their day, I can safely say this was the best show I've seen.\"Of course, the show was fabulous on its own, but with the wonderful James standing in, it really added another layer of charm. \"I think the act of stepping up and helping people out is really what Christmas is all about.\"Director and producer Martin Cleverley, on behalf of Parkwood Theatres, added: \"In over a decade of producing panto, the Hazlitt has never seen their light operator step in for the panto dame.\"2026 will see a new special clause that sees all technical staff add panto understudy to their job role.\"Professional dancer Brad Wright also stepped in for Jared Leathwood in the title role of Dick Whittington that night, while fellow professional dancer Luke Baugh stepped in for Emmanuel Duarte as Idle Jack earlier in the run.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "The widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has said the Turning Point USA organisation he founded will help elect JD Vance as president in 2028, despite the current US vice-president having yet to announce he is running.Erika Kirk's endorsement on Thursday came on the opening day of Turning Point's annual America Fest conference, the organisation's largest gathering since her husband was shot dead in September.\"We are going to get my husband's friend, JD Vance, elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,\" Kirk said, referring to the 48th president. Trump is the 47th.Vance, meanwhile, is scheduled to speak at the event on Sunday.Turning Point has been credited with helping Republican President Donald Trump expand his coalition of support, leading to his 2024 presidential election victory.Her announcement ahead of Trump's one-year mark in office signals early jockeying to be his successor ahead of the 2028 election.After Kirk gave her opening remarks, the stage at the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona turned into a political mudslinging contest as tensions within the conservative movement were laid bare.Podcaster Ben Shapiro lobbed attacks at media rivals Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon, calling them \"fraudsters and grifters\".  \"The people who refused to condemn Candace's truly vicious attacks - and some of them are speaking here tonight - are guilty of cowardice,\" Shapiro said.Owens, a former Turning Point employee who hosts a popular podcast, has been a thorn in Republicans' side and pushed various conspiracy theories, including baseless suggestions about Charlie Kirk's murder. It comes at a time when there has been growing speculation about Trump's hold on the Republican party and infighting among factions of the president's supporters about the future of the Maga movement.Shapiro also criticised former Fox News host Carlson for interviewing Nick Fuentes, a far-right political commentator and Holocaust denier, on his podcast in late October, drawing widespread condemnation. After Shapiro, Carlson took the stage and shot back at Shapiro.\"That guy is pompous,\" Carlson said. \"Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That's hilarious.\"  Charlie Kirk's Turning Point events were known for addressing controversial and divisive topics. Supporters saw it as necessary for free speech. Critics saw it as hate-mongering. Authorities said Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin - Tyler Robinson - told his romantic partner that he killed Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". Erika Kirk told the Turning Point conference: \"You won't agree with everyone on this stage this weekend. And that's okay. Welcome to America.\"Since the assassination, she said, \"we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt\". Trump has recently encountered a series of setbacks within his Republican party, including a public falling out with his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene and the impending release of the Epstein files, which a majority of Republicans voted for despite Trump's initial discouragement.The four-day America Fest conference was scheduled to continue through the weekend, with Vance and Donald Trump Jr scheduled as guest speakers on Sunday.

    "body": "12 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoJaroslav LukivUS President Donald Trump: \"We hit every site flawlessly\"The US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom – which directs American military operations in the Middle East, north-east Africa, central and southern Asia – said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), told news agency AFP that \"at least five members of the Islamic State group were killed\" in eastern Syria's Deir ez Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency, announced the Royal Jordanian Air Force had participated in the strikes to \"prevent extremist groups\" from \"threaten[ing] the security of Syria's neighbours and the wider region\".IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to immediately verify the targets.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.ReutersA US airman attaches a munitions system to an F-15 fighter jet taking part in Operation Hawkeye StrikeIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "11 hours agoRitu AgarwalLucknowMaroof CulmenBiryani in Lucknow is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with doughMouth-watering kebabs, fragrant biryani and whipped cloud-like desserts.The northern Indian city of Lucknow has always been a food lovers' paradise, with locals and visitors swearing by its cuisine.Last month, Unesco recognised it as a Creative City of Gastronomy - adding it to a select list of global cities and kindling hopes that it will spotlight Lucknow's sublime food. With this designation, it joins a global network of 408 cities across more than 100 countries committed to promoting \"creativity as a driver of sustainable urban development\".The recognition \"is a testament to its deep-rooted culinary traditions and vibrant food ecosystem\", Tim Curtis, director and representative, Unesco Regional Office for South Asia, said.\"It honours the city's rich cultural legacy while opening new avenues for international collaboration,\" he added.Lucknow is only the second Indian city - after Hyderabad which was selected in 2019 - to find a place in this coveted list of 70 cities globally.The accolade for my home city doesn't surprise residents or food lovers - many echo celebrity chef Ranveer Brar's take: \"Better late than never. It should have come before.\"With the Unesco recognition, my beloved, chaotic, eclectic city - the capital of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh - is finally in the spotlight for what has always defined its soul: a passion for food.Madhavi Kuckreja, founder of Sanatkada Trust which is spearheading a project on the Kitchens of Lucknow, told the BBC that what gives the city's food its distinct flavour is the slow pace and the time taken to cook a dish.\"'What will be cooked, how will it be cooked?' is a continued conversation from waking up until going to bed in most homes. And you are actually judged by the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen,\" she says.But this focus on food is not new and many of the dishes that have come to define the city's cuisine have been around for hundreds of years.Maroof CulmenLucknow is famous for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabsThe City of Nawabs - as it's popularly called after its 18th and 19th Century wealthy Muslim rulers - is known for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabs and a distinctive take on biryani that were created, evolved and taken to sublime levels in their kitchens.These royal kitchens were centres of culinary innovations, blending the Persian and local Indian styles to create what became the cuisine of Awadh - as the region was then called.It was during this time that Lucknow's most famous kebabs were fashioned. The story goes that the mutton galouti kebabs that have defined the city amongst visitors were created to feed an ageing nawab who had lost his teeth. His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list. Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.Maroof CulmenThe city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winterThe local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad. Nearly 150 years after it was set up in 1880, the place is still much sought-after for its hot kachoris (fried bread stuffed with lentils) and jalebis (crispy sweet made of deep-fried fermented batter and soaked in sugar syrup).Its sixth-generation owners - father Anmol Agarwal and sons Anoop and Pranshu - continue to safeguard the process and craftsmanship behind every recipe. An automobile engineer by education, Pranshu is passionate about his legacy. \"This runs in my blood. There is nothing else I would rather do,\" he says.Getty ImagesThe Sharmaji Tea Stall is famous for its milky masala chaiThe city also offers unique seasonal delights, such as makkhan malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter. The process of making it is scientific and complicated. The cook hand-churns the milk and then leaves it out at night, exposed to the dew that gives it its incredible frothy texture.On cold mornings, street vendors can be seen lined up in old city areas like Aminabad and Chowk. Many, however, say that their children do not want to learn the art.Chef Brar, who is also from Lucknow and has been an unequivocal advocate for its food, has often said that the city's rich food legacy places it right on top of the pile of the Indian street food experience. But the real value from the Unesco recognition, he says, will occur only if Lucknow can now create awareness about its lesser-known eateries.Ms Kukreja says every dish in Lucknow tells a story - shaped by generational food businesses, from humble street carts to bustling restaurants, and guarded family recipes.The international acclaim, she hopes, will encourage more people around the world to learn these stories and visit the city to savour the culinary delights of Lucknow.",

The Chair of the BBC, Samir Shah said “the BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement”.\nThe BBC has been given a Friday deadline by Trump to respond or face possible legal action, with the US president threatening to sue the corporation for a billion dollars.   \nAnthony and Marianna speak to Elie Honig, CNN’s Senior Legal Analyst who assesses the likelihood of the case ending up in court, and how any damages could be calculated. We also look at whether any of Trump’s previous legal actions against other media outlets can predict how this dispute may play out.\nPlus, newly released emails between Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein from 2011 allege that Donald Trump 'spent hours' with one of Epstein’s victims. The documents have been published by House Democrats and refer to the president as the \"dog that hasn't barked.” Donald Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has accused Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.”\nAnthony and Marianna unpack what this means for the administration and whether it could affect the president’s approval ratings.\nHOSTS:\n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Elie Honig, Senior Legal Analyst at CNN\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "A police motorcyclist who crashed into a pensioner while escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh through London has been found not guilty of causing death by careless driving.Helen Holland, 81, died two weeks after she was hit in the crash on West Cromwell Road, west London, on 10 May 2023.The Old Bailey was told PC Christopher Harrison, 68, had been riding at between 44mph (70km/h) and 58mph within a 30mph speed limit, on the approach to a red light where Mrs Holland was crossing.PC Harrison told the Old Bailey he \"did not see her in the footway at all on the approach\".The outrider team is allowed to exceed the speed limit, go through red lights and drive on the wrong side of the road, but such driving must be done safely, the court heard.After the verdict was returned, a person shouted from the public gallery: \"You ruined our family with no consequences.\"Mr Justice Martin Chamberlain then told PC Harrison he was free to leave.On the day of the incident, PC Harrison was among a team of convoy motorbike outriders escorting the Duchess of Edinburgh as she left the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office in King Charles Street, just after 15:00BST,  jurors were told.The car that the duchess was in and a police back-up vehicle were part of the convoy.The defendant, who had 21 years of experience in the specialist escort group, said he \"couldn't put it into numbers\" how many times he had undertaken the journey and that he was \"very familiar\" with the route.Mrs Holland was 2.9m on to the crossing when PC Harrison's motorbike hit her, the court heard.She suffered a skull fracture, bruising to her arms, legs and body, as well as fractures to her lower legs.A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as complications from a severe head injury.PC Harrison, who became emotional while giving evidence during the trial, told jurors that the collision was a \"tragic accident\" which occurred in circumstances he had \"no control over\".Under cross-examination, he accepted he forgot to switch on his body-worn camera and did not use his whistle as he approached the pedestrian crossing but insisted he had not been complacent that day.\"She was just there in front of me,\" he told jurors.\"She just appeared, between the kerb line and the point of collision.\"At no point did I see her on the island, I'm sorry.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter Morgan McSweeney, a man instrumental to the rise of Sir Keir Starmer, is at the centre of another political row after wave of anonymous briefings exposed tensions at the heart of government.Senior ministers have called for Sir Keir Starmer to impose order on the Downing Street operation run by McSweeney, his chief of staff, after media outlets were given reports cabinet colleagues were plotting leadership challenges.Some in government have blamed the 48-year-old adviser for being behind the briefings - and of importing a culture of off-the-record chats with journalists from opposition into Downing Street.But Sir Keir has said he is satisfied that the briefings about cabinet ministers plotting to challenge him did not come from Number 10.McSweeney has not commented on the criticism - like most people in behind-the-scenes roles in government he is not allowed to appear before the TV cameras to defend himself.And he has always sought to keep a low profile in any case. Until recently, there were few pictures of him in circulation.He derives his power and influence from his track record as a political strategist - he masterminded Labour's landslide 2024 general election victory and Sir Keir's 2020 Labour leadership bid.Like previous powerful, but unelected, advisers in Downing Street, such as Dominic Cummings or Alastair Campbell, he has been the target of negative stories.His closeness to Sir Keir - as a seasoned political operator to a relatively inexperienced prime minister - means he can be seen as \"proxy\" for the PM. One ally of the prime minister told the BBC: \"They are coming for Morgan because they want to get Keir. \"This isn't a parliamentary party battle, it's a Labour elite battle.\"McSweeney emerged victorious from an internal power struggle to become Sir Kier's chief of staff last year after the dramatic resignation of Sue Gray.Quiet, unassuming, even shy, particularly in public, McSweeney is known for being obsessed by winning, constantly fearful of complacency and ever aware of Labour’s track record of losing far more elections than it wins.Born in Macroom, County Cork, he had a comfortable upbringing as the son of an accountant and a retired office worker.He moved to London as a teenager, initially working on building sites before winning a place at the London School of Economics.He dropped out and went to live in an Israeli kibbutz for six-months, before returning to London to study at Middlesex University - leaving with a degree in politics and marketing.McSweeney then joined Labour under Tony Blair, working in a junior role at the party's headquarters. He later started working for Steve Reed, who is now environment secretary but at the time was a councillor in Lambeth, south London, where he was trying to regain control of the party from the hard left. In 2006 McSweeney helped run the party's successful campaign to take control of the council, with Reed becoming leader. His reputation as a skilled campaign strategist was further cemented in Barking and Dagenham, where the far-right, anti-immigrant British National Party was gaining support and hoping to win its first parliamentary seat 2010. McSweeney played a key role in the fight to defeat the BNP in the area, with a campaign which focused on local issues.However, his campaigns were not always a success - in 2015 he ran Blairite Liz Kendall's bid to become Labour leader, where she secured only 4.5% of votes in the contest won by Jeremy Corbyn.In 2017, McSweeney became a director of the think tank Labour Together, which opposed the direction of the party under Corbyn and went on to back Sir Keir.The Electoral Commission later fined Labour Together £14,250 for late and inaccurate reporting of donations during the period when McSweeney was a director. The fine later fuelled calls from Conservative MPs for a deeper investigation into Labour's campaign finances - though the Electoral Commission decided not to reopen an investigation.At the time of the fine, McSweeney had left Labour Together to run Sir Keir's 2020 leadership bid, later becoming his chief of staff in opposition, where he played a key role in removing Corbyn supporters from positions of power. It was here that he masterminded what became Starmer's three-year plan. First, Labour would perform \"immediate CPR\" to detoxify the party's ranks, then focus on becoming an effective opposition in parliament, before finally bidding to win power by outflanking the Conservatives on crime, defence and the economy.As Labour's campaign director, McSweeney was tasked with devising the party's strategy for last July's general election. He devised Labour's selection process for parliamentary candidates, which saw left-wing figures sidelined and caused fierce rows with the trade union movement.Among the new Labour MPs to be elected was his wife, Imogen Walker, a former councillor in Lambeth who now represents Hamilton and Clyde Valley. McSweeney was credited with keeping Labour HQ focussed on winning back so called \"hero voters\", the Leave-backing constituents who supported Boris Johnson in 2019 but were willing to swing back behind Labour.He also oversaw the deployment of money and teams into marginal constituencies, often to the detriment of senior Labour figures in safe seats.The result was a historic landslide, with Labour gaining over 200 seats despite increasing their vote share by less than two percentage points.",

The girl was pronounced dead at the scene while a 38-year-old woman from Cefn Fforest is currently receiving treatment in hospital. Armed police went to a property in Wheatley Place on Thursday following reports that two people had sustained serious injuries. Det Supt Philip O'Connell, said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident following the arrest. \"We understand that reports of this nature can be concerning, and it is likely that residents will see an increased number of officers in the area while we carry out further enquires,\" he said.He appealed for anyone with information to contact them.A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said ambulances were sent to the scene at 07:23 on Thursday, as well as two air ambulance helicopters. Police officers have been guarding the entrance to the propertyOn Thursday afternoon, two police officers were guarding the door of a semi-detached house behind a police cordon.Crime officers in white paper suits were going in and out of the house taking equipment with them, examining the interior of the home, while a police dog was searching the area to the front of the house.A large area had been sealed off with police tape in the roads surrounding the house. It was very quiet on the street with few residents moving about.Two teenage girls approached the officers at the police cordon, one who was crying.Neighbour Alun Phillips, 77, told the BBC he had been working nights and woke to banging doors this morning.He said he did not know the people in the house who \"kept themselves to themselves\".More top stories",

    "body": "3 hours agoYasmin Rufo and Eleanor ShearwoodJohan PerssonMia Carragher takes on the role of Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence in the film franchise In a corner of London's Canary Wharf, better known for finance than fireballs, The Hunger Games: On Stage has bought Panem to life in a purpose-built 1,200 seat arena.The show is an adaptation of Suzanne Collins' bestselling dystopian novels, made into a film franchise starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, in which teenagers are selected to fight to the death in a televised spectacle.The £26m Troubadour Canary Wharf Theatre, with arena-style seating, placing  audiences in different \"districts\", has been built to allow for sweeping visuals, immersive projections and dramatic aerial sequences. At one point Katniss, played by Mia Carragher, and Peeta, played by Euan Garrett, fly over the stage in a chariot on fire. While critics, including The Stage, praised the show's ambition and technical wizardry, some expressed reservations about whether the story packed enough of an emotional punch.A two-star review by the Financial Times said it was visually energetic but lacked \"a beating heart\". \"There's little emotional impact - we are watching children die and that should hit hard, but it doesn't,\" Sarah Hemming wrote.Johan PerssonNot all critics were convinced by the chemistry between Carragher and Garrett But The Stage's Holly O'Mahony called the show \"ambitious and spectacular.Her four-star review said there is \"plenty here to impress fans of the franchise, and the space is used in its entirety.\"The Independent's three-star review praised Carragher for her athletic and impressive stage debut.  Alice Saville agreed said the show has \"all the bells, bangs and whistles you'd expect – but it misses the point of her story\".A two-star review by Clive Davis in The Times said the arena looks impressive when you arrive, but once the action starts you realise the show \"struggles to fill it with enough spectacle to justify the steep prices\".The cast, including newcomer Carragher, who is the daughter of ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher, were praised for their performances.Davis said she is an \"energetic central presence\" and \"Garrett wins our sympathy\".The Guardian's three-star review from Arifa Akbar said the show is \"all spectacle above emotion\", adding: \"You don't feel the dread in Conor McPherson's adaptation, which seems clipped by the pace of events.\"But the Telegraph's Claire Alfree called the show a \"depressingly bad adaptation\" of the young adult books. Her two-star review said director Matthew Dunster, who has also directed shows including 2:22 - A Ghost Story, failed to \"reimagine and revitalise its source material\". The play has kept true to the books, and producer Tristan Baker said it was important to not have any plot changes, but there \"are lots of Easter Eggs and some wonderful surprises if you know the world\". Johan PerssonThe show has been praised for its impressive stunts and visuals Garrett, who plays Peeta, told the BBC it's important for the show \"not to be compared\" with the books because \"it's a reimagining of its own entity\". He added that Collins came to watch a rehearsal recently and \"she loved it\".\"To have her stamp of approval and blessing was a real honour,\" he said. Performances have tightened since previews started in mid-October, when early shows were branded \"chaotic\" and \"messy\" by some theatregoers, who reported long queues, delays and visible signs that parts of the venue were not completed.The show's producer, Oliver Royds, told the BBC there are \"always teething issues with shows of this magnitude\" and the team \"were slightly disappointed we didn't get it right from the very get-go\".\"We did mess up on the first night with a few issues,\" he said, adding those issues have now been rectified, and those affected by the first couple of shows have been invited back. Talking about the building process, Royds called it a \"DIY makeover on steroids\" and said 42,000 pieces of steel had to craned into the theatre, with thousands of people coming together to make it happen. 'Needs to be believable'Carragher, 21, told the BBC that the show is a real technical challenge. \"There are so many parts of the stage that open up,\" she said.\"If you put something in the wrong place, it affects the next scene. You've got to be thinking ahead of yourself so much.\"Garrett added that the emotional intensity of his performance had to run in parallel with technical precision. \"You're in an intense scene, giving everything, but you've still got to remember what needs clipping on or where a prop has to be, and making that seamless and not noticeable is the struggle.\" The show is also very physically demanding – there are the non-stop combat sequences, rapid sprints across the stage and tightly timed stunts. \"We've got to be really comfortable with each other and trust that that they're going to move out of the way when you hit them, at the very last minute,\" Carragher says.\"It needs to be believable because when we do it safe, it doesn't look as good.\" ",

    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.",
    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.The message sent by Epstein - who is alleged to have taken the photo - reads: \"Yes she [Giuffre] was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew.\"Epstein's account appears to contradict the former prince's assertion that he never met Ms Giuffre and his longstanding suggestion that the image of him with his arm around her may have been doctored.The July 2011 email was published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of correspondence from the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier's estate.Ms Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager. Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.The email from Epstein to his publicist Peggy Siegal was sent shortly after Ms Giuffre was identified publicly in the Mail on Sunday.The newspaper also printed the photo of her with Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew denied meeting Ms Giuffre and suggested that the photograph - or elements of it - may have been faked. Andrew said at the time: \"Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.\"The documents - published by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee - also suggest that Andrew and Epstein remained in contact four months after the prince claimed their relationship had ended.On 4 March 2011, Maxwell appears to have forwarded a right-of-reply email from the Mail on Sunday to Epstein. It outlines a series of allegations, including that Andrew had sex with a young woman introduced to him at Maxwell's London home in 2001.The message appears to have then been forwarded by Epstein to Andrew, via redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".Andrew's reply reads: \"Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can't take any more of this my end.\"The Mail on Sunday went on to publish its story alongside the photograph. It included allegations that girls were directed to sit on Andrew's knee at Epstein's New York home, that he groped them and took part in sexual encounters on Epstein's private island. The documents also reveal attempts by Epstein to discredit Ms Giuffre's testimony.In the July 2011 email to his publicist, Epstein also wrote: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think Buckingham Palace would love it. \"You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro [sic].\"The latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in the US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.A Democrat on the House Oversight Committee - Congressman Suhas Subramanyam - told BBC Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee. He said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\". Andrew was stripped of all his titles earlier this month after Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir renewed interest in his ties to Epstein and Maxwell.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSocial media videos showed Marc Webley taunting his rivalsA man has admitted murdering another man in Edinburgh in a gangland shooting on Hogmanay 2023.Grant Hunter, 34, shot Marc Webley at the Anchor Inn in Granton just before midnight on New Year's Eve two years ago.In the days leading up to his murder, Webley posted on social media daring his rivals to come and get him.Webley, who was 38, had a history of involvement in gangland violence. He was sentenced to 11 years in prison for attempted murder in 2005.Police ScotlandGrant Hunter will be sentenced on 17 December in GlasgowThe indictment against Hunter said the murder was \"aggravated by a connection with serious organised crime\".Hunter will be sentenced on 17 December in Glasgow.Two other people - Emma McVie, 27, and Gary Robertson 22 - also appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh and pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice.They will be sentenced at a later date.Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal ServiceCCTV of Hunter firing the gun was shown in courtOn New Year's Eve 2023, Webley was celebrating with friends when Hunter approached him and another man outside the pub in the north of Edinburgh.After a brief encounter, Hunter pulled out a gun and shot at both men.CCTV played in court showed Webley, who was wearing a stab vest at the time, running away.But he was shot in the back and died from his injuries a short time later.The other man who was shot, Stuart Pearson, was a friend of Mark Webley's. He survived his injuries.FacebookMarc Webley was gunned down outside the Anchor Inn pub in Granton on Hogmanay 2023Hunter pleaded guilty to murdering Webley and attempting to murder Mr Pearson.The judge Lord Mulholland described Hunter as a paid assassin and said the streets of Edinburgh and Scotland were not war zones.He said the fact four shots were fired at Webley showed there was no doubt he wanted him dead.Hunter was told he would get a life sentence and there was no guarantee he would ever be released.Police ScotlandEmma McVie cleaned the killer's getaway carLord Mulholland told Emma McVie and Gary Robertson they should expect lengthy sentences for aiding Hunter in trying to cover his tracks.McVie cleaned the getaway car and the clothes he was wearing. Robertson disposed of the gun, which has still not been recovered by police.Criminal Justice social work reports are being prepared ahead of sentencing next month.PA MediaForensic investigators closed off the area around the crime sceneDet Supt Graham Grant said the violence involved in the case wsas \"absolutely senseless\".He added: \"Our thoughts are with the family of Marc Webley today following these convictions.\"Although this was a targeted attack, there was absolutely no regard for the safety of the local community by discharging a firearm outside a busy pub on New Year's Eve.\"One man lost his life and another was seriously injured, but this incident could also have left other people seriously injured – or worse – and I want to make it clear this behaviour will not be tolerated.\"Violence and the carrying of firearms is completely unacceptable.\"I believe these convictions sends a message to those involved in serious criminality that we remain determined to bring you to justice.\"Floral tributes to Webley were left at the scene of the shooting",

    "body": "1 hour agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterBBCSir Keir Starmer has said he has \"been assured\" that anonymous briefings against cabinet ministers earlier this week \"did not come from Downing Street\". In a bid to draw a line under the row, he said he had \"made it clear\" to his team that such activities were \"unacceptable\".On Wednesday, Sir Keir apologised to Wes Streeting, after his allies privately told news outlets the health secretary could be planning to make a leadership challenge.Many Labour MPs remain sceptical about the claim the briefings did not come from  No 10 and blame the prime minister's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, not necessarily for the briefing, but for overseeing the strategy and culture of Downing Street. Speaking during a visit to North Wales, the prime minister said he retained full confidence in McSweeney. \"I have been talking to my team today. I have been assured that no briefing against ministers was done from No 10 but I have made it clear that I find it absolutely unacceptable.\"He added: \"I have been assured it didn't come from Downing Street but I have been equally clear that whether it is this case or any other, I intend to deal with it.\"Asked if he would sack those responsible, Sir Keir replied: \"I will absolutely deal with anybody responsible for briefing against ministers, cabinet ministers or any other ministers. \"I have always said that is the standard that I expect, and that is the standard that I will enforce.\"Asked whether he still has confidence in McSweeney, the Labour leader said: \"Of course I do. I work closely with my whole team. Our focus is on working for the country.\"Both Streeting and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband have said the person behind the briefings should be sacked.On Thursday, Streeting brushed off questions about the row saying it was \"silly Westminster soap opera stuff\" and \"yesterday's news\". Speaking to the BBC, Miliband said it had been a \"bad couple of days\", adding: \"We've got to learn the lessons of this episode and say this is not where the focus should be.\"He said he was confident the prime minister would want to find who the anonymous briefer was and \"get rid of them if he can find out\".\"He hates it when things get leaked, he hates it when cabinet colleagues get briefed against.\"People might think 'if he hates it, why can't he stop it'.\"The truth is, sometimes these things do happen. There are noises off and you can never quite know where they are coming from.\"Miliband's name has been discussed by some Labour MPs as another possible challenger to the prime minister.Asked if he would rule out returning as Labour leader, he replied: \"Yes.\"He added: \"I had the best inoculation technique against wanting to be leader of the Labour Party which is that I was leader of the Labour Party, between 2010 and 2015. \"I've got the T-shirt - that chapter's closed.\"Sir Keir apologised to Streeting in a brief phone call on Wednesday evening; however supporters of the health secretary are said to be irritated that briefing against him has continued. Those around the health secretary argue that \"this kind of briefing culture followed Keir Starmer from opposition into government\".There are a declining number of advisers who were with Sir Keir in opposition and are still working for him now.McSweeney is one of them, and the most senior. He has been approached for comment.One ally of the prime minister told the BBC: \"Morgan is a proxy for Keir. They are coming for Morgan because they want to get Keir. This isn't a parliamentary party battle, it's a Labour elite battle.\"Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Sir Keir had \"lost control of his government... and lost the trust of the British people\".She said McSweeney was responsible for the culture in No 10 and asked if the prime minister still had confidence in him.Sir Keir replied: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country.\"Let me be clear, of course, I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members, I appointed them to their post because they're the best people to carry out their jobs.\"He added that \"any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable\" and specifically praised Streeting for doing a \"great job\".",

    "body": "Type 1 diabetes is worse in the young - here's why13 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentNye familyGracie Nye in hospital when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetesScientists have discovered why type 1 diabetes is more severe and aggressive when it develops in young children.Type 1 is caused by the immune system attacking cells in the pancreas that control blood sugar levels.The research team showed the pancreas was still developing in childhood, particularly under the age of seven, making it far more vulnerable to damage.They say newly developed drugs could buy patients time for the pancreas to mature, delaying the disease.Type 1 diabetes affects around 400,000 people in the UK.Gracie, age eight from Merseyside, became suddenly ill on Halloween in 2018. It started as a slight cold, but rapidly escalated.\"She went from being a very happy one-year-old, who would go to nursery and dance and sing, to almost dying in less than 48 hours,\" says dad Gareth.\"The diagnosis remains the worst part of our life. Suddenly everything we took for granted was 10-20 times harder,\" he says.Nye familyNye family, with Gracie wearing pink glassesThe Nye family had to adapt quickly - keeping on top of everything Gracie had to eat or drink, checking blood sugar levels and giving the hormone insulin to tell her body to absorb the sugar in her blood.Gracie now has a glucose monitor and an insulin pump and is \"bossing diabetes\", says her dad.\"Gracie's a superstar,\" he adds.But why children diagnosed young like Gracie, especially those under the age of seven, have a more aggressive disease than those diagnosed in their teenage years or later, has remained a mystery.   The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows it is down to the development of the beta cells living in the pancreas.These are the cells that release the hormone insulin when sugar levels rise in the blood after we eat. Researchers at the University of Exeter studied pancreas samples from 250 donors, allowing them to see how the beta cells formed normally as people got older, and in type 1 diabetes. Diabetes UKEarlier in life these beta cells were shown to exist as small clusters or as individual cells, but as we age they grow in number and mature into larger groups known as Islets of Langerhans.The study was able to see what happened after the immune system turned against a patient's own beta cells.Beta cells in small clusters were picked off and destroyed so they never had the chance to mature. Those in larger islets were still attacked, but were more durable allowing patients to still produce low levels of insulin which reduced the severity of their disease.\"I think this is a really significant finding for type 1 diabetes - this research really sheds light on why the disease is more aggressive in children,\" Dr Sarah Richardson, from the University of Exeter, told the BBC.She said \"the future is much brighter\" for children being diagnosed with type 1 now. This includes the possibility of screening healthy children for the disease and of new immunotherapy drugs to delay it.The UK has licensed teplizumab - an immunotherapy that can stop the immune system attacking beta cells and may be able to give them time to mature - although it is not available on the NHS. \"Because we have new drugs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in children, we hope that these will be able to prevent or delay the onset in those young people,\" said Dr Richardson.Missing piece of the puzzleThe research was part of the Type 1 Diabetes Grand Challenge organised by the Steve Morgan Foundation, Diabetes UK, and Breakthrough T1D. Rachel Connor, director of research partnerships at Breakthrough T1D, said: \"This study gives us a missing piece of the puzzle, explaining why type 1 diabetes progresses so much faster in children than in adults.\"Dr Elizabeth Robertson, director of research and clinical at Diabetes UK, said: \"Uncovering why type 1 diabetes is so aggressive in young children opens the door to developing new immunotherapies aimed at slowing or stopping the immune attack, potentially giving children more precious years without insulin therapy and, one day, preventing the need for it entirely.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.But whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.Analysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched in its original, clunkier form a decade ago - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam \"power users\".In a video announcement, Valve described the new console as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\".The firm argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.But industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\".In an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.The device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.And it also claims to be bringing a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.With the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.In recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.Meanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking when its successor will appear on the market.Brandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.",

    "body": "Amber warnings have been issued by the Met Office as Storm Claudia is forecast to bring heavy and persistent rain to parts of the United Kingdom.Through Friday, rain will spread across large parts of England and Wales with a larger yellow severe weather warning also issued.There will be some flooding and difficult travelling conditions with a strong easterly wind also developing through the day.The warnings come after recent rain and flooding has already affected many areas such as south Wales last week.Storm Claudia - named by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) - has already brought heavy rain and strong winds to Spain and Portugal.But rain associated with this storm will spread quickly north across England and Wales during Friday where it will stall and become persistent for most of the day.Met Office Amber warnings have been issued for parts of south-east Wales from 12:00 to 23:59 GMT where up to 150mm of rain - nearly 6 inches - is possible over high ground.An additional amber warning will also come in to effect for the same time across parts of east Wales, the Midlands and towards eastern England.Widely 50-75mm (2-2.9in) of rain is expected throughout Friday with some places seeing up to 80mm (3in).Difficult driving conditions and transport disruption is likely and some communities could be cut off from flooding.A larger Met Office yellow severe weather warning has been issued elsewhere across England and Wales that will come into force from 06:00 GMT Friday, lasting through until Saturday at 06:00 GMT.Around 30-50mm (1.2-2.9in) of rain is expected quite widely which may also bring some localised flooding and transport disruption.Strong south-easterly winds will accompany the rain.Additional yellow warnings for the wind have been issued for the far north-west of Wales and the Pennines.Gusts up to 50-70mph (80-113km/h) could bring some minor damage and disruption.While a typical named storm in the UK might sweep in from the North Atlantic bringing strong and damaging winds,  Storm Claudia is more notable for the rainfall.Named by AEMET earlier this week for the impacts it has brought to Spain, the storm is moving up the western side of Portugal and France and approaching the UK from the south-west.And while it will turn quite windy with gusts up to 70mph (113km/h) in north-west Wales and the Pennines, the winds are not the most notable feature of this storm.Once a meteorological agency takes the decision to name a storm, there is agreement that all nations use the same name to allow consistency and clearer communication of the impacts.Claudia will not replace Bram in the list of the UK's named storms. So we can still expect the next weather event deemed serious enough to be named by either the Met office, Met Eirean in Ireland or KNMI in the Netherlands to be Bram.Rain has featured a lot so far this November with some areas seeing over their November average in the first thirteen days.Shap and Carlisle in Cumbria for example have recorded more than their November rainfall already; 226mm and 95mm compared to the averages of 205mm and 85mm respectively.Other sites on higher ground such as Honister in the Lake District has recorded over 500mm of rain.Bannau Brycheiniog - known as the Brecon Beacons - in south Wales, has also been particularly wet with many Natural Resources Wales rainfall stations recording over 200mm of rain so far.The heavy rainfall in south Wales has also led to some significant flooding.A business owner who had to close his shop in Carmarthen due to the floods described it as \"the worst in living memory\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorToday's disappointing growth figures reflect that the UK has returned to the slower lanes of growth, having outperformed earlier in the year.The 0.1% growth seen in the July-to-September quarter was below forecasts, and the economy shrank in the month of September.A breakdown in car production following the cyber-attack on Jaguar Land Rover does explain September's contraction, and why the overall growth figures were worse than expected. The ONS told me that if vehicle production had been flat rather than the worst monthly fall on record outside of the pandemic, GDP in September would have gone up. That is not the full story, though. Momentum in the economy has clearly flagged.In particular, slowdowns in consumer-facing services and business investment are a key concern.Higher costs of employment and the constantly rolling uncertainty are not helping. Consumers remain cautious, with high savings rates, and businesses have not yet turned on the investment taps.A key objective for the Budget is to end the constant doom loop of speculation about tax changes. There will be a bigger buffer against fiscal shocks, and potential changes to how often the chancellor's borrowing rules are assessed.Certainty has a price, however, in terms of tax rises. The Budget will try to target the rise in tax away from worker pay packets and investors, but the sums involved make this a tricky task.The silver lining for some to the cloudy figures is that a further Bank of England rate cut next month now seems very likely, with perhaps more to come next year.It is reflected in the declining cost of government borrowing on markets, with key two- and five-year rates now below what Labour inherited when entering office. The cost of fixed mortgage rates is also starting to come down. The chancellor will see this as vindication for a tough stance on her \"non-negotiable\" rules, and will use these figures to demand discipline over tricky Budget decisions from her backbenches. The property market has also, however, been impacted by speculation about tax changes.The feel-good factor is missing. UK consumers, unlike US consumers, have kept savings levels high, and are not spending as much. Years of rolling crises, followed by ongoing uncertainty about policy, has left scars.The UK economy has not managed to break the trend of slow growth, despite a strong-ish first half of the year. There was no growth when adjusting for the size of the population. While the economy has defied the recessionary vibes, and could still end up the second fastest G7 economy this year, the Budget somehow has to provide certainty, try to boost consumer and business confidence, and at the same time fill a large fiscal gap.It's quite the ask, and the latest growth figures have raised the stakes for the Budget even higher.",

    "body": "Kai Trump will not be short of high-profile supporters when she makes her LPGA debut on Thursday.The 18-year-old, the granddaughter of US President Donald Trump, received a sponsor's exemption to play at the Annika in Florida.Trump, a keen golfer, owns 17 courses around the world - including three in the UK - and regularly competes against Kai.\"He's pretty good. I can't say much but we have some tight matches,\" she said.Kai said Trump, who is unable to attend the Pelican Golf Club in Belleair, told her: \"Just don't get nervous.\"She said: \"My grandpa pretty much told me to go out there and have fun.\"To me, he's just a normal grandpa. He's not coming this weekend. He's running the world right now, so a little busy.\"Amateur Kai has played only three events this year and is ranked number 461 in the American Junior Golf Association rankings.But she can call upon advice from 15-time major winner Tiger Woods, who is in a relationship with her mother Vanessa.\"He is the best golfer in the entire world,\" said Kai.\"And he's an even better person. He told me to go out there, have fun, go with the flow.\"Kai will compete against some of the biggest names in the sport at the Annika, including world number two Nelly Korda, who won her third title in the event last year, England's Charley Hull, Lexi Thompson and 2023 champion Lilia Vu.The LPGA said Kai's \"broad following and reach are helping introduce golf to new audiences, especially among younger fans\".Kai has more than six million followers on social media and recently launched her own apparel and lifestyle brand.She tees off at 17:30 GMT.",

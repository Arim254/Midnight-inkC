    "body": "19 hours agoBrandon DrenonGetty ImagesL-R: Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Sarah Ferguson and Ehud BarakThe list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier.There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. Elon MuskThe documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  \"I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose\", adding that a \"peaceful island experience\" is the opposite of what he's wanting.Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to \"smear my name\", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of \"those who committed serious crimes with Epstein\". Bill GatesTwo emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates \"to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls\".In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles.\"I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?\" she said.\"At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women.\"Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: \"These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.\"Donald TrumpThe US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence.The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures.Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorPhotographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release.In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoingRichard BransonRichard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was \"really nice\" seeing him, adding: \"Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!\"Virgin Group has clarified that \"harem\" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was \"only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event\".The statement added: \"When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations.\"As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims.\"Sarah Ferguson Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest.An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: \"I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo.\"In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a \"quick cup of tea\", that includes the lines: \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.Lord MandelsonEpstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein.In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting \"anything you can help me with\". Epstein replied: \"I will wire your loan amount immediately\".A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, \"thrilled to host and sad I'm not there\".Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for \"ever having known Epstein\" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he \"was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death\". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis.Steve Bannon The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon.Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death.One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting \"first we need to push back on the lies\" and \"rebuild your image as philanthropist\". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.Miroslav LajčákAn October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\"\"Who wouldn't,\" Epstein texts back. \"You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters.\"Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing.Watch: 'Do you think you're the devil himself?' Epstein questioned in newly released interviewHoward LutnickBillionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release.In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: \"We are looking forward to visiting you\", and, \"We would love to join you for lunch\". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that \"Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing\".Larry SummersLarry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein.In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. \"Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,\" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers.Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took \"full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein\" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve TischSteve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house.In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a \"civilian\".In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a \"present\" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as \"tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic\".Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein \"had a brief association\", adding that he \"did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island\".Brett RatnerThe director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files.Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured.Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment.US Department of JusticeBrett Ratner is seen on the right here alongside Jeffrey Epstein and two women Peter AttiaThe anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims.He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show.Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was \"involved in any criminal activity\", adding that \" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties\".Casey WassermanThe chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein.Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: \"I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?\"Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein.Response: Wasserman said in a statement: \"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light.\" Sergey BrinSergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday.He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed\", and, \"Look forward to seeing you\". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails.Ehud BarakFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008.One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should \"defend myself\" or \"try to ignore\".A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments \"the horrible way\" Epstein was treated and the \"hysteria that has developed about abuse of women\".\"It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,\" the email said.Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment.Brad KarpBrad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges.In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: \"The draft motion is in great shape.\" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal.Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: \"Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm.\" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment.Bill ClintonIn the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub.Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested.Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,\" he said.\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,\" he said.In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. \"I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,\" he said. \"And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee.\"Deepak ChopraThe files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors.In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group.\"Come to Israel with us,\" Chopra says. \"Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love\"In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: \"Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise.\"Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: \"God is a construct. Cute girls are real.\"Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: \"Did you find me a cute Israeli?\"Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was \"deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case\" and denied his involvement in \"any criminal or exploitative conduct.\"\"Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors.\"The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing.",

The BBC has contacted Brioche Pasquier for comment.As well as posing a choking hazard, pieces of plastic can cause damage to the digestive system if ingested.The potential presence of the plastic pieces had made the product \"unsafe to eat\", the FSA warned.Only Pitch Chocolate filled 225g (6x37.5g) packs with the batch code UK 034 are under the recall.Consumers who have bought the affected product are advised not to eat the brioches and to contact the brand's customer care team via their wesite or by emailing technical@briochepasquier.com.The batch code and expiry date can be found on the back of the pack.Brioche Pasquier said no other batch code, nor any of its other products, had been affected.Food products are recalled when there is a potential risk to safety.On Friday, food manufacturer Danone recalled batches of its Aptamil and Cow & Gate baby formula products over concerns they contain a toxin that made them unsafe for babies to drink.",

    "body": "Five golds including big air on day one  - Saturday's Winter Olympics guideImage caption, Updated 6 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.The action actually starts a couple of days before the opening ceremony. Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day one: Saturday, 7 FebruaryMedals: FiveMedal events: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50); Women's cross country - skiathlon (12:00-13:50); Women's speed skating 3000m (15:00-1650); Women's ski jumping - normal hill (17:45-20:00); Men's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Kirsty Muir has had her struggles since reaching the Olympic final four years ago – including recovering from a torn ACL – but the 21-year-old Scot comes to Italy on the back of winning X Games gold in January and her first World Cup gold last year. Defending Olympic champion Mathilde Gremaud and China's US-born superstar Eileen Gu are both competing but Italian teenager Flora Tabanelli, the current Youth Olympic champion, has not made the start list after suffering a serious knee injury in November.Alpine skiing: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50)The first medals of these Olympics could quite feasibly all go the way of Switzerland. Back-to-back World Cup champion Marco Odermatt will start as slight favourite ahead of compatriot and 2025 world champion Franjo von Allmen. Another Swiss star, Alexis Monney, will head to the Games as Stelvio's most recent World Cup downhill winner – could he, ahem, cash in on gold ahead of his team-mates?Austria's Vincent Kriechmayr will have something to say about that, while Giovanni Franzoni, who won the recent Kitzbuhel downhill and veteran Dominik Paris, 36, will carry the weight of expectation for the host nation.Snowboard: Men's big air (18:30-19:50)Twelve of the world's top snowboarders will be showing off their tricks in one of the most spectacular sports on the Winter Olympic programme. It looks like an open competition but Japan's team is full of talent, including reigning world champion Ryoma Kimata and overall World Cup winner Taiga Hasegawa.Good to knowMixed doubles curling round robin matches continue. There's no rest for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, who are in action twice today for the third day running. At 09:05 they face Canada's husband-and-wife pair Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman. Then at 13:35 they're up against 2023 world champions Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse of the USA, who are making their Olympic debut.Men's freeski slopestyle qualifying starts at 13:00, with defending Olympic champion and 2024–25 World Cup winner Alex Hall of the USA looking like the man to beat.Day two: Sunday, 8 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50); Men's cross-country 10km skiathlon (11:30-13:00); Men's and women's snowboard parallel giant slalom (12:00-13:40); Biathlon – mixed relay  (13:05-14:40); Men's speed skating 5000m (15:00-17:20); Men's luge (16:00-19:40); Team figure skating (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Parallel giant slalom (08:00-14:00)Czech superstar Ester Ledecka takes aim at an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic gold in the women's parallel giant slalom. Ledecka made history in 2018 by becoming the first woman to win gold medals in two different sports by also winning the alpine skiing Super-G, and she could repeat the feat at these Games. Meanwhile, Austria's Claudia Riegler is set to become the oldest woman to compete at the Winter Olympics at the age of 52. Hosts Italy have several big hopes in the men's event, including reigning world champion Roland Fischnaller, who will be competing in his seventh Winter Olympics at the age of 45.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Vonn made her Olympic debut aged 17 in Salt Lake City in 2002Alpine skiing: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50)This race marks the return of legendary American skier Lindsey Vonn, six years after her retirement from the sport. Downhill is the 41-year-old's speciality and she's won a record 45 World Cup races in this event, plus her only Olympic gold medal in 2010.We will have to see how much of an affect crashing in the final World Cup downhill before the Winter Olympics hinders Vonn's bid.  Keep an eye out for her superbly-named compatriot Breezy Johnson, who is the 2025 world champion. The host nation will be hopeful of at least one podium place, although World Cup champion Federica Brignone only returned to action in January, nine months after breaking multiple bones in her left leg and tearing her ACL during a giant slalom crash at the Italian Championships. Bergamo native Sofia Goggia took downhill silver four years ago despite suffering a knee injury just 23 days before the event.Cross country skiing: Men's skiathlon (11:30-12:50)It's a fifth Winter Olympics for Britain's Andrew Musgrave, whose best Olympic result is seventh in the skiathlon in 2018. In this event, competitors complete 10km using the classical technique before changing skis and doing 10km using the freestyle technique. Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the world champion and this could be the first of a bobble-hatful of golds for the Norwegian at these Games.Snowboard: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Mia Brookes has every chance of becoming Britain's youngest Winter Olympic medallist for 78 years. The rider from Cheshire has just turned 19 but has already won back-to-back big air World Cup titles and comes to Italy fresh from winning medals in the X Games. But she will face a stacked field, including Japan's Kokomo Murase, Reira Iwabuchi and Mari Fukada, who formed a clean sweep of the medals at last year's World Championships. Austria's Anna Gasser is aiming to win the event for the third Games in a row at the age of 34. Maisie Hill, whose career was almost ended by a horrific training accident three years ago, will be Britain's other representative.Figure skating: Team (20:55)The team figure skating competition concludes with the men's free skate. The USA won gold after the Russian team was demoted in Beijing in a protracted saga that delayed the medal ceremony by over two years. The USA are the reigning World Team Trophy champions and won three of the four individual events at last year's World Championships but Japan and Georgia will be pushing them hard.Good to knowMixed doubles curling continues with another double-header for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in their final matches of the round robin stage. First up at 13:35 is Switzerland's husband-and-wife duo of Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-Hürlimann. Then at 18:05 there will be a big clash with home favourites and reigning Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini. It's a repeat of last year's World Championships final, which the Italians won.Day three: Monday, 9 FebruaryMedals: FiveMedal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)Newly-crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, will be hoping to have reached the final for a second consecutive Games. The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli.Figure skating: Ice dance – rhythm dance (18:20-2200)Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. The omens are good for the British pair – last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez.Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick – and an Olympic medal – in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix.Good to knowThe curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 – Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today.Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question – their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria.Day four: Tuesday, 10 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud – who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhoodAlpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  – Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy.Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.Good to knowMost athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) – another Olympic medal would be her 12th.Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) – and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz.Day five: Wednesday, 11 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50)Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by – the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final.Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022.Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15).Day six: Thursday, 12 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).Daily highlightsSkeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)This event promises to be one of the most entertaining – and open – of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final – which they lost – against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05).Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA – who haven't lifted the title since 1980 – face Latvia at 20:10.The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again.The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.Day nine: Sunday, 15 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "14 hours agoHarriet Agerholm,BBC NewsandSimon LockUS Department of JusticeJeffrey Epstein and Peter Mandelson onboard a yacht in an unspecified locationLord Mandelson appears to have recommended a holiday home to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein with \"privacy\" to host his \"guests\", documents released by the US Department of Justice suggest.In an email to Epstein in 2010, he says he \"found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast\" offering \"privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests'\", according to documents in which Lord Mandelson's email address is redacted.Quote marks are used around the word \"guests\".A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson said he \"did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019\" and his lawyers said he had \"no recollection of this email, which was sent over 15 years ago\".BBC News and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism have identified Lord Mandelson as the sender of the email in part because his email address is partially visible despite the redaction.It is unclear which \"guests\" are being referred to and we have not determined if Epstein went on to stay in the accommodation.The email chain in the US government release is from 12 August 2010, the month after Epstein completed his 2008 sentence for soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida.According to the document, Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is due to arrive back in London from \"Myk\", later in August.\"Found you a great place to stay on the Amalfi coast near to Positano. Zeferelli [sic] home converted into beautiful suites and privacy with accompanying rooms for your 'guests',\" he writes in a message sent from his Blackberry, the document suggests.US Department of JusticeWhile the sender of the email is redacted in the published file, the black redaction box does not completely cover his email address in one reference on the chain.The correspondence is just one exchange between Lord Mandelson and Epstein revealed in the US Department of Justice releases that sheds new light on the friendship between the men.In other published emails from 2009, Lord Mandelson asks how they should celebrate Epstein's release from prison, to which the disgraced financier responds: \"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers)\".A spokesperson for the peer said: \"Lord Mandelson regrets, and will regret until to his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality.\"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019.\"He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved.\"Epstein died in a New York prison cell in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykNurPhotoSuspected attacks on northern Italy's railway network have led to severe travel disruption in the region, the authorities say, as thousands gathered for the start of the Winter Olympic Games. Police reported three separate incidents involving damage to railway lines that they believe are connected to the Games. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, triggering delays of up to two-and-a-half hours, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.The Ministry of Transport called the incidents an act of \"serious sabotage\", which they said mirrored vandalism during the Paris Olympics in 2024. Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast. Several hours later, police discovered severed electric cables near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track nearby. Bologna's rail station is a major transport hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,\" said Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini. A police spokesperson earlier said that they were investigating the incidents and that no one had claimed responsibility. Salvini compared the events to the Paris Summer Olympics, when saboteurs damaged France's high speed rail network. \"There are similarities in action and timing to the French incident,\" he told AFP.Bologna's high speed, state-owned railway had to temporarily close, but traffic was returning to normal by Saturday afternoon. The opening ceremony of the Games took place on Friday evening in Milan, in Cortina in northeastern Italy and two other locations. Milan and Cortina are both reachable by train from Venice.Events are spread over hundreds of miles of northern Italy, in locations including the Alps and Dolomite mountains.",

    "body": "Pentagon ends academic ties with Harvard over its 'woke ideology' 4 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinAFP via Getty ImagesThe US Department of Defense is severing its academic connections to Harvard University, with Secretary Pete Hegseth accusing the oldest US university of being a centre of \"hate-America activism\".In a video posted on X, Hegseth announced the Pentagon would end graduate-level military training, fellowships and certificate programmes with the Ivy League institution.Harvard has become a \"factory for woke ideology and a breeding ground for anti-American radicals\" that does not align with the department's focus on \"lethality\" and \"deterrence\", he said.The Trump administration has threatened to cut funds to Harvard, alleging it is \"woke\" and antisemitic. The BBC has contacted Harvard for comment.Last week, President Donald Trump announced he was seeking $1bn (£730m) in damages from Harvard, after the New York Times reported his administration had to backtrack from its demand for a $200m payment in negotiations with the university. Trump accuses the university of \"feeding a lot of nonsense\" to the news outlet.In his announcement, posted late on Friday, Hegseth said he was considering ending defence department associations with other top-level universities, but primarily focused on Harvard, giving a history of its long relationship with the US military that stretched back to the first American president, George Washington.\"For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class,\" Hegseth said.\"Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard — heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks,\" he added.He called Harvard \"one of the red-hot centres of hate-America activism\".The Pentagon will end its academic relationship with the university in the autumn, giving  any military personnel  currently attending classes time to finish their studies, the department said.Along with criticising the university's teaching, Hegseth said the Pentagon was also cutting off Harvard because some of its research programmes have partnered with the Chinese Communist Party. Between 2010 and 2025, Harvard received $560m in gifts and contracts from Chinese foundations, private donors, and government entities, according to the New York Times. Hegseth also accused the university of encouraging a \"campus environment that celebrated Hamas\" and \"allowed attacks on Jews\". The Trump administration has repeatedly blasted Harvard over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests, which happened on many college campuses in the months after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.Hegseth received a Master of Public Policy from Harvard's prestigious Kennedy School, which is frequently attended by federal employees, including members of the military, in 2013. In 2022, he returned his diploma in protest against the university's classes on critical race theory. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanRussian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was attacked in his apartment building on FridayA Russian general who was shot several times in Moscow on Friday has regained consciousness after successfully undergoing surgery, according to reports in Russian media. Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, who is Russia's deputy head of military intelligence, was rushed to hospital in serious condition on Friday morning after the attack in the north-western outskirts of the capital.Two suspects have reportedly been arrested and will soon be taken in for questioning. Russian officials have blamed Kyiv for the shooting, but Ukraine's foreign minister denied involvement, according to Reuters.Doctors said on Saturday it can be \"cautiously stated that the threat to [Alexeyev's] life has passed\", Russia's state news agency Tass has reported.  The highly decorated general was ambushed on the landing inside his apartment block, where a gunman inflicted three bullet wounds, a source close to the investigation told the Kommersant newspaper.He was reportedly hit in the chest or abdomen before the attacker and an accomplice fled the scene.A neighbour in the building on Volokolamsk Highway told Reuters she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.Alexeyev was taken to a Moscow hospital with injuries where he reportedly underwent successful surgery.\"Afterwards, Alexeyev was placed in a medically induced coma. He has now regained consciousness. At this point, it can be cautiously stated that the threat to his life has passed,\" medical sources said, according to Tass.Investigators on Friday said they had opened a criminal case for attempted murder.Two suspects will be taken for questioning and a court hearing could take place on Sunday to determine their pretrial detention, Kommersant reported.Watch: BBC on the scene of Russian general shooting in MoscowAlexeyev, 64, is the latest high-ranking military figure to be targeted near Moscow since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence, he has played a significant role in the war in Ukraine and was previously awarded the Hero of Russia title for his part in Moscow's military intervention in the Syrian civil war.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.No-one has so far claimed Friday's attack, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to point the finger at Ukraine, saying it was an attempt at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told Reuters that Kyiv had nothing to do with Friday's shooting. Kyiv has claimed responsibility for some attacks on Russian military figures in the past.Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that the US had proposed talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv for the first time on American soil, \"probably in Miami\".He added that the US wants the war to end by June. There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow. ",

    "body": "19 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apesUS President Donald Trump has said he \"didn't see\" the part of a social media video which showed a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said \"I didn't make a mistake\" when asked whether he was going to apologise.He added he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight.\"I look at a lot of thousands of things,\" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that after watching only part of the video he \"gave it to the people who generally, they look at the whole thing\".He says he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, \"probably they would have had the sense to take it down\".\"We took it down as soon as we found out about it,\" he added. ReutersSome criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".\"The President should remove it,\" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.\" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who \"let the president down\". The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. In a statement sent to the BBC earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy.\" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

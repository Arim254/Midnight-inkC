    "body": "3 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentThe government is delaying reforms to the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) system and other policy proposals for schools in England until next year.It originally planned to publish its Schools White paper, which includes plans for Send, this autumn.But Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said there would be a \"further period of co-creation, testing our proposals with the people who matter most in this reform\".The Disabled Children's Partnership said the delay was \"deeply frustrating for parents\" but added it was \"important that the government takes time to make the right decisions\". The County Councils Network called it \"massively disappointing\".In a letter to Helen Hayes, chair of the education select committee, Phillipson said: \"We will bring forward a full Schools White Paper early in the new year, underpinned by our belief that high standards and inclusion are two sides of the same coin.\"Through this period of co-creation with parents, educators, experts and representative organisations, we will test policy options being considered and seek views through listening sessions in every region of the country, and fortnightly ministerial meetings with key parent and expert groups.\"Ministers have faced calls not to cut education, health and care plans (EHCPs) children and young people with Send.Last month, the education select committee recommended that the government keep them.The National Audit Office said the Send system in England was \"broken\", not financially sustainable and failing to deliver better outcomes for children and young people.Anna Bird, chair of the Disabled Children's Partnership, said the delay to the white paper was \"deeply frustrating for parents who need an end to the uncertainty swirling around Send\" provision when their lives are complex enough\".But she added it was \"important that the government takes time to make the right decisions\" and welcomed efforts \"to listen to and learn from young people, families and charities\".Cllr Bill Revans, Send spokesman for the County Councils Network, said the system was \"in crisis\" and warned that local authorities could end up £6bn in deficit by next March because of the costs associated with supporting young people with EHCPs.\"Time is of the essence - so this delay is massively disappointing. We need comprehensive changes that will make the system sustainable,\" he said.\"Anything other than root and branch reform will place councils in a vicious cycle of overspending and worsening services for families.\"Liberal Democrat schools spokeswoman Caroline Voaden said the delay was \"an absolute betrayal of every child with special educational needs and disabilities and their families\".\"Send services are already in crisis. Parents are worn out by fighting a broken system, children are waiting months or even years for vital support, and local authority budgets are at breaking point,\" she said.\"To kick the can down the road until 2026 is an admission that the government has no plan, and no sense of urgency.\"Helen Hayes told the BBC: \"I'm pleased that the government has listened to our report's recommendations and is taking the time to properly engage with families and stakeholders on its reforms to the Send system.\"She said it was \"vital\" that children and families' voices were \"at the heart of the white paper\".Additional reporting by Alex Forsyth",

    "body": "2 hours agoAmy WalkerReutersNo charges will be brought against four men arrested after images of Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected on to Windsor Castle, Thames Valley Police has said. The men - a 60-year-old from East Sussex, a 36-year-old and a 50-year-old both from London, and a 37-year-old from Kent  - were arrested in September over the incident during the US president's state visit.They were arrested on suspicion of offences including malicious communications and public nuisance.In an update on Wednesday, the force said no further action would be taken against them after an investigation concluded.The president was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump has never been officially accused of wrongdoing in connection with the deceased paedophile financier.Thames Valley Police previously launched an investigation after saying officers responded \"swiftly\" to stop the projection on the castle and arresting the men on 16 September.On the same day, Trump landed in the UK for an unprecedented second state visit. He met King Charles at Windsor on 17 September. Some protesters gathered in Windsor ahead of the visit and a significant police operation was in place in the town.The Metropolitan Police said more than 1,600 officers were deployed in central London in response to protests by the Stop Trump Coalition.",

    "body": "A Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Maine has apologised and removed a tattoo on his chest resembling a Nazi symbol that sparked backlash.Graham Platner, a 41-year-old Marine Corps combat veteran and oyster farmer, said he only realised the skull-and-crossbones tattoo resembled Nazi imagery after hearing from \"reporters and DC insiders\". The tattoo was visible in a video posted on social media showing Platner dancing in his underwear at his brother's wedding.\"I absolutely would not have gone through life having this on my chest if I knew that – and to insinuate that I did is disgusting,\" Platner said in a statement to the BBC. \"I already had the tattoo covered with a new design.\"The tattoo appears to resemble the Totenkopf - German for \"death's head\". The skull-and-crossbones symbol was used by Nazi forces during World War Two, according to the Anti-Defamation League.Platner's former political director, Genevieve McDonald, who resigned from his campaign last week, called the tattoo antisemitic. \"Maybe he didn't know it when he got it, but he got it years ago and he should have had it covered up because he knows damn well what it means,\" she said, according to US media reports. Platner, who is running in a crowded Democratic primary to be his party's nominee for the  Senate seat held by Republican Susan Collins, said he got the tattoo in Croatia with his fellow Marines in 2007. He said they picked the image off the parlour wall while drinking. \"We chose a terrifying looking skull and crossbones off the wall because we were marines and skulls and crossbones are pretty standard military thing,\" he said. Platner's campaign team said that military doctors had examined his tattoos and there were never any issues, as the Army does not allow people with tattoos with hate symbols to serve. Trump nominee withdraws after offensive texts allegedly emergeThe controversy comes amid renewed scrutiny of his social media history.Several of Platner's posts on Reddit he made years ago resurfaced last week, including remarks he made downplaying sexual assault in the military and describing himself as a communist. Platner, who has emphasised his background as a veteran and small business owner, apologised in a video, saying he made the comments after returning from war and suffering from depression. \"It left me feeling very disillusioned, very alienated, and very isolated,\" he said. \"And I think, like a lot of people, I went on the internet to post stupid things and get in fights and find some form of community.\"Senator Bernie Sanders, one of Platner's most prominent supporters, defended him on Tuesday, saying the tattoo was chosen while he was inebriated. \"He's not the only one in America who has gone through a dark period,\" Sanders said. \"People go through that, he has apologized for the stupid remarks, the hurtful remarks that he made, and I'm confident that he's going to run a great campaign and that he's going to win.\"",

    "body": "20 hours agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporter and Dharshini David,Deputy economics editorPA MediaChancellor Rachel Reeves is considering changes to the tax system which would lead to some lawyers, accountants and doctors paying more, in next month's Budget.The professions are among those which sometimes use limited liability partnerships (LLPs), meaning they are treated as self-employed and not subject to employers' National Insurance.The Times reported that Reeves would impose a new charge on people using LLPs, which would be slightly lower than the 15% rate of employers' National Insurance.Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget on 26 November, after gloomy economic forecasts and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts made it harder for her to meet her own fiscal rules.The chancellor has signalled she is likely to focus on wealthy individuals, saying \"those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share\".A number of tax experts and think tanks have suggested extending employers' National Insurance to partnerships, arguing this would make the tax system fairer.Supporters of the idea also point out it would mostly affect high earners.Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank which focuses on people on low-to-middle incomes, said: \"The chancellor will need to raise taxes in her upcoming Budget, and should do so in ways that improve the tax system. \"An important step would be to level the playing field in how different ways of working are treated, with wages currently taxed more than other forms of income.\"NHS GPs are not allowed to operate as an LLP under the terms of their contract.However, changes to the taxation of LLPs could affect locum doctors and those working in private practice.A spokesperson for the British Medical Association, the trade union for doctors in the UK, said extending National Insurance to LLPs would be highly likely to erode \"the financial viability of many small, doctor-led practices\".\"This added cost will inevitably be passed on to patients, making private care less accessible and discouraging doctors from continuing or entering private practice,\" the spokesperson added.The CenTax think tank has estimated imposing employer national insurance on all forms of partnerships would raise around £2bn a year. However, this figure would be smaller if changes only applied to LLPs.Stuart Adam, a senior economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC there was uncertainty over how much such a measure could raise as he would expect some people to restructure their tax affairs in response.He said taxing this group of people more heavily would also be \"a disincentive to work\" and \"in some extreme cases, you might see some people leaving the country or not coming to the UK in the first place\".Mr Adam added that it would not address the \"fundamental underlying issue\" that tax rates on the self-employed are much lower than on employees.A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around future changes to tax outside of fiscal events.\"Some analysts have estimated Reeves will have to raise taxes or cut spending by around £20bn to meet her \"non-negotiable\" financial rules.These rules mean her plans must be projected to get government debt falling as a share of national income by 2029-30, and day-to-day government costs must be paid for by tax income rather than borrowing.In its general election manifesto last year, Labour promised not to increase income tax, VAT and corporation tax, limiting the government's options to raise revenue.The party also promised not to raise National Insurance - prompting a row last autumn when it announced a hike in the contributions paid by employers.",

    "body": "Just nowBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS forces have struck another vessel alleged to be carrying drugs, this time in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, the Pentagon has confirmed. According to defence secretary Pete Hegseth, two people on board the vessel were killed. No US forces were harmed. The vessel was known to US intelligence and was believed to be carrying drugs along a known trafficking route in international waters, Hegseth added. The strike marks the eighth US strike against suspected drug boats since 2 September - but the first in the Pacific. Video of the strike appears to show a long, blue speed boat moving through the water before being struck by US ordinance. \"Narco-terrorists intending to bring position to our shores will find no safe harbour anywhere inour hemisphere,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Just as Al Qaeda wages war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people.\" \"There will be no refuge or forgiveness - only justice,\" he added. In a leaked memo recently sent to US lawmakers, the Trump administration said it determined it was involved in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug-trafficking organisations.At least 34 people have been killed in the American strikes on alleged drug boats, including a recent strike on a semi-submersible vessel in the Caribbean.Two men survived a strike last week, and were repatriated to Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador's government later released him - identified as Andrés Fernando Tufiño - saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing. The other man, from Colombia, reportedly remains hospitalised. US President Donald Trump and administration officials have repeatedly justified the strikes as counter-narcotics measures necessary to fight drug-trafficking organisations, several of which have been designated as terrorist organisations by the US. Citing a defence official, CBS has reported that the strike took place in international waters near Colombia.  News of the strike comes amid rising tensions between the Trump administration and the Colombian government of President Gustavo Petro. On Sunday, Trump denounced Petro as an \"illegal drug leader\" who is \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia.\"Trump added that the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, which has historically been one of its closest allies in Latin America. Both Colombia and nearby Ecuador have significant Pacific coastlines that experts have said are used to funnel drugs north towards the US through Central America and Mexico. US estimates from the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, indicate that the vast majority of cocaine bound for US cities passes through the Pacific. Drug seizures in the Caribbean - where the bulk of confirmed US strikes have so far taken place - account for a relatively small percentage of the total, although US officials have warned it is rising.To date, US officials have offered few details on the identities of those killed in the strikes or what drug trafficking organisations they allegedly belong to.Around 10,000 US troops, as well as dozens of military aircraft and ships, have been deployed to the Caribbean as part of the operation.",

    "body": "10 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere's relief for many today that inflation didn't hit the feared 4% last month - relief for households, the government and the Bank of England.But at 3.8% in the year to September, inflation remains considerably above the Bank's target and while that persists, consumers may remain jittery about spending, uneasy about the future path of prices. After all, during the spike in inflation a couple of years back, they experienced the equivalent of more than a typical decade's worth of price rises in just two years. They, and their finances, are scarred.And inflation in some areas such as services - think hotels and restaurants - remains stubborn. Sectors such as hospitality are most likely to have seen their wage bills rise substantially - analysts suggest by as much as 10% - due to government policies such as higher minimum wages and tax increases over the past year.But there are signs that things are settling down - food prices eased for the first time in months in September, as the impact of higher commodity prices fades a little. While food makes up a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, it is the most visible form of price rises. Meanwhile, economists feel that the impact of some of the other higher costs firms have been passing on may be peaking. Economists expect inflation to fall back towards the 2% target next year.And remember, on average wage rises are comfortably outpacing inflation, so the cost-of-living squeeze is easing for many, even if it may not feel like it. Plus, traditionally these figures are used to uprate many benefits for working age people - some may see an increase of about 6% in their universal credit payments next spring.Following the release of the latest inflation figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was not satisfied with progress so far in bearing down on price rises. She went on to hint at help to come in November's Budget, with, we understand, some relief expected on energy bills. Businesses, however, remain cautious - some retailers are warning that further tax rises in the Budget may cause a resurgence in inflationary pressures. And until the Bank of England feels that inflation is firmly under control, it's always going to be cautious about cutting interest rates. So while there's still unlikely to be a cut in rates in November, analysts think there may be a growing chance of a \"Santa cut\" in December - just in time for Christmas. ",

    "body": "Chess federation looking into Vladimir Kramnik's attacks on grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky5 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterCharlotte Chess CenterDaniel Naroditsky, known to his online fans as Danya, died two weeks before his 30th birthdayThe world chess federation (Fide) has said it is examining public attacks former world champion Vladimir Kramnik made against Daniel Naroditsky before the US grandmaster's death.Fide CEO Emil Sutovsky told the Reuters news agency it was \"looking into\" the Russian's previous comments accusing Naroditsky, who died this week aged 29, of online cheating.Before his death, Naroditsky denied any wrongdoing and indicated the controversy had taken its toll on him in his final Twitch broadcast.Kramnik told Reuters he did not want to comment on Sutovsky's statement, saying that he would \"rather tell the story in whole\".Naroditsky's family announced his \"unexpected\" death in a statement released by his club, the Charlotte Chess Centre, on Monday. No cause of death was given.Kramnik also indicated on X he was planning to take legal action against \"all those falsely blaming me\". He described Naroditsky's death as a \"tragedy\" that the police should investigate, adding: \"I am ready to provide all information required.\"He added that he would respond if Fide president Arkady Dvorkovich were to make a statement.US chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky dies aged 29Naroditsky was a popular player, teacher and commentator. He was a leading figure in online chess with hundreds of thousands of followers - who knew him as Danya - across Twitch and YouTube.Some prominent figures in the chess community - including world number two Hikaru Nakamura, former world champion Magnus Carlsen and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin - have condemned Kramnik's conduct.Carlsen described the way Naroditsky was treated as \"horrible\", while Sarin said on X that Kramnik \"needs to pay for what he's doing,\" adding that the late Naroditsky had been under \"immense pressure\" from his rival's accusations.'Immense pressure and pain'\"The relentless, baseless accusations and public interrogations he faced in recent months caused him immense pressure and pain,\" posted Sarin.\"This has to stop. When respected figures spread unfounded allegations without accountability, real lives are destroyed.\"He added: \"Daniel's smile faded after the attacks began. We all saw it. The chess world has lost one of its brightest lights - someone who made our game accessible to millions.\"British professional chess champion Jovanka Houska also welcomed Fide's investigation.She told the BBC's Gabriela Pomeroy: \"People should not be allowed to accuse other people of cheating just like that, and not face any consequences. It should not be trial by social media, which at times it has been.\"Nakamura - a close friend of Naroditsky - also reportedly criticised Kramnik for his behaviour, while streamer Nemo Zhou called the situation \"unacceptable\" and urged Fide to act.The organisation has expressed condolences to Naroditsky's family, saying it would honour him with a special award.Kramnik, the world champion from 2000-07 and a self-declared \"advocate for fair play in chess\", told Reuters: \"I'd rather tell the story in whole, no wish commenting on Emil Sutovsky statement, but will comment on Fide president [Arkady Dvorkovich] statement, if it will appear.\"The Russian, who has also accused other players of cheating, further commented on X: \"Without a doubt, this recent tragedy should be investigated by police, there are too many huge financial interests involved to be sure about it being just an incident. I am ready to provide all information required.\"Getty ImagesVladimir Kramnik is widely considered to be one of the greatest players in chessFormer world under-12 champion Naroditsky, whose parents were Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union, finished ninth in last year's blitz world championship.The Charlotte Chess Centre described him as a \"cherished member of the chess community, admired and respected by fans and players around the world\".Naroditsky was famous for his chess YouTube channel, which featured video tutorials and livestreams against competitors, and inspired hundreds of thousands of people across the world to play the game.Naroditsky's channel had nearly 500,000 subscribers, while his Twitch stream drummed up 340,000 followers.Fans praised his insight and passion, while the International Chess Federation said he had played a \"pivotal role in popularising chess content online\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoSean Seddon, Dominic Casciani,Home and Legal Correspondent and Andrew HardingA migrant has returned to the UK on a small boat after being removed to France under the \"one in, one out\" scheme less than a month ago, BBC News understands.The Guardian newspaper reported that the man claimed to have been been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.The Home Office declined to directly confirm the report but said a migrant had been detained and their removal was being sought as soon as possible.Forty two people who arrived in the UK illegally have been removed so far under the scheme in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection.The BBC understands the man is an Iranian national, and was initially detained on 6 August and was removed on 19 September, becoming the third person to be sent to France under the scheme. He returned four days ago on 18 October.The male migrant - who the Guardian has not named -  told the newspaper he returned to the UK because he feared for his life in France.Speaking about his alleged treatments at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"Asked about the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We will not accept any abuse of our borders, and we will do everything in our power to remove those without the legal right to be here.\"Individuals who are returned under the pilot and subsequently attempt to re-enter the UK illegally will removed.\"Maddie Harris, director of Humans for Rights Network, told BBC News her organisation has been in direct contact with the Iranian man.She said: \"From very on early [after his removal] he was experiencing acute fear... as a result of the experience he had at the hands of the smugglers.\"While in France he experienced horrendous treatment at the hands of the people who are organising journeys to the UK.\"She said the man returned because he felt he \"was not receiving protection in France and feared those individuals may continue with that horrendous treatment\".She also said her organisation had seen cases of others returned under the scheme who have had \"compelling\" evidence of mistreatment, and who were not able to receive \"adequate legal advice\" during the \"rushed\" removal process.Asked about the \"one in, one out\" scheme on Wednesday, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We've been clear about the arrangement with France, that this is the beginning of a landmark scheme which is not in itself a silver bullet\".Separately, the BBC has spoken to an Eritrean man in France who says he was also returned under the scheme.The man, who asked to be identified as Jonas, said he fled his home country because he feared religious persecution during mandatory conscription in the military.Jonas said he travelled to the UK via Belarus, Poland and France, and boarded a small boat with 71 others to cross the Channel, some of whom he said have now received asylum in the UK.Jonas said he believes he was selected for removal arbitrarily, and told the BBC he was detained for two months prior to be flown to France. Asked why he believed he was chosen for removal, he said: \"I don't know. The only reason they say is 'you came from safe country' - but it's not only me. How many people are crossing? Three thousand, four thousand [per month]?\"Jonas, who is now temporarily living in a refugee centre in Paris, would be unlikely to be deported to Eritrea from the European Union, but said he fears he would be imprisoned if he returned.The scheme, which was announced in July, is intended to deter people from crossing the Channel and encourage migrants to make asylum claims on the continent. Twenty three people have returned to France.Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim rejected.For each person returned to France, the UK has agreed to accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.On Sunday, the Home Office said 16 people had been removed to France on a single flight, the largest group removal under the scheme yet.The Iranian man's return to the UK came as small boat arrivals on Wednesday meant that the number of attempts to cross the Channel this year have now exceeded the 36,816 recorded in 2024.An official figure won't be confirmed until Thursday.The record number of arrivals for a single year was 45,755 in 2022, and this year's rate is closely tracking that.Home Office figures show that there were no crossings on six out of the last seven days but that 369 made the journey on 18 October.",

    "body": "15 hours agoSima Kotecha,senior UK correspondent and Myranda MowafiBBCMore than 300 people have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, corruption and bullying of victims by police after a Panorama undercover investigation.The secret filming over seven months revealed evidence of racism, misogyny and officers revelling in the use of force at one of London's busiest police stations.One of the main themes among the hundreds of people getting in touch was misogyny when they reported domestic abuse and sexual violence - with some women saying reporting their rape to police \"was like being raped again\".In response to the latest allegations, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was \"working hard to build a culture based on integrity and trust\" and improving vetting and misconduct procedures.We have spoken to many of the women who contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News with stories of mistreatment, whose experiences span police forces across England - from rural counties to big cities. We have changed their names to protect their identities.A police officer allegedly told Joanna to \"grow a pair\" when she reported being punched in the face by her partner several months ago, she told us.Her partner had been drinking excessively when he returned home and angrily attacked her, she says. She found herself at the local police station in tears.\"I was devastated and the police made it 10 times worse. My face had a bruise from the punch and one of the officers looked at me as if I was exaggerating the whole thing,\" she said.\"He told me to grow a pair... followed by a chuckle. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It took so much to go there in the first place and then I wished I hadn't.\"Unmasked: Secret BBC filming exposes hidden culture of misogyny and racism inside Met PoliceWhy BBC sent undercover reporter into a busy London police stationMet officers face fast-track hearings after Panorama investigationOne woman was motivated to get in touch with the BBC by a scene Panorama filmed of a Metropolitan Police officer being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence. The officer said of her account to a colleague: \"That's what she says.\"Ava was also pregnant when she fled her abusive partner, who she says repeatedly raped and hit her. She said the treatment and attitude of the officers she met that night meant she would never turn to the police in future.She said she was devastated that they did not believe her, telling her that \"nobody gets raped more than once\".\"It was like being raped all over again,\" she said. \"What they put me through was worse than what I was going through before\".Sgt Joe McIlvenny was filmed dismissing an alleged rape victim's testimonyAva says evidence that would have supported her case was \"wilfully ignored\" and she was told that without CCTV evidence of an attack, \"it is just your word against his\".She believes being a black woman made matters worse.\"The colour of my skin meant everything was stacked against me. The language they used and how dismissive and mocking they were, was both misogynist and racist,\" she said.\"They asked why I thought he was doing it to me - as if I was the problem, as if I'd brought it all on myself.\"Policing Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the government would not tolerate these \"sickening comments\" and urged people to report them.She said police chiefs had been given new powers to dismiss officers who commit gross misconduct. \"We will root out those unfit to serve the public,\" she said.Another woman, Claire, told us how she escaped her abusive former partner, who had coercively controlled her for 12 years, only to find that police did not want to get involved when he breached court orders to stay away from her.On one occasion, her former partner entered her home and locked her out, despite an injunction banning him from the property.She said it took the police more than seven hours to arrive and then \"they just stood laughing and chatting with him\". She and her three children ended up having to stay with a friend for months.\"I felt even more afraid and more isolated after speaking to the police. It's a boys' club - a network across police stations, police forces and county lines,\" Claire said.\"I would never call the police and I still worry he'll find me and show up.\"Getty ImagesCharing Cross station was the focus of the BBC's investigation, but the latest allegations come from across EnglandA training programme called Domestic Abuse Matters was developed by the College of Policing in 2016. It is used by 37 out of 44 police forces in England and Wales to improve the way they deal with victims of sexual and domestic violence.And part of the NPCC and College of Policing strategy on violence against women and girls says that one of its priorities is to challenge sexism and misogyny among officers.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Millichap, NPCC lead for violence against women and girls, told the BBC police chiefs were working with survivors of domestic abuse and sexual offences to continue to reform training, \"with a key focus on first responders' understanding of the dynamics of abuse and their empathy with victims\".She said \"officers must feel confident in calling out misogyny and sexism within policing\" but that improved vetting and misconduct procedures were \"having an impact in identifying and dismissing those who should not be in policing\".One of the women who contacted the BBC said that having watched the Panorama programme, she was shocked that nothing had changed in the decades since she was raped as a teenager.\"I have never had a night without a nightmare as a result, I've buried a lot of what the police officers asked me. They spoke down to me - like I was part of the problem,\" the woman, now in her 40s, said.\"Watching Panorama, I realised I must be one of thousands, I'm not the only one. They made me feel I was.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

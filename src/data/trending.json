The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons. And how a lost radio play by Tennessee Williams was found more than four decades after his death, and has now been heard for the first time.\nThe Global News Podcast brings you the breaking news you need to hear, as it happens.

    "body": "4 hours agoThe Guardian leads with an interview with the government's social mobility commissioner, Alun Francis, in which he says that the government lacks an \"overarching narrative\" to pull various social mobility policy strands together and urges Sir Keir Starmer to set out a clearer strategy. It also features a photo of people celebrating the winter solstice at Stonehenge.The Times also features a photo from the winter solstice, above a story reporting that Health Secretary Wes Streeting has suggested that the UK should join a customs union with Europe, despite Prime Minister Keir Starmer ruling out a change in policy. The Daily Mirror leads with a story on how a poll shows that ex-Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner's \"legal threat\" over his Strictly exit has \"taken a hit\" after a new poll suggests he was the least-popular dancer. It follows reports Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the vote was rigged against him. The BBC has rejected the allegation, saying Strictly's public vote was \"independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy\".The Daily Mail leads with an investigation on how \"criminal migrants\" are reportedly avoiding justice by being smuggled out of the UK in lorries. It focuses on an Albanian man who the paper reports has been running a network helping people flee for £2,500.The i leads with a story on how almost 7,000 care home residents in England were told their contracts were being terminated with just 28 days notice last year.The Financial Times leads with a story on how UK firms attracted interest from international buyers eager to capitalise on cheap valuations this year. Overseas bidders agreed $142bn in takeovers of UK companies, according to data from the London Stock Exchange Group - a 74% rise from 2024.The Sun reports that Princess Beatrice will not join her \"scandal-hit dad\", Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, for Christmas this year and will go skiing with friends instead. Andrew has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Daily Telegraph leads with a story on how the new head of the equalities watchdog has criticised people who describe migration as a risk to the UK. It also has a story on how trail hunting will be banned in what the paper calls Labour's \"war on the countryside\". The Daily Express speaks to a woman who is calling for child abuse \"monsters\" to be named on a national register. Paula Hudgell's adopted son, Tony, was \"horrifically injured\" by his birth parents, the paper reports.And the Daily Star says it has \"teamed up\" with Kenyan darts star David Munyua.

    "body": "The chair of the King's Foundation Dame Ann Limb has admitted being \"misleading\" about her doctorate qualification.The education specialist, who was recently nominated for a life peerage by Labour, told the Sunday Times that she had not completed a PhD at the University of Liverpool, despite this appearing on her since-amended CV.\"To be completely upfront and honest about it, I never completed my PhD at Liverpool University,\" she told the newspaper, adding that she used the Doctor title because she had been conferred with honorary PhDs by other institutions.The BBC has contacted Dame Ann for comment. The King's Foundation declined to comment.Dame Ann was among nominees to the House of Lords announced by Downing Street earlier in December, having held a number of senior public and private roles.The King's Foundation - which offers courses in practical skills to young people - announced last week that she would be stepping down from her role as chair, which she had held since January, to become a peer.An old version of her online CV, seen by the BBC, refers to her with the \"Dr\" honorific and lists a PhD from the University of Liverpool  in 1978 as among her qualifications.She was referred to as Dr Ann Limb by the City & Guilds Foundation, which she also chairs, in 2020, and in the Queen's Birthday Honours list announcing her damehood in 2022.However, a new version of her CV - made in July 2024 - omits the Dr honorific and the supposed 1978 PhD, stating that she received honorary PhDs from Anglia Ruskin University and the University of Northampton.Her website still says that she began her teaching career in further education \"whilst undertaking a PhD at the University of Liverpool\".She told the Sunday Times: \"I have used the word 'Doctor'... because I have got several honorary PhDs and that's been clear to me that they're honorary.\"Perhaps my own website is not very helpful, I don't pay a lot of attention to it, but if there's anything misleading... on that I'm very happy to correct [it].\"The newspaper also reported she claimed to have gained an MA from the Institute of Linguistics, which she also admitted was untrue.Recipients of honorary doctorates tend not to use the Dr honorific despite technically being able to out of deference to those who have undertaken the academic work to receive a PhD. When approached for comment, a No 10 spokesperson directed the BBC to a document listing the reasons why Dame Ann had been nominated for a peerage.That document notes she has been the chair or non-executive director of several public, private and charity bodies.Dame Ann grew up in Moss Side in Manchester and is currently the pro-chancellor of the University of Surrey and chair of institutions including the Lloyds Bank Foundation.She was made a dame for services to young people and philanthropy, having spent much of her career in higher education.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSharon BarbourHealth correspondentA shortage of epidural kits in the UK is expected to last until at least March, the government's medicines regulator has warned.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) told healthcare providers in a patient safety alert earlier this month that the shortage followed manufacturing issues concerning epidural bags.Hospitals are being sent substitutes bags for the pain relief drug given to women in labour, while the Royal College of Anaesthetists is working with the NHS to advise hospitals on how to manage the situation.Medical staff have expressed concern about these plans, the BBC understands, though the NHS said women \"should come forward for care as usual\".The shortage arose after a major supplier stopped making epidural infusion bags, it is understood.The MHRA alert on 2 December said there was a \"range of alternative\" bags available during the \"affected period\", which will require a \"trust-wide approach to ensure safe implementation\".Hospitals are being sent substitutes - but these have higher drug doses and so need very careful managing.All trusts have been asked to create teams that ensure mother-and-baby safety.But hospital staff, pharmacists and anaesthetists - who administer epidurals to women during labour - have expressed concerns over the plans.The head of the Birth Trauma Association, Dr Kim Thomas, argued that \"there hasn't been enough communication\" on how to put together these teams.\"Leaving trusts to manage a situation like this is very unfair, because you're going to get different responses in different trusts,\" she explained. \"It's going to mean added stress and added work for staff who are already overworked particularly at this time of year.\"An NHS spokesperson said: \"The safety of women in the care of NHS maternity services remains a top priority.\"They added: \"There are a range of alternatives available and trusts are also sharing supplies with other nearby trusts where appropriate.\"Additional reporting by Hafsa Khalil",

    "body": "1 hour agoBen Wright,BBC political correspondentandGeorge Wright,BBC News digitalSir Keir Starmer does not have a \"coherent approach to social mobility\", the government's social mobility commissioner has said.Alun Francis, a top adviser to the government, told the Guardian that there was no \"overarching narrative\" to pull various policy strands together and called on the prime minister to set out a clearer strategy.A report by the commission released last week warned that \"extreme regional disparities exist\" in the UK, with many former industrial and mining areas worst affected.\"We have a government that talks quite a lot about social mobility, but mainly about individuals – often about [the] social mobility of themselves or their colleagues,\" Francis said.\"But what we don't have is a coherent approach to social mobility as a useful concept that you can build a strategy around.\"While praising individual policies on housing and skills, he said other proposals had been \"stop-start\", while almost one million young people are now outside education, work or training.\"We've got other policies like growth, educational improvement where we're just not sure where we're going,\" Francis said.Without an overall strategy, he said, the government would \"struggle to address some of those issues and have a clear-headed view about what we might do to improve things\".Among the conclusions of week's report were that a child's family background still heavily shapes their education level and future life chances in the UK. It also said there were \"extreme regional disparities\" within the country. A government spokesperson called the number of young people outside education, work or training a crisis that couldn't be ignored and said a review by Alan Milburn would help build a system that ensured every young person had an opportunity to make something of their lives.The report listed North East of England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the West Midlands as facing \"enduring disadvantages\", while former mining areas in Wales and Scotland are also \"notably disadvantaged\".However, new areas outside London with \"favourable conditions for innovation and growth\" include Aberdeen, Brighton, Bristol, Chester, Edinburgh, Oxfordshire, Reading and West Berkshire, the report said.It also noted that almost half of young people aged 25 to 29 years were in professional occupations between 2022 and 2024 - up from 36% between 2014 and 2016.But people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds \"don't benefit as much from these opportunities as their peers\", it said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. Afcon is typically held every two years and this time Morocco is hosting. Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKate McGoughEducation reporterDan Nelson / BBCMany children find themselves singing at school in the run up to Christmas - at a nativity play or carol concert, often with parents watching proudly on.But new data suggests singing is a much less common occurrence throughout the rest of the school year, especially after pupils leave primary school.Now, an association of music teachers says every school should have a choir, to help pupils embrace music after a years-long decline in its popularity as a GCSE subject.The government says it is investing in high quality music teaching and that a \"renewed curriculum\" will encourage more people to study it.In a recent survey, Teacher Tapp asked just under 10,000 teachers in England how often their whole school sang together in assembly. Over half of state secondary school teachers (57%) said their pupils never sang together in assembly, while just 13% of private secondary school teachers and only 4% of primary teachers said the same. Teachers were separately asked whether their schools had a choir. Just over a third (36%) of teachers at state secondaries reported having no choir at their school, compared to just 8% of private school secondary teachers.Having access to multiple school choirs was much more common at private schools, with three quarters (77%) of private secondary teachers saying their school had more than one choir, compared to 27% of state secondary teachers.Jackie Bowen, head teacher at The East Manchester Academy, says secondary school pupils can feel \"embarrassed - or that maybe it's not cool to sing like it was in primary school\".But she says singing and music are priorities at the school.Dan Nelson / BBCJackie Bowen says music is part of the fabric of school life for her pupils\"We know the intrinsic value of music, but also what it does for students' development, mental health, its impact on academic achievements,\" she says. \"So we've run lots of initiatives to try and break down barriers to music.\" The school offers a music hub at the school once a week, offering pupils time with specialist teachers from the Royal Northern College of Music. At lesson changeover, students hear classical music instead of the traditional bell. The school has also established its first gospel choir. Year 11 student Mercy, who's part of the choir, says she always wanted to continue singing at secondary school.\"In primary they say you have to sing, but when you come to secondary it's a choice, so most people don't do it,\" she says. \"I feel like we should all release our voices to the world. Whether you're good or not, just sing.\"Kate McGough / BBCMercy is part of her school's gospel choir and says she enjoys singingThere has been a 25% drop in pupils studying GCSE music at schools in England over the last fifteen years, despite an uptick in the most recent stats. That is partly down to the introduction of a progress measure for schools called the English Baccalaureate in 2010, which assessed schools based on how many pupils took English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they performed.The government recently announced that it would be changing the school curriculum in England to make it easier for more schools to offer arts subjects like music.There has been some improvement in recruiting new music teachers this year, but the levels still fall 35% short of government's target for trainee music teachers in the most recent stats.James Manwaring, president of the Music Teachers Association - which represents music teachers across both state and private schools - says every school should have a choir.\"All you need is a room and you need someone to lead it and you need students,\" says James, who is also the director of music at Windsor Learning Partnership - a multi-academy trust of six state schools.\"It's a shame to think some state schools aren't capitalising on that.\"He says changes to the school curriculum in England are \"very exciting\" for boosting music in schools, but says more funding and resources will be needed -  \"as well as retaining the wonderful music teachers we have out there\".Dan Nelson / BBCMusic teacher Rob Hatton set up the gospel choir for students at The East Manchester AcademyA Department for Education spokesperson said the government was committed to ensuring art, music and drama \"are no longer the preserve of a privileged few\".Ministers are \"investing millions\" to help schools invest in musical instruments and equipment, and \"supporting high quality music teaching through our Music Hubs\", they said. \"Our renewed curriculum will also give every young person the skills, knowledge and experiences needed to achieve and thrive, including encouraging more people to study music and other creative subjects.\"",

    "body": "The police watchdog says it may investigate West Midlands Police over its handling of the decision to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an Aston Villa game.The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) told the BBC it can exercise its power to investigate \"if evidence available to us appears to warrant\" it, but that it needed to assess that evidence \"before determining our next steps\".Its director Rachel Watson is quoted by the Sunday Times as saying she was willing to use the watchdog's \"power of initiative\" given the \"sensitivities\" of the case.Maccabi fans were prohibited from attending a 6 November match in Birmingham based on reports of hooliganism at other away games they attended.However, the government's adviser on antisemitism has since said that some of the intelligence the force used to come to the decision was \"inaccurate\".Lord Mann told the Home Affairs Committee earlier this month that some facts about the earlier matches had been changed to fit the decision.West Midlands Police also faced criticism over two of its high-ranking officers appearing to reiterate some of these inaccuracies before the committee.The IOPC tends to investigate cases that have been referred to it by individual police forces - usually when someone has died due to police action, or if a police officer is accused of a criminal offence.As such, instigating its own investigation without a referral is relatively rare.The IOPC is not yet investigating the force's decision, but a spokesperson said on Sunday: \"It is right for public confidence and police accountability that the force's involvement in the decision-making process is examined.\"They noted HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services was examining the risk assessment West Midlands Police carried out before the fixture and the extent to which the intelligence it gathered \"reflected the full information and intelligence picture\".They added that the Home Affairs Committee has asked the force for \"additional evidence\" relating to Chief Constable Craig Guildford and Assistant Chief Constable Mike O'Hara's committee appearance earlier this month.\"It is important for us to assess evidence related to these processes before determining our next steps.\"The IOPC spokesperson said it had written to West Midlands Police and the region's police and crime commissioner to \"seek assurances over what assessments they have made of any conduct\".They said this was important \"to understand why a formal referral has not been made\".MPs previously heard that the ban was based on information given to the force by Dutch police commanders concerning violence that broke out in Amsterdam last year during a Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi.Following this, Dutch courts said evidence showed fans of the Israeli club faced violence, and also pointed out that the club's supporters pulled down Palestinian flags, vandalised taxis and chanted racist slogans against Arabs.Despite West Midlands Police saying the decision \"wasn't taken lightly\", senior MPs, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, said it amounted to antisemitism.Lord Mann told the Home Affairs Committee that there were several inaccuracies in West Midlands Police's intelligence report.He said it cited Maccabi fans \"pulling down Palestinian flags\" on match day in the Netherlands, when the incident occurred the night before. It also referred to a match between Maccabi and West Ham which never happened.The force also had to apologise over ACC O'Hara's repeated affirmation to the committee that representatives of the Jewish community had said they did not want Maccabi fans at the match, when they had said no such thing.This week, Maccabi Tel Aviv was fined €20,000 (£17,550) for \"racist and/or discriminatory behaviour\" by supporters during their game at Stuttgart in Germany on 11 December. Fans were also given a suspended one away match ban.",

Earlier this month Duncan-Glancy stood down as the party's education spokeswoman after admitting an \"serious error of judgement\" over her links to Sean Morton.The Glasgow region MSP submitted her resignation after the Daily Record newspaper said she had maintained contact with Morton, a former Labour councillor who admitted having indecent images of children and extreme pornography in 2017.At the time Labour said she had done the right thing and it considered the matter closed.Duncan-Glancy, who was elected to Holyrood in 2021, had been selected to contest a Glasgow seat.But in statement, issued on Sunday, the MSP confirmed that she had withdrawn her candidacy.Duncan-Glancy said: \"While this has obviously been a very difficult decision - and it is the greatest honour of my life to represent Glasgow - I do not wish for a personal friendship to become a distraction.\"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve, and I remain committed to returning a Scottish Labour government next year.\"Morton, a former councillor for Fochabers Lhanbryde, was ordered to carry out unpaid work and put on the sex offenders register after he pled guilty to possessing two indecent child image offences.He had claimed the images were sent to him anonymously.A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: \"Pam Duncan-Glancy has withdrawn as a parliamentary candidate for the Glasgow Kelvin and Maryhill constituency.\"She has taken the decision to step aside as she does not wish recent stories to become a distraction from the work of the party or its priorities.\"The selection process will now be reopened so that a replacement candidate can be chosen.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoClaire KeenanandElettra NeysmithAFP via Getty ImagesSt Mary's Catholic school in central Nigeria where schoolchildren were abductedNigerian authorities say they have secured the release of the remaining 130 schoolchildren kidnapped from a Catholic boarding school in the country's central Niger state.Nigeria's federal government described the latest release as a \"moment of triumph and relief\", after one of the country's worst mass kidnappings.More than 250 children and staff were abducted from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri on 21 November. Earlier this month about 100 of the children were released.The authorities confirmed \"the rescue of the remaining 130 children and staff\" in a statement, saying \"not a single pupil is left in captivity\".Presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga said on Sunday the total of freed students was now 230.Since the kidnapping, the exact number of people taken and how many have remained in captivity has been unclear.It has not been formally made public how the government secured the latest release - or whether any ransom was paid.The announcement by Onanuga included pictures of children smiling and waving. The students are expected to arrive in the Niger state capital, Minna, on Monday.When the earlier release happened the governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.The Christian Association of Nigeria reported that 50 students managed to escape at the time of the kidnapping.November's abduction was the latest incident in a growing number of targeted attacks on schools and places of worship in north and central Nigeria.The attack on St Mary's in November was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier.On 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state.All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments.On 9 December Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said his government would continue to work with Niger and other states \"to secure our schools and make the learning environment safer and more conducive for our younger ones\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoHarry Farley,political correspondent,andFiona NimoniThe Electoral Commission has found no \"credible evidence of potential offences of electoral law\" over Nigel Farage's election expenses.The watchdog said it would take no further action in a letter to Reform UK's treasurer, shared with the BBC.It comes after a former member of Farage's campaign team claimed Reform spent more than the £20,660 spending limit set in law.Essex Police said last week that it would not investigate the matter because more than a year had passed since the alleged offence.The election agent for Nigel Farage in Clacton, Peter Harris, said the complaint had been \"politically motivated\".\"The facts are clear, the process has been properly followed, and there is no basis for any further allegation, inference, or repetition of these claims,\" he added. The commission wrote in its letter that it had \"not identified any omissions of expenditure that ought to have been declared\" in Farage's campaign to be elected in his Clacton constituency.It added: \"We did not identify credible evidence of potential offences of electoral law. \"Therefore, our decision is to close our consideration of the matter following initial enquiries and take no further action.\"The claims of wrongdoing against Nigel Farage and his party were made by ex-Reform campaigner Richard Everett.He alleged the party failed to declare spending on some leaflets, banners, utility bills and the refurbishment of a bar in the Clacton constituency office.Documents were passed to the Metropolitan Police, which transferred the case to Essex Police.Earlier this week, an Essex Police spokeswoman said: \"Any prosecution for such an offence must commence within one year.\"She said an \"allegation around misreported expenditure by a political candidate\" in July 2024 was made on 5 December.\"It has been concluded that this report falls outside of the stated statutory time limit, and no investigation can take place,\" the spokeswoman added.Farage took over as leader of Reform UK in June 2024, about a month before the general election.He went on to win the seat of Clacton in Essex from the Conservatives with a majority of more than 8,000.",

    "body": "The US Coast Guard is in \"active pursuit\" of another vessel in international waters near Venezuela as tensions in the region continue to escalate.US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. Sunday's pursuit related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official said. \"It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\"Washington has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"theft and kidnapping\".US President Donald Trump last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.Venezuela - home to the world largest proven oil reserves - has accused the Trump administration of trying to steal its resources. US authorities have not yet officially confirmed Sunday's pursuit, and the exact location and name of the tanker involved is not yet known. As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com.Saturday's seizure saw a Panamanian-flagged tanker boarded by a specialised tactical team in international waters. That ship is not on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, but the US has said it was carrying \"sanctioned PDVSA oil\". In the past five years the ship also sailed under the flags of Greece and Liberia, according to records seen by BBC Verify.\"These acts will not go unpunished,\" the Venezuelan government said in response to Saturday's incident. It added that it intended to file a complaint with the United Nations Security Council and \"other multilateral agencies and the governments of the world\".Venezuela is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.In recent weeks, the US has built up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.Sanctions also were placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US calls his illegitimate regime.Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Friday: \"It is clear that the current status quo with the Venezuelan regime is intolerable for the United States.\"He added that the goal of the Trump administration is to change that dynamic.  His comments were criticised by Venezuela's foreign minister who accused Rubio dragging the US down the path of \"regime changes\". It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The Trump administration has accused Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.",

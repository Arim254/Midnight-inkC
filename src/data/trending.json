One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "Canadian-American rock star Neil Young is offering Greenlanders a year's free access to his archives in what he hopes will \"ease some of the unwarranted stress and threats\" they are receiving from the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has threatened to annex the Danish territory for what he says are national security reasons, though recently walked back comments, saying he was seeking \"immediate negotiations\" and insisting he \"won't use force\". Young is known for his political protests, and has long been a vocal critic of Trump. He announced the offer \"of peace and love\" on his website, where he added that he hoped \"other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example.\" In his statement, signed \"love earth\", Young refers to the Trump administration as \"our unpopular and hopefully temporary government\".Access to Young's digital archive usually starts at around $25 (£18), depending on the subscription package. To secure free access, a Greenland registered mobile phone number will be required for verification.Earlier this month, Young wrote on his website: \"Wake up people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes... He has divided us.\" In 2020 Young took legal action to try to stop Trump using his music at campaign rallies.Young has also called on people to boycott Amazon over owner Jeff Bezos's donations to the Trump campaign and support for the administration. In 2024, Young ended a two-year boycott of streaming giant Spotify, which he had started in opposition to the platform streaming Joe Rogan's podcast.In 2022, he told Spotify to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation on the streaming service. Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity.The singer said at the time that his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance, but that the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m (£181m) deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive.Neil Young was born in Canada but later moved to the US and holds dual citizenship.

    "body": "The scramble for tickets to K-pop band BTS' comeback tour, which comes after a four-year hiatus, has seen Mexico's president appealing to her South Korean counterpart to add more shows in her country.\"I wrote a letter to the [president] of Korea... I still haven't received the answer, but let's hope it's positive,\" Mexico's president Claudia Sheinbaum said on Monday.BTS will hold three shows in Mexico City in May, as part of its 79-date world tour after a four-year hiatus. Tickets were wiped out in less than 40 minutes, local media reported.Some fans have also accused Ticketmaster and resale platforms of dynamic pricing, prompting an investigation.While on Ticketmaster, the official sales channel, tickets were going for between 1,800 pesos and 17,800 pesos ($100 to $1,030; £76 to £750), resale platforms were offering them for between 11,300 to 92,100 pesos, according to Reuters. Mexico's consumer watchdog has sanctioned resale platforms StubHub and Viagogo for \"abusive and disloyal practices\" over the ticketing process.About a million young people were vying for 150,000 BTS concert tickets, Sheinbaum said on Monday.\"This group, BTS, is very popular among young Mexicans,\" she said.Spotify lists Mexico as K-pop's fifth-largest market worldwide, with streaming of the genre's songs growing more than 500% in the country in the last five years. Sheinbaum wrote to South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung after being told by local concert promoter Ocesa that the band's packed itinerary made adding shows unfeasible.Seoul's presidential office and foreign ministry have declined to comment on the matter, according to South Korean media.BTS has not released music as a group since June 2022, as they took a break to explore individual music careers and later underwent mandatory military service.The septet's globe-spanning comeback tour – likely to be one of the biggest tours of the year – will kick off with three nights in South Korea's Goyang Stadium on 9 April, before travelling across across Asia, Europe and America.According to Billboard, the group and their record label Hybe stand to make more than $1bn (£740m) from the tour, across concerts, merchandise, licensing, album sales and streaming revenue.",

    "body": "Five prisoners serving indefinite sentences referred for appeal47 minutes agoTabby WilsonBBC NewsnightBBC Newsnight spoke to Matthew Booth, 34, about the IPP sentence he received 16 years agoFive prisoners serving indefinite sentences have been referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), BBC Newsnight has been told.Despite being abolished in 2012, there are still 2,800 prisoners serving open-ended sentences, which were issued to people deemed dangerous but whose offence did not merit a life sentence.Many on Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentences have served longer than the minimum tariff they were originally given.Interim chair of the CCRC Dame Vera Baird told Newsnight that the five IPP prisoners were all men who remained in custody after originally being sentenced between 2002 and 2010 when they were in their late teens.She said the Court of Appeal had shown \"a bit of a change\" in its attitude, recognising that \"young men like these were when they were sentenced are very different from mature men\".A change in legislation has also been made to ensure those serving IPP sentences in the community could be more swiftly considered for an end to their period on licence, according to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).Getty ImagesThe Court of Appeal of England and Wales is located at the Royal Courts of Justice in LondonMatthew Booth, 34, told Newsnight he received an IPP sentence when he was 15 years old, following his conviction for wounding with intent and unlawful wounding.He originally served more than six years in prison for those convictions, but was recalled four times for breaches in his IPP licence conditions. One such breach included being in a relationship that he did not declare.\"I don't think any child should get IPP because of what you go through,\" he said, speaking for the first time since his release from prison last week.He continued: \"You're just feeling like there's no help. There's no hope. It just takes a toll on you. It changes you. That's what's building up inside of you, in your character.\"Dame Vera echoed his words, noting that IPP sentences assessed people for what they might do, rather than what they had actually done.\"These are sentences which just bring people into hopelessness,\" she said. An MoJ spokesperson said it was: \"Right that IPP sentences were abolished and we have already taken action to support these offenders to move on.\"The government announced in November last year that it would automatically pardon grooming gang survivors, where people were convicted or cautioned as children for loitering and soliciting for prostitution offences.Dame Vera revealed it had referred its first \"grooming gang victim... to try and get her conviction quashed\".She appealed for people to \"come forward\", adding the CCRC was \"working with charities which help post-grooming people to get over their trauma and they are going to find out for us if they've got a conviction because we need people to come forward\".",

    "body": "Just nowChris Mason,Political editorandIsabella Allen,Senior political producerThe prime minister spoke to Andy Burnham on Monday and was in touch with him again on Tuesday, following Labour's decision to block him from standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election.Speaking to reporters on the plane to China, Sir Keir Starmer rejected claims Burnham had been told in advance he would not be accepted as a candidate, adding: \"I know who was talking to Andy on Saturday and that wasn't said.\"Some reports suggested the Greater Manchester mayor had been told he would be barred from standing if he applied, a claim Burnham has also denied.On Sunday, Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) blocked Burnham from standing to \"avoid an unnecessary mayoral election\".The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne stood down on Friday as an MP on health grounds.Burnham, a former minister, is widely seen as a potential leadership challenger to Sir Keir, should he return to Westminster.Asked if he would welcome Burnham back into the House of Commons, the prime minister said \"that's a matter for Andy\" and that he was doing a \"first-class job\" as mayor of Greater Manchester.The prime minister claimed that only Labour could beat Reform UK in Gorton and Denton.\"You can see from their [Reform's] candidate what politics they're going to bring to that constituency, the politics of division, of toxic division, of tearing people apart,\" Sir Keir said.\"That's not what that constituency is about, it's not what Manchester is about, so this is a straight fight between Labour and Reform and there's only one party that can stop the politics of Reform in the by-election and that's the Labour Party.\"The academic-turned-political campaigner Matt Goodwin has been selected as Reform's candidate in the forthcoming by-election.The Workers Party of Britain has announced Shahbaz Sarwar - a councillor on Manchester City Council, representing Longsight ward - as its candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election.A 10-member panel of Labour's ruling body, the NEC, blocked Burnham's candidacy over the weekend, citing the \"disproportionate\" cost to the party of taking part in a contest to replace him as mayor.Sir Keir was among eight NEC members voting to bar Burnham.Burnham denied reports that he had been told beforehand by Downing Street that he would be prevented from standing.\"It is simply untrue to say that I was told that I would be blocked,\" he told reporters. \"I went through the whole weekend having conversations with people in No 10.\"The BBC has been told about 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter urging the NEC to \"re-evaluate\" its decision.At the 2024 general election, Labour won Gorton and Denton with a 13,000 majority. Reform UK came second with 5,000 votes, narrowly beating the Green Party into third place.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKelly NgandHosu Lee,SeoulThe wife of South Korea's ousted former president has been sentenced to 20 months in jail for accepting bribes from the controversial Unification Church.However, the court cleared 52-year-old Kim Keon Hee on charges of stock price manipulation and receiving free opinion polls from a political broker before the 2022 presidential election, which her husband Yoon Suk Yeol won.Yoon has already been sentenced to five years' in jail for abusing power and obstructing justice in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This marks the first time in South Korea's history that a former presidential couple are convicted at the same time.On Wednesday, Judge Woo In-sung at the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Kim had \"misused her position as a means of pursuing personal gain\".\"The higher [one's] position, the more consciously one must guard against such conduct... The defendant failed to reject solicitations and was preoccupied with self-adornment,\" the judge said.A special counsel team appointed to the case said Kim received 80m ($56,000; £40,600) won of gifts, which include a Graff diamond necklace and several Chanel handbags, from the Unification Chruch between April and July 2022, in exchange for business and political favours. The team had sought a 15-year jail term and a fine of 2 billion won for all three charges heard on Wednesday – for which Kim was convicted of one – but the judge noted that Kim was not the one who demanded or solicited the bribes, and that she had \"no significant criminal record\". She was however ordered to pay back 12.85 million won in cash and the court also ordered the confiscation of the diamond necklace.Kim has also been charged over her alleged involvement in a scheme to recruit Unification Church followers to the conservative People Power Party that her husband was part of, and accepting gifts in exchange for government job appointments. The court has yet to hear those cases. The former first lady had denied all charges, saying they were \"deeply unjust\", although she did admit to receiving Chanel bags, which she said she later returned without using.She made a public apology when she appeared for questioning last August. \"I am truly sorry that a nobody like me has caused concern to the people,\" she said.Investigations into Kim's dealings with the Unification Church had also led to the arrest of church leader Han Hak-ja. Apart from the criminal allegations, Kim has also been the subject of other controversies. Last year, Sookmyung Women's University annulled an art education degree she graduated with in 1999, after an ethics panel found she had plagiarised her master's thesis.Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi in Seoul",

    "body": "3 hours agoChancellor Rachel Reeves has revealed a support package for British pubs, which the Mirror describes as \"long-awaited\". \"Half measures\" declares the paper, reporting that publicans have not been impressed by the 15% discount on business rates she announced. The discount will come into effect in April.The Wednesday edition of the i Paper calls the move a \"pubs u-turn to save Britain's locals from extinction\". The chancellor has risked a backlash from other hospitality venues, the paper says, who have not been included in the temporary extra support. It adds that diners and travellers can expect to face price increases for food, drink and hotel rooms this spring, as a result of higher property taxes.The business rates \"u-turn\" has been branded \"too little, too late\" by the Mail, which warns of a \"high street meltdown\". It says the exclusion of small shops, restaurants and hotels from the discounted tax rates is a \"betrayal\", and accused the chancellor of trying to dodge \"humiliation\" by asking Treasury Minister Dan Tomlinson to make the announcement.The Times reports that fake jobs are being sold to migrants for up to £20,000, as part of a fraudulent scheme to secure work visas and stay in the UK unlawfully. After the paper alerted the Home Office to its findings, the government said it would launch an \"urgent investigation\" into the scheme.The Express provides an update on the \"one in, one out\" migrant scheme in its main story, alleging that the policy has been called a \"total farce\". The paper says 350 asylum seekers have arrived in the UK over the past six months under the scheme, while just 281 migrants were returned to France.\"Starmer led 'witch-hunt' against Iraq veterans\" says the Telegraph, which says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer worked as the lead barrister on a 2007 human rights claim that \"reshaped the law governing troops in war zones\". According to the paper, the landmark case prompted years of criminal investigation into soldiers it says were wrongly accused - all at \"enormous cost\" to taxpayers. A spokesperson for Downing Street told the Telegraph that Sir Keir had not advocated for \"either side\" in the case, and his role had been to \"assist the court on points of law\". They added that the prime minister would \"never forget\" the sacrifices made by British servicemen and women.Tributes left outside the Iranian embassy in London feature prominently on the front page of the Guardian, which has focused in on \"Iran's hidden death toll\". After speaking to medics based in Iran, the paper says that deaths in the Middle Eastern country have exceeded 30,000, after a \"surge in regime brutality\".The Financial Times leads with discussions between the US and Ukraine on making a peace deal with Russia to end the war. It reports that US officials have indicated any security guarantees for Ukraine would be contingent on territorial concessions, and would probably see the nation forced to cede the contested Donbas region to the Kremlin. The paper says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hoped to sign documents on US security guarantees as early as this month.\"Run for the hills, Katie\" warns the Sun, focusing on model Katie Price's recent marriage to Lee Andrews in Dubai.\"Away at the races\" declares the Sun, leading on a Cheltenham-themed \"betting and beers\" package holiday in Benidorm.The Metro leads on a woman with a brain tumour who is suing the NHS, after she alleged she was treated with chemotherapy for more than six years despite only needing six months of the treatment.Several papers highlight Sir Keir Starmer's trip to China. The Daily Mirror goes with the headline \"the woo dynasty\", and says the prime minister will be on a \"charm offensive\" as he seeks \"growth-boosting ties with the world's second largest economy\".  In its analysis, the Daily Telegraph argues he is \"unlikely to find a pot of gold at the end of the Chinese rainbow\". The Sun's editorial says Britain should \"of course\" have a trade relationship with China but asks \"at what price?\". The Guardian says the prime minister has insisted the government remains \"clear-eyed\" about the national security threat posed by Beijing.\"Reeves puts nail in coffin of high street\" declares the Daily Mail on its front page. It says the chancellor is facing a \"growing backlash\" after restricting temporary help on business rates to pubs. The paper says the decision leaves \"thousands of small shops, restaurants and hotels facing crippling tax rises in April\". The Daily Express says the support is \"small beer\" for our high streets.The Times leads with an investigation into how criminal networks sell fake jobs to migrants to help them get work visas. The paper says in meetings with undercover reporters, agents explained how salaries would be paid to make jobs appear real - but that the money had to transferred back to a different bank account. The Home Office says it is \"investigating\" the \"illegal activity\", which it says \"will not be tolerated\".Several papers react to the government's announcement that leaseholder ground rents will be capped at £250 per year. The Financial Times carries a warning from a group representing 10 of the biggest landlords - which argues the change would \"seriously damage investor confidence in the housing market\". The i Paper argues that there's every chance the government's changes will make leasehold homes \"easier to sell - and worth more\".Pictures of Sir Keir Starmer wearing a pair of aviator sunglasses during a podcast interview feature widely. \"Flop gun\" says the Daily Star, which explains that he was handed the shades by the host, and then quipped \"bonjour\". The paper calls it a playful swipe at French President Emmanuel Macron who had been \"sporting sunnies\" because of a bloodshot eye.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "US technology giant Amazon has informed employees of a new round of global layoffs in an email apparently sent in error.A draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included as part of a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers late on Tuesday.In the email, Aubrey refers to a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to \"strengthen the company.\"The message, which has been seen by the BBC, was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.The title of the invitation was \"Send project Dawn email,\" an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job cuts.While the email made clear that layoffs were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed.\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the email said.\"Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.Amazon announced 14,000 job cuts in late October.This second round of layoffs had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former employee who asked not be identified.The broad understanding among employees had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, added the former employee, who left the company as part of the cuts in October.The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major round of layoffs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.While laid-off workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.Since 2022, major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft and others have slashed their workforces by laying off tens of thousands of people each year.Across the entire tech industry, an estimated 700,000 people have been laid off over the last four years, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts.So far this year, Facebook owner Meta has cut more roles, impacting several hundred employees. As has Pinterest, which this week cut around 700 jobs.Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of layoffs in 2023, 2024 and 2025.Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the CEO said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\" Jassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.",

    "body": "World number two Nelly Korda has called the lack of a mixed gender indoor virtual league \"an unbelievable miss\" following the launch of a women's competition backed by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.The WTGL will be held in the same Florida venue as the men's TGL, which is currently midway through its second season.Some of the world's best female golfers will compete in a season of team matchplay in the SoFi Center in Palm Beach Gardens, but Korda suggested not combining the men and women's events was a missed opportunity.\"I have mixed feelings on it, and I'm surprised no other girls have spoken out about it,\" she said.\"It's a huge and unbelievable miss that we're not playing alongside the men.\"There's no greater way to grow the game, and it would have been revolutionary. It would have been the first time, I think, that men and women are on the same playing field, playing for the same exact amount of money. \"But I also think it's great that we are getting this opportunity, so that's my mixed feelings.\"The indoor golf set-up features teams of players hitting shots at a five-storey-high simulator screen before moving to a short-game area with bunkers and a green that can rotate 360 degrees, creating hole-to-hole variations.Asked about the prospect of a mixed-gender event, Mike McCarley, a former TV executive who founded the TGL alongside McIlroy and Woods said the idea had been discussed.\"I think that is something that's interesting to us and is interesting to the LPGA and is interesting to a lot of the players we're talking to,\" said McCarley.\"Right now, we're really focused on building (the TGL) out and providing, frankly, a nice stage and really nice platform to showcase the players and their personalities.\"Korda, 27, is yet to commit to entering the event, saying she is \"still weighing out the time commitment\" required to play in the tournament.World number one Jeeno Thitikul and British golfers Charley Hull and Lottie Woad are among the players confirmed to compete.Atlanta Drive beat New York GC 4-3 to win the first  TGL title last year, with a prize pot of £10.39m being split between the two finalists.This season's competition, external began on 28 December, with a best-of-three final set to start on 23 March.The start date and prize pot for the women's competition is yet to be announced, beyond it being scheduled to take place in winter 2026-27.",

    "body": "Novak Djokovic's bid to make more tennis history is still alive as he scraped into the Australian Open semi-finals after Lorenzo Musetti retired injured when leading by two sets.Djokovic, aiming for a standalone record 25th Grand Slam singles title, was wayward, error-strewn and irritable against the inspired Italian in front of a stunned crowd.Musetti was 6-4 6-3 up and looked set for the semi-finals when he pulled up early in the third set.The fifth seed took a medical timeout for treatment on his thigh but, unable to serve or move properly, he walked to the net and shook hands at 3-1 down in the third.A heartbroken Musetti had to be helped down the corridor by a member of his team as he left the court.\"He was a far better player - I was on my way home tonight,\" the 38-year-old Serb great said.\"I don't know what to say except that I feel really sorry for him.\"I really wish him a speedy recovery. He should have been a winner today, there's no doubt.\"Djokovic received treatment for blisters on his feet at the end of the second set and could also have been tested physically had the match continued.It is another stroke of luck for Djokovic after fourth-round opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew before their match with injury.Djokovic has not won a set since his third-round victory over Botic van de Zandschulp on 24 January.For Djokovic to move ahead of Margaret Court's record of 24 major singles titles, he will need to limit his time on court, keep the points short and hope some good fortune goes his way.He has managed those so far - but he would not have anticipated reaching the semi-finals with such a heavy reliance on fortuity.Djokovic started sharply against Musetti, going an immediate break up, but then spectacularly lost his way.A dreadful miss on an overhead handed the break back to Musetti and Djokovic never recovered, sending down just one ace and committing 18 unforced errors to nine winners on his way to losing the first set.Djokovic frequently turned to his box in disbelief and annoyance - but he only had himself to blame at the start of the second set. After breaking Musetti and getting out to a 30-0 lead on serve, Djokovic hit five unforced errors in six points to hand the initiative back.Anchored by a one-handed backhand that kept Djokovic guessing and an improved serve, Musetti held off his opponent to move within touching distance of a first Australian Open semi-final.Musetti's level just made the injury all the more surprising. After being broken in the third set, he immediately called for the trainer and, after a valiant attempt at his next service game, called it quits.Djokovic had warm words for his opponent at the net and afterwards - and, having struggled with physical issues early in his career, would know how devastated the 23-year-old was.Despite the good fortune, Djokovic will know he will need to improve if he is to win an 11th Australian Open title, with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner potentially waiting in the last four.World number two Sinner, who beat Djokovic in the semi-finals two years ago, faces American eighth seed Ben Shelton later on Wednesday.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump said his administration was \"going to de-escalate a little bit\" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.\"Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,\" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.In early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend. Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota.Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as \"a very unfortunate incident\".Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump said: \"I haven't heard that.\"  Trump then added: \"He shouldn't have been carrying a gun.\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said shortly after the shooting that Pretti \"wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence,\" and accused him of \"domestic terrorism\". The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun during a confrontation. Eyewitnesses and local officials, however, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.Local authorities said the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed.A preliminary report drafted by Customs and Border Protection also appears to contradict the initial DHS account of events. It says two of its agents fired their weapons at Pretti.It does not mention that Pretti was reaching for his firearm, according to a copy of the report seen by the BBC's US partner CBS News.On Monday, the DHS pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. The department said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there.Homan posted on social media on Tuesday that he had met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials.Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region.In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying \"we took thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state, \"so they have good crime numbers.\"\"That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now,\" he said, before adding the administration would \"de-escalate\".Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House \"provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors\".\"We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol,\" Miller said in his statement to CNN.Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.\"The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend,\" Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his \"support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Ricketts said he expected \"a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident\".A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence.In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in-depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

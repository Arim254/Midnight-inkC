    "body": "Labour's workers' rights concessions to save businesses billions, assessment shows4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA series of concessions on Labour's flagship workers' rights reforms will save businesses billions of pounds, a government impact assessment shows.An initial analysis by officials found that implementing the party's measures to bolster workers' rights would cost firms up to £5bn a year.However, an updated analysis on Wednesday, which accounted for major concessions made by ministers, said it will now cost companies £1bn a year.The concessions were welcomed by business groups, but faced fierce criticism from some left-wing Labour MPs and union leaders.The Employment Rights Act will give workers access to sick pay and paternity leave from the first day on the job and introduce new protections for pregnant women and new mothers.In November, Labour dropped plans to give all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job. Instead, it will bring in enhanced protections after six months in employment, the bill's most significant measure.Alongside concessions on unfair dismissal, the government will phase in the overall package over several years, with many of the measures still subject to consultation and secondary legislation.The revised impact assessment also said the lower cost estimate reflected \"clearer implementation timelines\" and more available evidence about the policies.But the British Chambers of Commerce said the £1bn figure \"is likely to be a massive underestimate\".Policy director Kate Shoesmith said: \"The impact figure doesn't adequately account for the harder to quantify costs. Those include staff time for understanding and implementing new processes or explaining these to colleagues.\"Concessions such as introducing the six-month qualifying period will reduce costs – but not on the scale this latest assessment suggests.\"The latest impact assessment also said the Employment Rights Act would have a small positive impact on employment, boosting the amount of people in work by 0.1%.It also said the new measures could have a \"small, positive direct impact on economic growth\".Meanwhile, stronger workers' rights could benefit about 18 million workers, up from an earlier estimate of around 15 million, the analysis showed.Trade unions welcomed the latest impact assessment, saying it would bring \"significant benefits to UK workers, our economy and wider society\".The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said stronger rights at work are \"good for workers and employers – driving up labour market participation, improving health, raising productivity and boosting demand\".Its general secretary Paul Nowak called for ministers to \"finish the job as soon as possible\", warning that secondary legislation to bring in the measures must be \"watertight\".Mike Clancy, general secretary of the Prospect trade union, said: \"This impact assessment is clear that the Employment Rights Act is good for workers, good for growth, and good for wider society.\"The sensible compromises agreed between Government, businesses, and trade unions were intended to make this legislation more workable for all parties, while still delivering robust protections for workers, and this report clearly demonstrates the success of that approach.\"The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said the Employment Rights Act will \"transform the world of work, delivering stronger protections and higher living standards\".A spokesperson said: \"By making work pay, and more secure, this new analysis demonstrates how it will boost productivity, cut staff turnover, and put more money in the pockets of working people.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCMetro calls the US seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic a \"splash & grab\". President Donald Trump has \"gambled on another confrontation with the world\", it writes, adding that RAF aircraft aided American forces in the mission.The i Paper understands that the UK is \"ready to seize more\" of Putin's \"shadow ships\" on its own. The possible future missions would be intended to \"stop the illegal flow of oil\" and would be part of a growing \"grey war\". This refers to hostile action that doesn't meet the threshold of an all-out war.The US has said it will control Venezuelan crude oil sakes \"indefinitely\" on the same day that it seized the Russian tanker in the North Atlantic, the FT reports. This marks \"an escalation in Donald Trump's gambit to overhaul the global oil market\". The Times headlines: \"UK joins in the pursuit of Putin's shadow fleet\". Unnamed sources have told the paper that the UK had been aiding the US in planning the mission after it \"slipped through a maritime blockade of Venezuela\". The paper also highlights the \"crime spree\" committed by Met police officers who were not properly vetted.The Guardian also leads with the \"high-stakes Atlantic operation\", adding that a second vessel is \"said to be violating sanctions in Carribbean\".There is \"Kremlin fury\" over the UK's help in the tanker seizure operation, reports the Independent. The vessel was captured between Iceland and Scotland in a \"dramatic move that could put Donald Trump on a collision course with Vladimir Putin\", the paper says.The \"Badenoch blueprint to save our pubs\" leads the Daily Telegraph, as the Conservative leader pledges to abolish business rates for \"thousands of pubs\". The paper also reports on the Met Police vetting story.\"Don't run down clock on 'safe' right to die law\" says the Daily Express. Campaigners say that the House of Lords will cause \"significant harm\" to its reputation if peers don't pass the assisted dying legislation.\"You need to be on fat jabs for life\" writes the Daily Mail following the publication of a University of Oxford study. Most people using the injections will regain the weight they lose \"inside two years of stopping treatment\", it reports. Meanwhile there is \"shock\" as Claudia Winkleman reveals \"lovely\" secret traitor.\"Look who's Huw\" headlines the Sun as it heralds a new TV drama based on its investigation into former BBC News presenter Huw Edwards. Actor Martin Clunes will play the newsreader, who plead guilty to making indecent images of children in July 2024.The Daily Mirror calls for \"Jesy tests\" after the former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson spoke out about her babies' muscular condition SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). All newborns should be tested for the devastating condition, the paper writes.\"As Trump nabs oil ship\" the Daily Star speaks to farmers in Scotland - which it refers to as \"the UK's Greenland\". They tell \"golf nut Don\" that \"you can take our greens but not our land\". So there you go.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has called for US defence spending to be increased to $1.5tn (£1.1tn) in 2027 for what he called \"these very troubled and dangerous times\".That would be more than 50% higher than this year's $901bn budget, which was approved by Congress in December.\"This will allow us to build the \"Dream Military\" that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said on social media on Wednesday.In separate posts, the president said he would crack down on payouts to bosses and shareholders of major US defence contractors unless the firms speed up deliveries of armaments and build new manufacturing plants.Shares in major US defence equipment makers Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon rose by more than 5% in extended trading in New York trade after Trump made the announcements.Economists have previously warned that the gap between US spending and its income has reached unsustainable levels.But Trump said Washington can \"easily hit\" his proposed $1.5tn defence budget thanks to money being brought in by tariffs.Trump has been pushing for higher defence spending by the US and its allies since his first term in the White House.He said in another post on Wednesday that military equipment is not being made quickly enough and urged companies to build new and modern plants.Defence companies are issuing \"massive\" payouts to shareholders and stock buybacks at the expense of investing into production, Trump said. He also criticised the \"exorbitant\" pay packages of executives at arms manufacturers.\"No Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars which, as high as it sounds, is a mere fraction of what they are making now.\"In a separate post, Trump singled out Raytheon, saying it was the \"least responsive\" to America's defence needs and the slowest to increase production.\"Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with the Department of War,\" Trump wrote in a separate post.The BBC has contacted Raytheon for comment.Trump's call for much higher defence spending comes as geo-political tensions have increased around the world.On Wednesday, the US military captured a Russian-flagged oil tanker suspected to have violated US sanctions.It came after US forces seized Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the weekend and took him to America to face drug trafficking charges.In December, China held military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.",

    "body": "Russian attacks left Ukraine's southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia almost entirely without power, the country's energy ministry said on Wednesday night. Critical infrastructure was \"operating on reserve power\", it said in a statement on Telegram, while officials said water supplies and the internet were also disrupted. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter.\"Ukraine's energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat,\" Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram.\"Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure,\" she said.The disruptions to power and heating have come as temperatures plunge. \"Emergency restoration work in the regions affected by the attack will begin immediately as soon as the security situation allows,\" state energy company Ukrenergo said on Telegram. It added: \"The primary task of energy workers is to restore critical infrastructure.\"Dnipro city Mayor Borys Filatov said on Telegram all city hospitals had been completely switched to generators. \"There are the necessary water supplies, the treatment process does not stop. Water drainage in houses is also supported by alternative power sources,\" Filatov said.School holidays had been extended until 9 January because of the power cuts, he added. The head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, said everything possible was being done to restore power.\"At this time, water utility workers have almost restored water to our homes, despite the fact that there is a complete blackout in the region,\" Fedorov said in a video message published on Telegram.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.The attacks come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.Following talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a \"legitimate target\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoVanessa ClarkeEducation reporterGCSE students across England will be able to view their exams results on their phones for the first time in August.An \"education record\" app, trialled with 95,000 pupils in Manchester and the West Midlands last summer, will initially download the results - and also allow Year 11 students to then store a digital record of those results for future use, such as when applying for jobs or further education.However students will still be encouraged to go into school on results day to receive \"advice or support\", headteachers say.One incentive to do so is that while the traditional brown envelopes containing the much-anticipated grades will still be available to collect in person from 08:00 on results day, the new app will not get its update until 11:00.The app will also hold information for schools and colleges on whether students have special educational needs and disabilities, or are eligible for free school meals.The Department for Education estimates the rollout could save schools and colleges up to £30m a year in administrative costs because of the costs and time currently involved in sharing information that now every teenager will be able to show on request at subsequent stages in their education.\"No student should have to rifle through drawers looking for a crumpled certificate when they're preparing for a job interview,\" Skills Minister Baroness Jacqui Smith said.\"This app will give young people instant access to their results whenever they need them while freeing up teachers and college staff from unnecessary paperwork.\"Schools are being encouraged to sign up so pupils can download and set up the app before the summer results day.Almost all of the students at Meadow Park School in Coventry, which took part in the pilot during the summer, still came into school on results day to pick up their brown envelopes according to headteacher Bernadette Pettman. \"The traditional brown envelope moment is still an important milestone for students, it's a chance to see friends, celebrate together, and connect with staff,\" Pettman told the BBC. Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was important for young people to have an accessible record of their achievements but stressed that students should still collect exam results in person.\"This face-to-face contact not only allows them to celebrate with peers and teachers, but also to receive any advice or support they may require regarding next steps.\"\"We are sure that school and college leaders will also welcome the administrative savings made possible as a result of this change, although this will only amount to a drop in the ocean compared to the funding pressures they remain under,\" he added.Students in Scotland, where there is a different set of exams for pupils at 16, have been able to get their results through an online app since 2019.In Wales and Northern Ireland, where pupils sit GCSEs but the education system is politically devolved, no changes to the results prodecure have been announced.Exams themselves do continue to evolve. Last month the exams watchdog in England, Ofqual, announced that around eight GCSE and A-level exams could switch from the traditional pen-and-paper method to on-screen assessments from 2030.Teachers, exam boards and parents are being asked for their views on that proposal.Ofqual's chief regulator Sir Ian Bauckham says any changes to exams would have to be fair, fully tested and top quality.Additional reporting by Rahib Khan",

    "body": "10 hours agoJacob PanonsSouth EastGetty ImagesThe new offence came into force under the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration ActA teenager believed to be the first person to be charged with endangering others during a sea crossing to the UK without valid entry clearance said he was \"forced to do so\".Aman Naseri, 18, is accused of piloting a small boat with 46 people on board during the first Channel crossing of the year on 5 January, the day the new law came into force.At Margate Magistrates' Court on Wednesday he pleaded not guilty to the offence.Naseri, who is an Afghan national and followed proceedings through a Dari interpreter, has been remanded into custody to appear at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday.Julie Farbrace, prosecuting, said: \"We submit Mr Naseri has piloted a boat across the Channel. \"There were 46 other people on that boat and that by piloting the boat he put them in danger.\"The Crown Prosecution Service said Naseri was the first person to be charged with the offence, which is part of a range of measures introduced to limit Channel crossings on small boats.New offenceThe new offence came into force under the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act, which became law in December.According to the Home Office, the charge of endangering others during a sea crossing is to stop more people being crammed into unsafe boats and would apply to those involved in physical aggression and intimidation, as well as anyone who resists rescue.When the plans for the offence were first announced in January 2025, Home Office sources said there had been instances of \"floating crime scenes\" where people had acted in such a reckless way people died on board in crushes and drownings.The new charge could include physical or psychological injury, and covers journeys by water to the UK from France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Under the offence, those who endanger or risk another life at sea could face up to six years in prison.Boat supplier jailedIn a separate case a man who supplied thousands of small boats and engines to people smugglers has been jailed. Adem Savas, a Turkish national, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and received a fine of €400,000 (£346,000) on Wednesday, after admitting to offences of people smuggling and being a member of an organised crime group.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was thought he had made millions from the operation and described Savas as without a doubt the most significant supplier\" to gangs behind the dangerous crossings between 2019 and 2024.An NCA spokesperson said equipment supplied by Savas is thought to have been used in about half the Channel crossings in 2023. Savas was sentenced at a court in Bruges, Belgium, after a joint operation between the NCA and Belgian authorities, having been arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport in November 2024.Additional reporting from PA Media.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoNoor Nanji & Zoe ConwayBBC NewsA group of trade unions has alleged McDonald's has violated international labour standards by failing to tackle sexual harassment in its UK restaurants and franchises.It comes after a BBC investigation exposed a toxic culture at the fast-food chain in which workers, some as young as 17, were being groped and harassed. Last year, McDonald's staff told us they still faced sexual abuse and harassment.The unions complained to an independent unit within government which has now offered to intervene by mediating between the unions and McDonald's.The fast-food chain said it was \"reviewing the information and considering next steps\".The complaint from trade unions was referred to the UK National Contact Point (NCP) - an independent unit which sits with the Department for Business and Trade, run by a mix of civil servants and external advisors.After conducting an initial assessment, the UK NCP has decided the complaint merits further consideration and will now offer mediation to both parties.McDonald's - A toxic workplace for teenagers?The group of five trade unions, including the Bakers Union and the TUC, alongside the Corporate Justice Coalition, state that their complaint - which was lodged in February 2024 - was prompted by the BBC's investigation.The complaint said there had been \"further evidence of persistent, deeply rooted gender-based discrimination\" in McDonald's restaurants, in breach of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.It described \"repeated episodes\" of harassment against McDonald's workers, \"most of them teenagers\". It also accuses managers of failing to stop such behaviour.The Department of Business and Trade said its decision to accept the complaint is not a finding against McDonald's. It also said it does not mean that it considers that the company has acted inconsistently with OECD guidelines.It said the mediation offer is voluntary and if any party declines to take part, the UK NCP will conduct a further examination of the complaint.Ian Hodson, president of the Bakers Union, said the stories exposed in the BBC investigation were \"horrific\" and had \"helped to shine a light on workplace harassment\".\"The most important thing to me is the workers,\" he told BBC News. \"Their voices need to be heard. Everyone deserves the right to be safe when they go to work.\"Luise Schroter, senior policy officer at the Corporate Justice Coalition, said harassment at McDonald's \"must end\".\"Workers and their unions are key to ending these systemic abuses and must not be sidelined,\" she said.McDonald's workers speak out over sexual abuse claimsMcDonald's workers make fresh harassment claimsMcDonald's abuse: MeToo hasn’t helped these teenage workersAfter the initial BBC investigation, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.But since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations, while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.Last January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.More than 700 current and former junior employees are now taking legal action against the firm.Kiran Daurka, employment partner at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing the workers, says their clients accuse McDonald’s of failing to protect them.In November, the equality watchdog said McDonald's would bring in new sexual harassment training for managers in strengthened measures agreed with it to protect its staff from abuse.At the time, McDonald's said it welcomed the new measures, adding that they would \"build on the significant progress we have already made in this space\".Responding to the latest developments, a McDonald's spokesperson said: \"We are aware of the NCP's initial assessment and continue to engage constructively with the OECD process.\"We are reviewing the information and considering next steps.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoJess WarrenLondonPA MediaTwo serial rapists were among 131 officers and staff in the Metropolitan Police who committed crimes or misconduct after they were not properly vetted, a review has found.David Carrick, one of the UK's worst sex offenders, and Cliff Mitchell, who carried out a \"campaign of rape\" on two victims, were among the police officers who were not properly checked.The cases were revealed in a vetting review of the 10 years up to the end of March 2023. Other serious crimes committed by officers and staff included drug use, violent attacks and affray.Assistant Commissioner Rachel Williams acknowledged that the \"public will be really concerned\" by the lapse in vetting procedures.She added that the report was part of \"ongoing work to demand the highest standards across the Met\".Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Abandoning vetting checks on officers was a dereliction of the Met's duty to keep London safe.\"I have asked the Chief Inspector of Constabulary to carry out an inspection as I seek to restore trust in the force's ability to protect and serve the public.\"Met PoliceCliff Mitchell is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of nearly 18 years after committing more than 50 sex attacksCarrick, who was given 37 life sentences for his crimes, was not properly vetted in 2017, with checks failing to reveal an allegation of domestic abuse against him.Mitchell was allowed to join the force in 2020 after a vetting panel, which partly aimed to improve diversity, overturned a decision to reject him from the police despite a previous accusation of raping a child.The review published on Thursday found that thousands of police officers and staff were not properly checked amid pressure during a national recruitment drive from July 2019 to March 2023.Senior officers at the Met chose not to meet national guidelines amid a scramble to find more than 4,500 recruits.The deviations from standard practice meant thousands of references were not checked, and shortcuts in vetting led to there being some officers and staff who should not have been in the force. This contributed to \"police-perpetrated harm\" and damaged public trust, the review said.Under the Police Uplift Programme, forces in England and Wales were expected to recruit 20,000 officers within three and a half years to replace those cut during austerity, and funding was ringfenced and lost if targets were not met.Hertfordshire PoliceDavid Carrick was already serving multiple life sentences when he was convicted last year of further sex attacks\"Senior leaders embarked on an assertive approach towards hiring and vetting practices in order to meet what would become unachievable recruitment targets and grow the Metropolitan Police Service's (MPS) workforce at pace,\" the report stated. \"The focus appeared to be on speed and output; this unintentionally compromised integrity.\"The report said 5,073 officers and staff were not properly vetted, of whom 4,528 had no Special Branch vetting checks, 431 had no Ministry of Defence checks and 114 had a vetting refusal overturned by a Met internal panel. Another 3,338 who were due for vetting renewal underwent only limited checks.The Met estimated that about 1,200 people who joined the force may have had their vetting refused under normal practices, out of around 27,300 applications.Separately, 17,355 officers and staff did not have their references properly checked, if at all, between 2018 and April 2022.The Met has not checked each of these files, but estimates that about 250 of these employees would not have got a job if their references had been checked.'Farcical situation'The review found that senior officers had faced political pressure and had to meet recruitment targets or lose funding to other forces.The report concluded: \"There were deviations from policy and practice, overconfidence in the ability to recruit at scale and lack of resources in vetting increased risk.\"PA MediaSir Mark Rowley took up the role of Met Police Commissioner in September 2022 Since Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley took on the UK's top policing job in September 2022, about 1,500 officers have been sacked in what has been dubbed as a clean-up of the force.Williams said: \"In publishing this report today, we are being open and transparent about past vetting and recruitment practices that led, in some cases, to unsuitable people joining the Met.\"We have been honest with Londoners on many occasions about previous shortcomings in our professional standards approach. \"We found that some historical practices did not meet the strengthened hiring and vetting standards we have today. We identified these issues ourselves and have fixed them quickly while making sure any risk to the public has been properly and effectively managed.\"She added: \"The Met recruits hundreds of officers and staff every year, the overwhelming majority of exemplary character who are dedicated to protecting the public.\"Paula Dodds, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \"Today's report illustrates a farcical situation in which hitting a numerical target of recruits has taken precedence over normal checks and balances.\"The good, brave and hard-working colleagues we represent are the first to say that the small minority of officers who are not fit to serve should not be in the police service.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoGabriela Pomeroy,Alicia CurryandAdrienne Murray,in CopenhagenMia ChemnitzMia Chemnitz says \"the people of Greenland do not want to become American\"\"The people of Greenland do not want to become American,\" Mia Chemnitz tells the BBC. \"We are not for sale.\"The 32-year-old business owner in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk reflects the sentiments of many who spoke to the BBC about how they felt about recent rhetoric from the Trump administration.The White House has said it was \"actively\" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary.This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere.This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move.Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next.\"That's when it stopped feeling abstract,\" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work.\"For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us.\"Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are \"a clear threat\" that she was \"appalled\" by.\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she says.Tupaarnaq KopeckTupaarnaq Kopeck says the military intervention in Venezuela made the abstract feel realGreenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline.But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War 2. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks.More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.\"It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,\" says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\"The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.\"Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance.After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying its future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for.But she worries this will matter little to the US \"if it's not backed with consequences and actions\".\"As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?\"Tupaarnaq says: \"Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly.\"Aleqatsiaq PearyAleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter says a US takeover would just \"replace one occupier with another\"The Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option.Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen.This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he says. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"But he says: \"I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,\" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".For Sermitsiaq editor Masaana, the rhetoric from the US is pushing a fallacious binary choice.\"We really have to try to avoid getting the story going to a place where it's Greenland that has to decide between the US and Denmark, because that is not the choice that the Greenlandic people want.\"Christian KeldsenChristian Keldsen says \"people in Greenland are getting really irritated with this\"For others, who see the strong relationship Greenland already has with the US being soured, there is a clear sense of indignation.\"People in Greenland are getting really irritated with this,\" says Christian Keldsen of the Greenland Business Association.\"Greenlanders are welcoming and open-hearted, it's the best thing about the country. But now with this, some people are scared.\"Greenland is open for business with the US, Christian stresses, noting that there are new direct flights from Greenland to New York - a sure sign \"they don't need to take us over\".\"We are a well-functioning democracy and our government has a strong mandate,\" Mia says. \"We are a Nato ally and the US has had military bases in Greenland for over 70 years - and still has the right to establish and run new and more.\"As it has been stated from Greenland before: we are not for sale, but we're open for business.\"",

    "body": "Just nowSakshi VenkatramanWatch: Police chief describes how Minneapolis shooting unfoldedA US immigration agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman in the city of Minneapolis, sparking a war of words as local officials rejected the Trump administration's account that it was self-defence. The Department of Homeland Security said the woman, Renee Nicole Good, was a \"violent rioter\" who tried to run over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.But Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said \"this was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying\", telling ICE officials in expletive-laced remarks to leave the city.Hundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to the city as part of the White House's nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.Videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning.From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement. Law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.Three pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked along the street nearby. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote. The Republican president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\".Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said Good was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, \"and she began to drive off\".Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says he will not seek re-electionTrump administration says it's withholding childcare funds from Minnesota amid fraud allegationsAmericast: How did a YouTuber stop federal funding to Minnesota?US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was \"stalking and impeding\" officers throughout the day and tried to \"weaponise her vehicle\" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\".The federal agent fired \"defensive shots\" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.She said the same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June. Noem added that ICE operations in the city would continue in the city, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.The Minneapolis City Council, however, said that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbours\" when she was shot and killed.Getty ImagesLaw enforcement surrounds the area where an ICE agent fatally shot a woman in MinneapolisMinnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.  \"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. \"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"Top Democrats, like former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\".Protests and arrests took place in several parts of the city as some outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. The main gathering was near the scene of the shooting, which is only about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered by a city police officer, which led to worldwide anti-racism protests.Protests were being organised in other US cities, including New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.Minneapolis Public Schools announced that classes were cancelled for the rest of the week, \"due to safety concern\". It comes after federal agents reportedly made arrests outside a high school on Wednesday.Why is ICE in Minneapolis?The Trump administration deployed an additional 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in response to allegations of welfare fraud in the state.The mayor said in the press conference that ICE was not making the city safer. \"They're ripping families apart, they're sowing chaos in our streets,\" he said.The deployment, which began on Sunday, is one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in a US city in recent years.It follows an immigration enforcement campaign launched by ICE late last year to target individuals in Minneapolis who were issued deportation orders, including members of the city's Somali community.That community has been criticised frequently by Trump, who has called them \"garbage\".\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president has said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"Trump later doubled-down on his remarks after a YouTube video by a conservative online content creator accused daycare centres run by Somali immigrants of mass fraud. In response, Trump has withheld federal childcare funds to the state of Minnesota.The Trump administration has sent ICE agents to other cities as well, all part of a widespread crackdown on what it says is unlawful immigration in the US.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmily HoltBBCKristina and Laura have written a book titled 'All the Cool Girls Get Fired' about their experiences. The new year is a natural time to reflect, and for many of us, that involves thinking about our careers. Kristina O'Neill and Laura Brown are both editors who lost their jobs after restructures, and they initially thought it was the end of the world.\"I poured my heart into the role... I believed in the values we promoted. Yet, when it came to me, those values weren't there,\" says Laura. They both chose to use the word fired after they lost their roles and say being open about it can help you deal with what's happened.\"There are so many euphemisms that we all use for losing our jobs. But the faster you own it, the faster you're honest about it, the faster you can move on.\"That's the fast track to whatever you want to do next,\" adds Laura.Now, they are thriving in new jobs, with Laura owning her own media company and Kristina editor in chief for Sotheby's magazine. If you've lost your job or are simply looking for a new career, here are four ways to help.1. Reflect on the past year Getty ImagesIt's natural to feel a bit low about work if  you've had a break over the festive period.Sarah Ellis, co-founder of careers website, Squiggly Careers and Amazing If, says it is important to reflect on the past year before diving into a new job search. She encourages people to think about what they want to do more or less of, and what inspires or drains their energy. Looking back through your successes to find common themes can help too. \"Try not to just look at the last month, because we all have a bit of recency bias that can get in the way,\" she adds.Laura says it is also important to decide where your work sits in your life.  This involves being honest about how much time you're working and its impact on your social and family life.After losing her role, she advises not letting your life be defined by your work.2. Take small steps Getty ImagesSarah says people can make small steps towards a career change without diving in head first. She took seven years to make the jump from her corporate career to running her own company full time, working on her project alongside her job, which meant she could pay herself from the start. \"It took a bit longer, but that was how I did it in a sustainable way\", she says. Sarah recommends a \"try before you buy\" approach.This could be volunteer work, getting involved in a work project that interests you, or saying yes to something different within your existing team.\"Worst case scenario, you don't like that area, but it's better to know now than to know when you've made the move,\" she says. Sarah also encourages looking into small \"bridging roles\". These may not be ideal, but serve as a step in the right direction, such as a role which has similarities to the career you want, but not in the exact industry.\"It's giving yourself space to say this is good for now, but that isn't the same as forever.\"That can be a really smart strategy for getting much closer to that career change.\"3. Remember your achievementsGetty ImagesIf you've recently lost your job, you aren't alone - redundancies have surged to their highest rate since 2021, official figures indicate.Laura was editor in chief of a style magazine, but in 2022 herself and her team were laid off after her firm closed the print version of the magazine.  Understanding this did not mean she wasn't good at her job helped her process the change. \"What you've learned doesn't go away because you lost your job.\"Don't give your power up, it's important for everybody to remember their own value.\"Kristina was fired after a 10-year spell at a financial magazine after a regime change at the top and the arrival of a new editor. She stresses that so much of the shame of being fired is \"in your head\". \"In the US, especially hundreds of thousands of people being laid off, it's not personal. It's likely very much not you, so don't take that ball of shame and carry it around.\"4. Create a career check-list Getty ImagesIf you're desperately looking for work or utterly miserable in your current role, it can be tempting to dive straight into applying for any job - ignoring personal happiness. But Sarah says this is a big mistake.Instead, she suggests an exercise called \"scanning\" - narrowing your search down to job descriptions that sound interesting to you.She recommends going through websites like LinkedIn, and gathering around 10 to 15 that you like the look of.  \"What are the words that keep coming up?\" she says. \"Because [these] will give you some clues as to the things that matter most to you.Through this, you can create your own career check list, and avoid wasting time on ill-fitting applications.Laura stresses it's also important to think about what has made you happy and unhappy over the course of your career. \"It may not be what you can do all the time, but it could be something that's lit up in you, that you've forgotten,\" she says.

    "body": "I would have been selfish not to share twins' muscle disease diagnosis, Jesy Nelson says15 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterKen McKay/ITV/ShutterstockSinger Jesy Nelson has pledged to \"shout from the rooftops\" to campaign for all babies to get tested for a rare muscle disease at birth.The former Little Mix star recently discovered her seven-month-old daughters have Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and will \"probably never walk\", but the condition isn't included in screening for newborn babies.\"That's what's frustrating,\" she told ITV's This Morning on Wednesday. \"If this was the card I was always going to get dealt and there was nothing I could do about it, then it's almost easier for me to accept.\"But when you know that there is something that can be done about it, and it is life changing to your child, that's the part that I cannot accept.\"The singer became emotional as she told presenters Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard her life had \"completely changed\" since the diagnosis.Nelson, 34, has called for SMA to be part of an NHS blood test that is normally carried out at five days old, and currently tests for 10 other conditions.Speaking days after she posted a video on social media announcing her twins' condition, Nelson said: \"I have this platform, and I almost feel like I've got a duty of care to raise awareness about it.\"And a little part of me feels, and I don't know if this is even crazy to say this, I feel selfish to keep this to myself and not potentially save a child's life.\"Nelson added she has had to rapidly learn how to look after her daughters Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster.\"It's just so much to deal with whilst you're also trying to deal with this horrendous thing that's just happened.\"The singer said doing that while also simply trying to be their mum was \"the part that I'm still struggling with\", and was comforted by Deeley as she became emotional. \"I won't lie. The part that really gets me, is I just want to be their mum, I don't want to be a nurse.\"So it's hard, but, yeah, I just want to reiterate that if this is caught [diagnosed] from birth, it's just life changing.\"'They are still smiling'She added that it \"makes me so sad\" to watch back videos of her girls and now be able to spot the signs that their legs were gradually moving less during their first weeks.\"That's how quick it is. And that is why it is so important and vital to get treatment from birth, and it is detected from birth,\" she said.The girls have now had treatment in the form of a one-off infusion, she explained.\"It essentially puts the gene back in their body that they don't have. It stops any of the muscles that are still working from dying.\"But any that have gone, you can't regain them. That's why if you catch it early [it's better]. Now it will just be down to a case of constant physio.\"She continued: \"We've been told that they will probably never walk. They'll probably never regain their neck strength. They are going to be in wheelchairs.\"But there have been so many stories where parents have been told this, and their children have gone on to do incredible things. So I believe that you've just got to manifest this into existence.\"They are still smiling. They're still happy. They have each other, and that's the main thing that I'm like so grateful for, because they could be doing this by themselves, but they're twins and they're going through this together, and I think it's beautiful.\"So all I can do is just try my best to be there for them, give them positive energy, keep doing physio.\"On Tuesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV News that Nelson was \"right to challenge and criticise how long it takes to get a diagnosis\".He said he was \"determined to look not just at screening for SMA, but to make much better use of genomic medicine\".In 2021, a life-changing gene therapy drug called Zolgensma was approved by the NHS to treat babies with the disease.According to the charity SMA UK, the drug delivers a healthy copy of the affected gene to the body, but timing is critical because irreversible damage may have already occurred in the nervous system.Scotland will start routinely screening babies for SMA from the spring, and the National Screening Committee is currently reviewing whether to introduce it across the UK.Nelson added her voice to a campiagn by SMA UK to introduce routine screening to the NHS newborn blood spot test, which currently looks for conditions including cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and a range of inherited metabolic diseases, but not SMA.An NHS spokesperson said three new treatments for SMA had been rolled out since 2019, helping hundreds of children.\"The UK National Screening Committee is looking at whether the NHS should introduce routine screening to identify the condition in early life via a heel prick blood test – and the NHS is supporting further evaluation to inform the Committee's decision.\"The Generation Study is also evaluating whether genomic sequencing could be adopted more widely as part of standard newborn screening in the NHS, including testing for SMA.\"",

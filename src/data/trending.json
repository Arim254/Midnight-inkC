Why did Pam Bondi, US Attorney General, lose her temper during Epstein Files questioning?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIn fiery congressional hearings last week, US Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the justice department's handling of the Epstein files. Several of Epstein's victims watched heated exchanges as Bondi faced a range of questions, including whether the files were sufficiently redacted, Trump’s role, Ghislaine Maxwell’s prison treatment and whether the Attorney General had met with victims. \nJustin, Marianna, Sarah and Anthony also discuss the difficulties for survivors of Epstein’s abuse in obtaining successful prosecutions and self identifying perpetrators.  Plus, why have Bill and Hillary Clinton insisted on giving their evidence publicly on what they did and didn’t know about Epstein’s abuse.  Both deny any wrongdoing, and Hillary Clinton makes clear she never met Epstein.\nAnd, Barack Obama appeared to confirm the existence of aliens on a podcast. The former president later took to Instagram to row back his remarks, clarifying he saw ‘no evidence’ of extraterrestrials during his tenure.

    "body": "19 minutes agoRobert GreenallGetty ImagesSpanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.He was detained while staying at a Madrid hotel, where he is accused of having racked up more than €20,000 of losses during several stays.Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system, and was the first of its kind to be detected.Their investigation began after suspicious activity was reported by a travel booking site. It took just four days to complete - the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyber attack, getting the system to authorise his transaction after entering only one cent as the charged amount.Police said that the transaction had at first appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount - €0.01 - to the hotel company.Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His latest stay there was for four nights, normally costing €4,000. They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.The police statement appears to suggest that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were given.ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.",

    "body": "52 minutes agoAdam EleyBBC NewsGetty ImagesA Supreme Court ruling is likely to lead to significantly higher damages being awarded to children injured by medical negligence.Until now, children have only been entitled to compensation for lost earnings – pay missed out on by not being able to work – for the years they are expected to live.But the court, ruling on the case of a child who sustained a brain injury at birth, found that compensation should take into account the full working life she would have had if she had not been harmed at birth.The decision could have large cost implications for the NHS. Across all medical negligence cases in England, not just those involving children, it paid out £3.1bn in compensation in 2024-25.The child at the centre of this case, born in 2015 at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, is not being named.During labour, monitoring indicated that her heartbeat was abnormal, but this was not acted on.She was born with signs of oxygen deprivation, required resuscitation and later scans confirmed a severe hypoxic brain injury.The Trust admitted failures in her care. The girl has severe cerebral palsy, is unable to walk or talk, has severe visual impairment and epilepsy, and requires continuous 24-hour care.In 2023, the High Court awarded a lump sum of £6,866,615 and an additional payment of £394,940 per year, linked to inflation. This was to cover the cost of her care needs and for loss of earnings up to the age of 29, her life expectancy.Wednesday's Supreme Court verdict, by a majority, has ruled that compensation should take into account her entire loss of earnings and pension for a full working life.It said that the Trust and the family's lawyers were agreed that had the girl not been injured, she would have enjoyed a normal life expectancy, obtained GCSEs, worked until aged 68 and received a pension.The additional damages will now be decided on at a later date - lawyers for the family claim it amounts to more than £800,000.Family 'elated'The girl's mother said in a statement that she felt \"elated that my little girl has changed the law and that this will help lots of other children who have been injured through no fault of their own\". The ruling brings the law in cases involving children into line with adolescents and adults that have suffered life-shortening injuries, who were already able to claim for 'lost years'.The court found there was \"no basis in law\" for injured children to have their claims treated differently.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoKali HaysTechnology reporterEPA/ShutterstockMark Zuckerberg, the Facebook co-founder and owner of Instagram, will appear in a California court on Wednesday in a landmark legal case over whether social media is addictive to children.It will mark Zuckerberg's first testimony before a jury after years of backlash against his company, Meta Platforms, which also owns WhatsApp. Lawyers for Meta have argued the lead plaintiff in this case, known by her initials K.G.M, was hurt by other things in her life and not by her use of Instagram.The Los Angeles hearing, in which Google's YouTube is also a defendant, is being closely watched for its implications for thousands of similar lawsuits facing social media giants.TikTok and Snapchat, which had also been named in the lawsuit, settled shortly before trial was scheduled to begin. Terms of the settlements were not disclosed.Zuckerberg is expected to face questions about Instagram's design and what changes the firm made over the years in order to attract users.Meta's advertising-based business model, which depends on metrics such as how long people stay on the platforms, is also likely to be in focus. In questioning last week, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, challenged the idea of social media addiction, arguing that even 16-hours of Instagram use in a single day did not show an addiction.The trial is expected to last several weeks. It is also set to include testimony from former Meta employees who have since spoken out about on the company's practices.YouTube boss Neal Mohan had also been expected to appear but is no longer being called for testimony, the BBC has learned.The case is one of thousands of similar lawsuits brought by families, state prosecutors and school districts currently winding their way through US courts.The lawsuits have accuse Meta and other social media platforms, including TikTok, Snapchat and Youtube, of functioning in an addictive manner that ultimately has harmed many children.In one such case, 29 state attorney generals are pushing a California federal court to demand that the platforms make a number of changes immediately, before any trial, including forcing Meta to remove all accounts known to belong to users under 13 years of age.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesA shortage in medical cement is likely to lead to delays in some patients getting joint surgery, NHS bosses say.It comes after Heraeus Medical, the main supplier of bone cement to the health service, has had to temporarily halt production at its main site for two months.The German firm supplies about three-quarters of the bone cement needed in the NHS. The product is used in about 1,000 operations a week, mostly in knee replacements, but also in some hip and shoulder replacements.Hospitals are being told to prioritise emergency patients ahead of those on the waiting list.These are likely to be older patients who have suffered falls and those with broken hips.Currently there are 850,000 patients on the waiting list in England requiring planned treatment to their joints – the largest of any speciality.Guidance from NHS England calls on hospitals to focus on providing care to those in the most pain or with the most complex conditions.Hospitals have about two weeks supply of bone cement in stock.NHS England and counterparts in the rest of the UK are seeking to increase supplies from four other manufacturers that supply the NHS.'Crushing blow'Deborah Alsina, chief executive of Arthritis UK, said: \"This is a crushing blow for those individuals who have finally made it to the front of the orthopaedic surgery queue after a long time waiting.\"We urge hospitals to communicate quickly with those affected to avoid additional worry and uncertainty.\"Aside from the personal toll on people with arthritis, the stakes are high for government who have an uphill challenge to bring down waiting lists to meet ambitious targets.\"In a letter to its customers, Heraeus Medical said it had experienced a critical machine failure at its main site when it was in the process of upgrading its production processes.An NHS England spokesman said the problem was affecting supply globally.\"The NHS is issuing immediate guidance to hospitals to ensure trauma and urgent care can safely continue, enable the use of alternative suppliers where possible and to support prioritisation of orthopaedic waiting lists based on patients' needs over the coming weeks.\"NHS England said it was working closely with government and leading professional bodies to ensure that effective care could be provided while supply is resolved.It also said it wants to reduce delays for patients requiring less urgent care as far as possible.Fergal Monsell, of the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA), which represents joint surgeons, said his organisation was working with NHS bosses to limit the impact on patients.He said it was likely hospitals would start using surgeons and theatres more to carry out operations that do not require bone cement.\"The BOA will update surgeons with developments so they can treat their patients as the situation develops,\" he added.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAFPA feminist anti-immigration group said Quentin Deranque had been helping to protect its members in LyonTwo more people have been detained by French authorities investigating the killing of a far-right student activist by suspected radical left militants in Lyon, bringing the total in custody to 11.Quentin Deranque, 23, suffered a fatal brain injury when he was beaten and kicked during a demonstration last week on the sidelines of a conference held by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for hard-left party France Unbowed (LFI).The wave of arrests began on Wednesday, and included a parliamentary assistant to LFI politician Raphaël Arnault.Arnault said his assistant, Jacques-Elie Favrot, had halted all his work in parliament and his contract was being terminated.Even before his arrest, Favrot's lawyer said he formally denied responsibility for the activist's death and was unable to continue his duties because of death threats.Although the radical left party leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon has sought to distance the party from Deranque's violent death, LFI has come under attack from rivals across the political spectrum, less than a month before France votes in key municipal elections.The political climate is febrile ahead of the vote - seen as the last test of public opinion before next year's presidential elections. Within the past month Sébastien Lecornu's minority government had to survive two no-confidence motions to push through this year's budget.LFI party co-ordinator Manuel Bompard announced on Wednesday that the party's Paris HQ was briefly evacuated because of a bomb threat, and went on to accuse a large cross-section of the political and media classes of making days of false and defamatory statements.\"I call for an end to this absolutely despicable exploitation of the tragedy that took place last Thursday evening in Lyon, for which France Unbowed bears absolutely no responsibility,\" he told reporters. \"This climate should worry everybody.\"AFPThe attack last Thursday took place a short distance from Sciences Po university in LyonVideos captured from the scene show three people lying on the ground coming under attack from a larger group, all of them wearing hoods.A feminist anti-immigration group called Némésis said Deranque had been outside the venue to protect its members. Némésis has blamed Young Guard for the attack - an allegation it denies. Government spokesperson Maud Bregeon has urged the party to suspend Arnault from its parliamentary group because of the MP's links to Anti-Fascist Young Guard, which has been blamed for the violence a short distance from  Sciences Po University in Lyon.A minute's silence was held in the National Assembly on Tuesday for the young activist, and politicians lined up to criticise the radical-left leader and his colleagues.Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally said Mélenchon had \"moral and political responsibility\" for what had happened and even former LFI MP Alexis Corbière called on the party to take stock politically of what had happened.Sébastien Lecornu said that \"without undermining the presumption of innocence\" LFI had to \"clean up\" its statements, ideas and its ranks fast.Mélenchon hit back, saying he refused to take lessons from Lecornu.However, more moderate figures on the left such as Socialist ex-President François Hollande have accused LFI of being responsible for lowering the tone of politics in France.\"It's clear there can be no alliance in the municipal elections between the Socialists or reformist left-wing parties and LFI in the second round,\" Hollande said on Wednesday. \"The relationship is over.\"For months the party had indulged in a kind of \"brutalisation\" of debate so there was no political space between the far left and far right, said Hollande.The actions of police have also come in for criticism, as local forces were warned that Rima Hassan's event was due to take place but riot police were not on the scene at the time of the fatal attack.",

    "body": "'I don't pay attention': Cynthia Erivo ignores online criticism as Dracula gets mixed reviews6 hours agoYasmin RufoNoël Coward Theatre, LondonDaniel BoudAfter years defying gravity, Wicked star Cynthia Erivo has traded the shimmering world of Oz for something darker and far more demanding. On the stage at London's Noël Coward Theatre, Erivo stands alone, carrying an entire gothic epic on her shoulders in a new adaptation of Dracula. There are no flying monkeys or emerald cities here. Instead, the actress alone carries a two-hour theatrical marathon, playing 23 characters with 20,000 words of dialogue in a constant dance with live technology that blurs the boundary between film and stage.During early preview performances, the show attracted attention for more than its ambition, as some audience members complained online that Erivo appeared to still be learning sections of the script and at moments relied on an autocue. But speaking after the show's opening night on Tuesday, the 39-year-old told the BBC she blocks out those comments. \"I'm not paying attention to any of them as no-one knows the experience except me,\" she said. \"It's not for me.\" \"I have a job to do and I want to do it as well as I can and I want to do it with all my heart. I don't let the comments take the energy that I should be spending on the stage.\" Daniel BoudErivo accepts that she was \"still learning my lines and figuring it out\" during the preview shows, adding that \"bit by bit it's become something that's a part of me, and everyone's learning process is different\". The production is stripped back and minimal. Erivo conjures the Victorian world  through voice and movement and her Dracula, delivered in a Nigerian accent and crowned with bright red hair, is only one of dozens of transformations. She slips between characters through rapid costume changes as several cameras film her live, projecting close-ups of her face onto a screen where the audience watches much of the action unfold.'I choose the challenges'Bram Stoker's 1897 novel about a Transylvanian vampire whose move to England unleashes terror, obsession and desire is one of the most frequently adapted works of fiction in history, with hundreds of stage and screen versions reinventing the vampire for new generations.Erivo said she hopes Stoker would like this adaptation and explained why she chose to take on the role. \"It challenges me and makes me learn in a different way so I am forced to grow as an artist,\" she said.\"If things were easy it would be boring so I choose the challenges.\" A stage performer at heart, Erivo made her West End debut in 2011 and has since become one of the few artists nominated for an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award, winning all but the Oscar.Daniel BoudAsked what it actually takes to prepare for a performance of that scale night after night, Erivo described a routine built on discipline and repetition.\"You have some good people who can help and it takes time and patience,\" she said. \"You find your way in and the through-line, and it becomes easier to learn.\" She added that before every show she meditates, has an extensive vocal warm-up and \"runs sections of the show\". Erivo is not the only Wicked star performing in the West End. Her former co-stars Ariana Grande and Jonathan Bailey are set to reunite for a London revival of Stephen Sondheim's Sunday in the Park with George at the Barbican in 2027.Erivo tells BBC News she would not rule out sharing a stage with them in future. \"Maybe it's something I'd consider,\" she said. \"I'd never say no.\" Middling reviewsDracula has divided critics so far. \"From defying gravity to defying mortality – Cynthia Erivo gives an extraordinary, shape shifting performance,\" wrote the Standard's Nick Curtis in a four-star review.\"Her performance triumphantly walks a knife edge between virtuosity and absurdity.But many critics were far less positive. In a two-star review, Sam Marlowe of the Stage said that the show had \"sounded like such a toothsome prospect\", but that the result is \"bloodless\". \"What could possibly go wrong? Sadly, the answer is: almost everything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't go so far as to say it sucks, but it certainly doesn't bite.\"Getty Images\"The story is narrated by Erivo, with only snippets in dialogue,\" she explained, \"which gives the sense of an audiobook accompanied by screen illustrations.\"\"Over a very long and testing two hours and five minutes – unrelieved by the mercy of an interval – [Erivo] gives an astonishing performance,\" he said.\"I didn't come here to watch a film about Dracula, I came here to watch a live show,\" he said. \"The production disassociates you with much of the feeling and heft of live performance.\"Olivia Garrett of the Radio Times agreed the show is \"let down by overproduction\" in a three-star review, adding: \"Like Dracula himself, this production sits stranded in the middle, not dead, not alive, but somewhere in between.\"\"The British actress proves any doubters wrong,\" he said in his four-star review. \"This isn't a flawless night but it's a tour de force even so.\"Additional reporting by Steven McIntosh.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNathan Briant,South of EnglandandDuncan Kennedy,CorrespondentBBCBarry O'Sullivan was found guilty of causing death by careless driving at Reading Crown Court on Wednesday A van driver who crashed into a broken-down car in a smart motorway's outside lane has been found guilty of causing death by careless driving.Barry O'Sullivan was driving on the M4 in Berkshire when he hit the stationary Nissan Micra, which burst into flames with Pulvinder Dhillon inside it, on 7 March 2022.O'Sullivan, 45, of Wixams, Bedfordshire, said there was nothing to warn him of the car on the motorway, with signs and alerts defective for days before the crash. Prosecutors at Reading Crown Court said any competent driver should still have avoided the Micra, owned by Dhillon's daughter, Rajpal Dene, on the motorway westbound between junctions 11 and 12.But the defence argued that an accident was always likely to happen and that O'Sullivan was failed by the smart motorway system.Family handoutPulvinder Dhillon was \"loved and respected by all she knew\", her family saidO'Sullivan was found to have been driving his Ford Transit Connect van at about 77mph in the moments before the crash at about 08:30 GMT.Footage taken in the moments before the impact showed multiple motorists driving around the marooned car.Prosecutor Ian Hope said O'Sullivan \"essentially ploughed straight into the back of the stationary Nissan, with there being no apparent avoiding action to the naked eye.\"O'Sullivan, who had a clean driving licence and showed no trace of alcohol or drugs, suffered serious injuries himself and was in hospital for four months following the incident.Speaking outside Reading Crown Court following the verdict, O'Sullivan said: \"I would like to say how sorry I am to the family.\"When asked if he could potentially appeal, he added: \"I need to seek legal advice before I make any decisions.\"Alerts from radars to detect stopped vehicles had not been working on the M4 between junctions 8/9 to 12 for five days before the crash, the court heard.Smart motorways use technology to regulate traffic flow and ease congestion.They also use the hard shoulder as an extra lane of traffic to increase capacity, but critics claim that has led to road deaths.Instead of a continuous hard shoulder, there are refuges every mile.The £814m project to install a 32-mile stretch of smart motorway, between junction 3 at Hayes and junction 12 at Theale in Berkshire, was completed in December 2022. In April 2023, the Conservative government cancelled plans for all new smart motorways following safety and cost concerns. A National Highways spokesperson said: \"Any death on our roads is one too many and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Pulvinder Dhillon following this tragic incident.\"While nothing can ever compensate for their loss, the person responsible has been found guilty of driving carelessly.\"O'Sullivan is due to be sentenced on 24 April.

    "body": "3 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesDefence giant BAE Systems has hailed record results for 2025 while staff at its Lancashire sites continue striking over pay.One of Britain's biggest unions, Unite, has called the weapons maker's £2.6bn annual profit \"obscene\" and warned strikes would continue until a better pay offer is made.BAE, Europe's biggest defence contractor, unveiled a sharp rise in sales and record order backlog on Wednesday as governments around the world boost their defence budgets.The weapons maker said it has made a fair offer to staff, who currently receive \"market-leading pay and rewards\", and it is engaging with unions. BAE on Wednesday hailed record results for 2025, which saw sales rise by a tenth to a record £30.7bn. Profit before tax at the defence giant was £2.6bn, up from £2.3bn a year earlier, with shares climbing by 3% after the announcement. Chief executive Charles Woodburn highlighted the firm's record order backlog, as geopolitical uncertainty causes countries around the world to ramp up their defence spending. Unite, which represents 5,000 workers at BAE's factories in Warton and Samlesbury, said its workers \"know their value and want their fair share of the pie\". The union said higher-skilled staff at the sites were last year given 3.6% pay increases \"against their will\", while those on the factory floor agreed to a 4.2% rise and an extra day off.Local Unite organiser Ross Quinn said the striking staff, on average salaries of £50,000, were \"crucial\" to BAE's success. And Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, said: \"BAE's profits are little short of obscene. The company is making billions from government contracts and yet refuses to pay our members what they are worth.\" BAE has offered 3.7% raises for 2026. Those on strike are demanding 5.2% increases to account for last year's below-inflation raises. A BAE Systems spokesperson said the current offer \"is fair and ensures that our employees continued to receive market-leading pay and rewards, while balancing our need to be competitive and affordable for our customers\". On the prospect of strike action continuing into March, BAE said: \"With the majority of our employees working as normal, we are focused on minimising any disruption and implementing our robust contingency plans.\" Speaking after the company's record results, Woodburn, who has run BAE since 2017, said: \"In a new era of defence spending, driven by escalating security challenges, we're well-positioned to provide both the advanced conventional systems and disruptive technologies needed to protect the nations we serve now and into the future.\"The firm is expecting profits to grow further, by around 10% in 2026, it said. Ross Quinn/SuppliedUnite said its targeted strike action removed key people from the production processThe latest walkout began on 2 February, with more than 1,200 Unite members expected to strike until at least 20 February. Richard Hunter, an analyst at Interactive Investor, said of the record year at the defence contractor: \"BAE is basking in the increasing heat of geopolitical tensions with a set of results which have comfortably blown past estimates.\"The UK, like other Nato allies has increased the amount it spends on weapons and defence contracts.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer promised last year to spend 2.5% of national economic output – measured as gross domestic product (GDP) - on core defence by April 2027.The BBC this week reported that could increase further to 3% by the end of this parliament.",

    "body": "2 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongandGuy LambertGetty ImagesThe former prince has come under renewed scrutiny in recent months over his past ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The Metropolitan Police is carrying out \"initial inquiries\" into allegations relating to close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. It comes after an unnamed former senior Met protection officer told LBC that members of the Royalty and Specialist Protection (RaSP) may have \"wilfully turned a blind eye\" during visits to a private island owned by Jeffery Epstein. Multiple survivors have alleged they were trafficked to and abused on the island, known as Little St James, which Epstein purchased in 1998.In a statement, the Met said it had \"not identified any wrongdoing\" but \"initial enquiries into these specific allegations have begun so we can establish the facts\".Speaking to LBC on Tuesday, the former Met protection officer claimed Andrew's protection team travelled with him to the private island on at least two occasions, including travelling on Epstein's private jet on one of those occasions. The unnamed former officer said there were \"real concerns\" in the late 1990s and early 2000s that the \"royal protection team became too close to their principals\", and staff were \"terrified\" of being demoted.Under the rules governing how police forces are held to account, the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) would carry out any further investigation should the initial Met assessment identify concerns. Andrew's accuser Virginia Giuffre alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Little St James in the early 2000s.While Andrew reached a financial settlement with Giuffre, it did not constitute an admission of wrongdoing, and the former prince has always strenuously denied any offence. Epstein was found dead in his prison cell on 10 August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Multiple police forces across the UK have said they are assessing whether to launch investigations into Epstein-related allegations. They are:Thames Valley Police - assessing allegations that a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the former princeEssex Police - examining flight logs and emails referencing Epstein's private jet using Stansted AirportBedfordshire Police - assessing Epstein's use of London Luton AirportMet Police - launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson, following claims he passed market-sensitive information to EpsteinSurrey Police - seeking information on an allegation of human trafficking and sexual assault dating back to the mid-1990sNorfolk Constabulary - reviewing Epstein files but have not received specific allegationsWiltshire Police - reviewing its records and \"cannot definitively say that we have not had any allegations at this stage\", and said it had supported the MetPolice Scotland - said it wanted to \"speak to anyone with information\" about Epstein's private jet using Edinburgh AirportWest Midlands Police - confirmed it was assessing the private flights into and out of Birmingham Airport following the publication of Epstein files The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has set up a national coordination group that is working with the National Crime Agency to support the number of forces carrying out enquiries.A NPCC spokesperson said this will help forces \"understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been made\", adding \"it may take some time due to the volume of material and the complexity of international jurisdictions\". \"The sharing of documents related to oversees criminal investigations between law enforcement agencies in different countries is an extremely complex process, and not straight forward.\"Additional reporting by Chi Chi Izundu Clarification 18 February: The story initially reported the Metropolitan Police is carrying out \"initial inquiries\" into close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. The story has been amended  to make clear the force is carrying out  \"initial inquiries\" into allegations relating to close protection officers formerly assigned to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoJoe Pike,Political correspondentandBrian Wheeler,Political reporterGetty ImagesMinisters are considering slowing down plans to pay adults of all ages the same minimum wage.Labour committed in their election manifesto to remove \"discretionary age bands\" and increase the wages of 18 to 20-year-olds so they are paid the same as those over 21.But government sources have confirmed ministers are interested in delaying that rise, though are unlikely to reverse the commitment entirely.Some business leaders say minimum wage increases are making it too expensive for them to hire young people - but unions say it is unfair that the young can be paid less for doing the same job as older people.The government has already made a start on ending the gap between minimum pay for younger and older workers.The hourly for rate for 18 to 20-year-olds will rise by 85p to £10.85 in April, with under-18s and apprentices getting 45p more to £8 an hour. That comes on top of 16.3% rise for 18 to 20-year-olds in 2024.The minimum wage for those aged 21 and over has been rising at a slower rate and is due to go up by 50p to £12.71 an hour in April.That leaves a gap of £1.86 an hour between younger and older workers, which the government has committed to closing before the next election in 2029.The Times newspaper first reported that ministers were weighing up whether to drop the pledge.Chancellor Rachel Reeves did not deny that the process could now be delayed when asked about it on a visit to a supermarket in south London.She said: \"We already have incentives to hire young people with the apprenticeship rate of the minimum wage, but also for no national insurance contributions for the youngest workers.\"But we do recognise there are challenges and that is why we're extending the number of further education college places, extending the number of apprenticeship places to help young people get the skills and the experience that they need to move into work.\"At an event in south Wales, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"We've made commitments to young people in our manifesto, and we will keep to those commitments, including the commitment that we would make sure that the living wage would go up this April, which I can absolutely confirm to you will happen.\"On Tuesday, it was confirmed unemployment had risen to a near five-year high, with the jobless rate among young people at its worst level for more than a decade.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate of unemployment rose to 5.2% in the three months to December, up from 5.1% in the three months to November.Luke Johnson, the former chairman of Pizza Express and a director of Gail's bakery and Brompton Bicycles, said: \"The government is making it more expensive and more risky to employ people and so I think entrepreneurs and managers will not create the jobs.\"He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The mood amongst employers and those who invest in this country is the darkest I have ever seen.\"He argued that it was fair to pay a lower rate to young workers because \"if someone is less experienced and less well trained than someone who has been doing the job for a while they are not necessarily going to be as productive\".Johnson said the timing of the planned increases in the minimum wage was a \"tragedy\" for young people because there was set to be a \"substantial rise in unemployment\" in the coming years due to Artificial Intelligence and other factors.Tina McKenzie, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \"Sharply rising employment costs, alongside other increasing costs of doing business, are already chilling hiring intentions. \"Even steeper increases after the coming April hike would have priced many more young people out of jobs.\"But Unison, which represents NHS and other public service workers, said competitive wages were needed to \"keep and attract the staff\".The union's head of policy, Sampson Low, said: \"There's no reason for younger workers to be paid less for the same work.\"Young, low-paid workers are likely to spend the extra cash where they live, helping their local economies.\"Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB Union, which represents workers across public utilities, said: \"Employers tell us that every single improvement in workers' rights is going to cause a problem and time and time again they have been proved wrong.\"",

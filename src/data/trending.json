Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.PA MediaAndrew served in the Royal Navy for 22 yearsSpeaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, royal author and journalist Valentine Low said this latest move, to lose his final military title, will be a \"blow\" to Andrew.\"Royals, and particularly Andrew, are very proud and determined to hang onto military titles,\" he said.\"It seems the King is intent on taking absolutely everything away from his brother. It's a flinty eyed ruthlessness he's displaying.\"Everything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proud\"Read the King's statement in fullWatch: Question Time audience reacts to newsIs this finally rock bottom for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandalWhere does the King get his money?The prince had already returned his other military titles and royal patronages in 2022, and stopped using the title His Royal Highness in an official capacity, after he was accused of sexual abuse in a civil case in the US.He later settled the case brought against him by Virginia Giuffre, a victim of sex trafficking and abuse by Jeffrey Epstein, who alleged the prince sexually abused her when she was a teenager - something the prince has consistently denied.Military titles that Andrew lost at the time included colonel of the Grenadier Guards - one of the most senior infantry regiments in the British army.He also lost several overseas honorary roles, including colonel-in-chief of The Royal Highland Fusiliers Of Canada, and colonel-in-chief of the Royal New Zealand Army Logistic Regiment.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,in KingstonEPA/ShutterstockBlack River was one of the worst hit areas by Hurricane Melissa with residents previously telling the BBC they have lived in a state of chaos since the stormA flight chartered by the UK government to evacuate British nationals from Jamaica in the wake of Hurricane Melissa is due to land at London's Gatwick Airport.The flight, which left Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport on Saturday, comes after the UK flew in aid as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package.Some of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those to have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, blocked roads have complicated distribution after Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 28 people.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days, leaving behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 31 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK Foreign Office has asked citizens there to register their presence and advised travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options were available.The UK initially set aside a £2.5m immediate financial support package for the region, with an additional £5m announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday as \"more information... on the scale of the devastation\" emerged.The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.The Red Cross said that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others to drive to an area where they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.AFP via Getty ImagesParts of St Elizabeth have experienced flooding in recent daysThe country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals on Saturday - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said. \"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services.\"Dr Tufton added: \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet.\"The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a daily supply of water.Landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable - complicating the distribution of aid across the island.However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief by Sunday.At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out from Kingston on Saturday with a seven-truck convoy heading to Black River, the badly damaged town in western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon.Melissa - the strongest hurricane so far this year - made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday, with sustained winds of up to 185mph (295km/h).A category five storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale is the strongest kind, with wind speeds in excess of 157mph, making hurricanes of this strength capable of catastrophic destruction.",

    "body": "Trump tells military to prepare for 'action' against Islamist militants in NigeriaUS President Donald Trump has ordered the preparation of plans for military action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups, accusing the government of not doing enough to halt the killing of Christians.Trump did not say which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent weeks and months in some right-wing US circles.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.The government of Africa's most populous nation has not responded to the threat of US military action.However, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu insisted that there was religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday that he had instructed the US Department of War to prepare for \"possible action\".He warned that he might send the military into Nigeria \"guns-a-blazing\" unless the Nigerian government intervened, and said that all aid to what he called \"the now disgraced country\" would be cut.Trump added: \"If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!\"Secretary of State for War Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing: \"Yes sir.\"The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.\"Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"Country of Particular Concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US State Department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect communities of all faiths.\"The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality,\" the Nigerian leader said in a statement.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture. Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed, but atrocities have been committed on both sides and human rights group say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Trump has frequently expressed satisfaction over not having embroiled the US in a war during his tenure, and has cast himself as a peace-making president.But the Republican leader is facing a growing number of voices domestically, particularly from the political right, who have drawn attention to the situation in Nigeria.Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor in Abuja",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, AFP via Getty ImagesImage caption, Fireworks night in Sefton Park, Liverpool, in 2009 featuring an almost full MoonBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter The second of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 will coincide with Bonfire Night on Wednesday.The full Beaver Moon rises in the UK at around 15:55 GMT on 5 November.It will be the largest and brightest Moon this year.If you want to catch a glimpse, keep an eye on the forecast to see where has the best chance of seeing clear skies.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.November's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingThe week ahead is looking changeable, with a series of low pressure systems expected to move west to east across the UK. This means spells of rain and wind at times interspersed with calmer and drier interludes.It is too soon to say exactly where will have optimum viewing conditions for the Beaver Moon on Wednesday but the current most likely weather pattern is for a frontal system to bring cloud and rain to the south, with increasing chances of clearer skies and drier conditions further north.Keep up to date with the forecast as we approach Bonfire Night by checking the BBC Weather website or App.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "4 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness CorrespondentJas BainsJas Bains alerted Danish authorities to a £1bn tax scam and they hit him with a lawsuit\"We'd be met at airports in 20-foot limousines, and taken to places like the Atlantis hotel in Dubai or the Singapore Grand Prix. There'd be a hundred grand spent in the bar.\"In 2013, Jas Bains was an ambitious young lawyer, enjoying the high life that came with working for an extremely profitable City hedge fund.Today, he is jobless and has lost most of his wealth, having spent years fighting legal battles and attempting to clear his name of association with a huge tax scam.The irony, he says, is that he blew the whistle on the scam in the first place – only to find himself one of the targets of a £1.4bn lawsuit.He is reflecting one month after the case ended, bringing to a close eight years of legal arguments and one of the highest value civil cases ever heard in the UK.The Danish tax authority was left licking its wounds, after failing to establish that a large group of defendants, including Mr Bains, were liable for huge losses it had suffered.It all began in 2009, when a banker named Sanjay Shah established a London-based hedge fund called Solo Capital. It also had offices in Dubai. It was one of a network of funds, banks and legal outfits that were to become heavily implicated in the so-called cum-ex trade.This focused on transactions where shares were sold from one investor to another immediately before the payment of a dividend (cum, or with, dividend) but delivered afterwards (ex-dividend).Those involved exploited delays in processing the sale to create confusion over who actually owned the shares at the moment when the dividend was paid. This tactic allowed both parties to claim rebates on withholding tax - a levy which had only been paid once, when the dividend was issued.From the outside, it was complicated, but for those involved it led to ever bigger and more elaborate trades which ultimately cost taxpayers across Europe billions.It initially became popular in Germany, before spreading to other countries including France, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Solo Capital targeted Denmark, with the bulk of its cum-ex trades taking place from 2013 onwards.Jas Bains joined the company in 2010, as its head lawyer, but went on to run the London office. At the time, Solo was \"a successful firm, making money in five or six different areas pretty well\".Getty ImagesSanjay Shah was imprisoned in Denmark in a separate criminal trial last year And making money meant enjoying the high life, with staff going on sprees to places like Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"What I will say about Sanjay is he knew how to throw a party,\" he says.\"One time we were in the Ku De Ta club at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in Singapore. He bought 20 bottles of vintage Dom Perignon champagne, and people were just spraying each other with the stuff.\"People have likened it to Wolf of Wall Street and such like.\"It didn't end there. \"Sanjay organised private concerts in Dubai with Prince. A small room with him and his friends at three or four million dollars for an evening ... private concerts with Snoop Dogg.\"By mid-2014, however, Mr Bains had fallen out with his boss and left the company for a competitor. At the time, the cum-ex transactions targeting Denmark were dramatically picking up.\"I was hearing from people who'd left Solo that Sanjay was doing some big trades in 2014, but look, I'd moved on, it didn't have much to do with me,\" he says.\"But then I heard, actually Sanjay made close to €100m in trades from Denmark in 2013, closer to €250m in 2014 and he was looking for a billion in 2015.\"Alarm bells were ringing.Jas BainsAt the height of his career Jas Bains enjoyed living the high life in Las Vegas, Singapore and Dubai.\"I thought this can't be right. It's not that I thought the trades were invalid or criminal in some way. It's just any country that has a billion Euros syphoned off it will scream bloody murder.\"Solo Capital wasn't the only company now targeting Denmark. Others were getting in on the act. Jas believed it was only a matter of time before the house of cards came tumbling down.\"I was quite confident I'd done nothing wrong, but I knew if this carried on and blew up in spectacular style, I was going to get pulled in,\" he explains.With that in mind, in 2015, he decided to blow the whistle.He contacted a Danish lawyer, who in turn put him in touch with the Danish police. He went on to spend two and a half years assisting them with understanding how the cum-ex scam worked.Danish prosecutors did not target Mr Bains. Their attention was focused firmly on Mr Shah. The 54-year-old was eventually extradited from Dubai to face fraud charges – and in December last year was sentenced to 12 years in jail.It was the heaviest penalty ever handed out in Denmark for a fraud case. He is currently appealing.'Impossible to get a job'But when the Danish tax authority, Skatteforvaltningen (Skat), launched its huge case, seeking to recover its lost money, Mr Bains was one of the more than 100 individual and corporate defendants initially targeted - alongside Mr Shah.With that lawsuit hanging over him it became out of the question for him to work as a lawyer, or to get a role in the City of London. \"It's impossible to get a job if you're being sued as part of a two billion dollar international tax fraud case,\" he says.However, in October, High court judge Mr Justice Andrew Baker threw out Skat's claims.Acknowledging that \"greed can be a powerful motive, and I consider there was substantial greed here\", he nevertheless concluded that Skat has failed to prove it was a victim of deception.The authority's \"controls for assessing and paying dividend tax refund claims were so flimsy as to be non-existent,\" he said.That seemed to echo a statement previously made by Mr Shah in a 2021 German TV interview, which was also cited in the ruling:\"Why would they pay out for years and years and then, after four years of payments they say, 'Oh, we made a mistake, or we were cheated'\", he said.\"If there's a big sign on the street saying 'please help yourself', then me or somebody else would go and help themselves.\"There may still be an appeal. But for Mr Bains, the ruling provided some much-needed closure – and, he says, a chance to move on.",

    "body": "The musician with 14 aliases and millions of listeners  7 days agoAuryn CoxBBC News NIOlivia OsbyLiam McCay is possibly best known as Sign Crushes Motorist, although he has released music under a variety of namesLiam McCay was driving down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles with a friend from Ireland when it set in just how different his life had become.\"We could see the Hollywood sign, and we were like, 'this is mental',\" the 20-year-old from County Donegal told BBC News NI.Just two years ago he was working part-time at a restaurant in his hometown of Buncrana, creating music in his spare time.Now his songs, which he releases under a variety of aliases, have garnered millions of monthly listeners on streaming platforms.It all started in his childhood bedroom, where he began creating songs under the name Moon Water while still a teenager at school. \"My plan was I would just keep the one name and then I got kind of bored and I started making this other wee thing,\" he said.\"And I was like, God, this doesn't really fit the sort of the vibe of the other one. So I says, I'll not put it under that, I'll do it under a new name.\"Liam McCayLiam began making music from his bedroom in Buncrana That process continued and he now has 14 aliases under which he releases music. He is possibly best known as Sign Crushes Motorist and for making slowcore tracks. Slowcore is a subgenre of indie rock characterised by its slow tempos, minimal arrangements, and melancholic atmosphere.Sign Crushes Motorist currently has about 2.2m monthly listeners on Spotify, while another of his projects, Take Care has about 2.4m.He said the majority of his projects may sound similar to people who do not listen to that style of music, but added that he also explores different genres.\"To me, they're all kind of different, they all have their own different vibes and stuff,\" he said.\"But I have everything. I love making different types of music, I have acoustic stuff, the slowcore stuff - I rap the odd time. It's nice to make whatever.\"Olivia OsbyLiam shared his music on servers and forums for new musiciansHe started releasing music in 2021 when he was 16, but largely kept his creative endeavours a secret, choosing to put his songs online rather than sharing it with people in his personal life.He spent time on servers and forums for new musicians sharing their work and looking for feedback.\"I was doing the most nerdy stuff to try and get it out there. Just hoping someone would hear it,\" he said.\"It was a bit embarrassing because it wasn't cool music, and I was also like whingeing about this girl or whatever. So, I wasn't really wanting to show people.\"Gradually people started listening. By 2023 several of his tracks had taken off, with one peaking at number three on Billboard's now defunct TikTok top 50 chart which ranked the most popular songs on the platform.'This is good craic'Olivia OsbyIt was a trip to the US to collaborate with other artists which convinced Liam to make music full time Despite Liam's success and growing number of fans, he was happy to keep his music as a hobby, even as the money started to trickle in.\"I didn't go mental or anything and buy like a sports car,\" he said.\"I was making a decent amount of money. I could have lived off of it, but I said no it'll sort of lose the magic. It'll just be a nice hobby to do in the evenings.\"When Liam finished his school exams he went to university in Belfast to study computer science.While he said he enjoyed the university experience and was doing well on his course, he realised he did not enjoy it as much as making music.After a couple of trips to the US which saw him collaborate with other artists, he decided to make a career out of his music.\"So after that, I was like, 'this is good craic' I really want to do this as much as I can,\" he said.Eva SmittleLiam recently released an album under the name Dead CalmLiam dropped out of further education after his first year and has since moved to Los Angeles in California where he has been performing live gigs.He recently released an album under the name Dead Calm.\"That's kind of acoustic, that'll be the one I'll be doing all the gigs for. Because it's just like the most kind of upbeat. That's a lot of fun to do,\" he said.Liam said he wants to do \"everything\" and would like to one day try his hand at acting or filmmaking - but for now will continue to make new music.He said he has had plenty of offers from labels but is happy enough as an independent artist.Examples of other names he goes by are Miserable Teens Club, scm48 and Carson Clay.He said people in the industry have advised him against using so many aliases. They say he could become more popular if he put all his music under one name.\"I'll never put them all under one, but I'll definitely slow down in making new ones,\" he said.Liam added that for fans, it can be fun trying to track down all his music. \"It's not like I hide them but it sometimes takes people a while to find them,\" he said.\"The idea of having to go and search them out, it definitely adds a wee something.\"",

    "body": "Young Russians are being seduced by a cheap, dangerous weight-loss pill called Molecule12 hours agoSofya VolyanovaBBC News Russian Maria22-year-old Maria suffered serious side effects after trying the unlicensed weight loss drug promoted on TikTokMolecule, a pill promising rapid weight loss, went viral on Russian TikTok earlier this year.Young people's feeds started filling up with captions like \"Take Molecule and forget food exists\", and \"Do you want to sit in the back of the class in oversized clothes?\"Clips showed fridges lined with blue boxes featuring holograms and \"Molecule Plus\" labels.The orders began piling in, as teenagers shared their \"weight-loss journeys\" on social media.But there was a catch.Maria, 22, had purchased the pill from a popular online retailer. She took two pills per day and, after two weeks, says her mouth dried up and she completely lost her appetite.\"I had absolutely no desire to eat, let alone drink. I was nervous. I was constantly biting my lips and chewing my cheeks.\"Maria developed severe anxiety and began having negative thoughts. \"These pills were having a profound effect on my psyche,\" she says.Maria, who lives in St Petersburg, says she wasn't prepared for such severe side effects.Other TikTok users mentioned dilated pupils, tremors and insomnia. And at least three schoolchildren are reported to have ended up in hospital.TikTokClips shared on TikTok show fridges lined with soft drinks and blue boxes of MoleculeIn April, a schoolgirl in Chita, Siberia, needed hospital care after overdosing on Molecule. According to local reports, she was trying to lose weight quickly, in time for the summer.The mother of another schoolgirl told local media her daughter was admitted to intensive care after taking several pills at once.And in May, a 13-year-old boy from St Petersburg needed hospital care after experiencing hallucinations and panic attacks. He had reportedly asked a friend to buy him the pill because he was being teased at school about his weight.Substance banned in UK, EU and USThe packaging for Molecule pills often lists \"natural ingredients\" such as dandelion root and fennel seed extract.But earlier this year, journalists at the Russian newspaper Izvestiya submitted pills they had purchased online for testing and found they contained a substance called sibutramine.TikTokThe pills contain a substance called sibutramine, which is banned in many countriesFirst used as an antidepressant in the 1980s and later as an appetite suppressant, studies later found sibutramine increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes - while only slightly promoting weight loss.It was banned in the US in 2010, and is also illegal in the UK, EU, China and other countries.In Russia, it is still used to treat obesity, but available only to adults and by prescription. Purchasing and selling sibutramine without a prescription is a criminal offence. But that hasn't stopped individuals and small businesses from selling it online - often in higher doses than legal medication - and without requiring prescriptions.The unlicensed pills cost about £6-7 ($8-9) for a 20-day supply - much cheaper than recognised weight-loss injections like Ozempic, which on the Russian market sell for £40-160 ($50-210) per monthly pen.\"Self-administration of this drug is very unsafe,\" says endocrinologist Ksenia Solovieva from St Petersburg, warning of potential overdose risks, \"because we do not know how much of the active ingredient such 'dietary supplements' may contain\".TikTokTeenagers and young people order unlicensed weight loss pills sold as dietary supplements from popular marketplacesRussians regularly receive prison sentences for purchasing and reselling Molecule pills. But it's proving difficult for authorities to get a grip on the drug being sold illegally.In April, the government-backed Safe Internet League reported the growing trend involving young people to the authorities - prompting several major online marketplaces to remove Molecule from sale. But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling \"unregistered dietary supplements\" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as \"sports nutrition\" instead.On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine. But it admitted it was difficult to find and remove listings that didn't explicitly mention sibutramine.If you do manage to get your hands on Molecule, it's hard to know exactly what you're getting - and it's unclear where the pills are being manufactured.The BBC found some sellers with production certificates from factories in Guangzhou and Henan, in China. Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.Details of support with eating disorders in the UK are available at BBC Action Line Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders. For those in or near relapse, an easily available appetite suppressant can be seriously dangerous, she says.Anna Enina, a Russian influencer with millions of followers who herself has admitted using unlicensed weight-loss pills in the past, publicly warned her subscribers: \"As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder... the consequences will be dire. You'll regret it tenfold.\"Maria from St Petersburg now discourages others from trying MoleculeTwenty-two-year old Maria suffered bad side effects, and is one of those who regrets it. After taking too many Molecule pills, she was sent to hospital.Now she discourages other young women and girls from taking the pills in weight-loss forums. She even reached out to one teenage user's parents to alert them.But Molecule remains popular online.And every video that appears on Maria's TikTok feed is a reminder of the pills that made her sick.More weekend picks",

    "body": "What we know about stabbings on Doncaster to London train20 minutes agoMaia Davies & Harry Sekulich\"Run, there's a guy stabbing everyone\": Eyewitnesses describe attackWhere did the stabbings happen?The attack took place on the 18:25 GMT London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service from Doncaster, South Yorkshire to London's King Cross station.Passengers said at least one person brandishing a knife began stabbing people on the train after it passed through Peterborough in Cambridgeshire.Police received calls from passengers on board at around 19:40, alerting them to the attack.The train made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon - which is some 15 minutes from Peterborough by train.Altogether, the incident was estimated to last roughly 10 to 15 minutes - and passengers said it took place towards the rear of the train.Armed police boarded the train and arrested two men within eight minutes of the first 999 call. A large emergency service response was also sent to the scene, including air ambulances.Uninjured passengers were interviewed by police and some boarded a coach bound for London.Huntingdon MP Ben Obese-Jecty told the BBC there were about 10 ambulances, several fire engines and \"well over 20 police cars\" when he first arrived at the scene just after 21:00.The station remained shut on Sunday morning, as well as the A1307 directly outside.The empty train was still at the platform, while a police presence and forensics tents could also be seen.What do we know about the suspects?Supt John Loveless of the British Transport Police said two UK nationals were arrested.The men, aged 32 and 35, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.Police said the 32-year-old man is a black British national and the 35-year-old is a British national of Caribbean descent.They have not yet been named and are being held in separate police stations for questioning.What do we know about the victims?PA MediaEmergency crews and police rushed to Huntingdon station in Cambridgeshire after 999 calls from the London-bound trainEmergency crews took 10 people to Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge - which is some 30 minutes away from the train station - and one person later went to the hospital for treatment.Shortly before 11:00 on Sunday, police said two people remained in a life-threatening condition and four had been discharged.No victims have yet been named.What have eyewitnesses said?Witnesses told the BBC of panic and confusion as passengers ran through the carriages, some wounded and bloodied.Olly Foster said he heard people shouting \"run, there's a guy stabbing literally everyone and everything\" - and thought at first it might have been a Halloween prank.He saw an older man with gashes on his head and neck after he \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl. Passengers then used their jackets to try to staunch the bleeding.Watch: Police rush to scene of Cambridgeshire train attackAnother witness, Wren Chambers, said one person had been stabbed in the arm and bolted down the train to alert others - while another shouted \"someone's got a knife\".Some passengers hid inside the toilets while others swarmed towards the front of the train.London Underground worker Dean McFarlane said he saw multiple people running down the platform at Huntingdon bleeding, with one man in a white shirt \"completely covered in blood\".What have police said?British Transport Police (BTP) declared a major incident and initially said counter-terrorism officers were supporting the investigation \"to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident\".The force said it had at one point declared \"Plato\" - the national code word used by emergency services when responding to a \"marauding terror attack\" - but later rescinded it.Supt Loveless later said at a press conference on Sunday morning that \"there is nothing to suggest this is a terrorist incident\".Defence Secretary John Healey told the BBC early reports suggested it was an isolated incident.He added that this was a service he used often - and that he had travelled along the same route just hours before the attack - and paid tribute to the emergency response.What has the reaction been?ReutersPolice remained at the station on Sunday morning, where the empty train sat near the platformPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the \"appalling incident on a train near Huntingdon is deeply concerning\".He wrote on X: \"My thoughts are with all those affected, and my thanks go to the emergency services for their response.\"Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said said her thoughts were with the victims, their friends and family and praised emergency workers who \"responded rapidly, with the utmost professionalism and saving lives\".King Charles issued a statement saying he and Queen Camilla extended their \"deepest sympathy\" to those affected and their loved ones.\"My wife and I were truly appalled and shocked to hear of the dreadful knife attack that took place on board a train in Cambridgeshire last night.\"\"We are particularly grateful to the emergency services for their response to this awful incident.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC she was \"horrified\" by the attack: \"I can only imagine how frightening it must have been to be in an enclosed environment with someone rampaging in that fashion.\"She praised the emergency response to the incident and urged people not to speculate, while questioning why \"we're seeing more and more violence on our streets\" despite efforts to tackle knife crime.What is happening with train services? LNER urged passengers to check before travelling on Sunday due to possible cancellations or changes to services.Tickets for Saturday and Sunday will be valid until Friday, and those who no longer want to travel this week can get a refund.Lines have reopened between Hitchin and Peterborough. Great Northern and Thameslink trains between London Kings Cross and Peterborough will run, but there may be delays or cancellations.A rail replacement service is in place to and from Huntingdon, which will remain closed until the end of Sunday.Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said passengers would see a \"high visibility presence\" of police at stations and on trains throughout the day \"to reassure the public\", and that she was receiving regular updates from the police and LNER.",

    "body": "Dark energy just got even weirder and why the Universe may end in a 'Big Crunch'12 hours agoPallab GhoshKPNO/NOIRLabA lonely telescope in the Arizona desert tracks millions of distant galaxies to determine the ultimate fate of the UniverseThere is growing controversy over recent evidence suggesting that a mysterious force known as dark energy might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space.An analysis by a South Korean team has hinted that, rather than the Universe continuing to expand, galaxies could be pulled back together by gravity, ending in what astronomers call a \"Big Crunch\".The scientists involved believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation.Other astronomers have questioned these findings, but these critics have not been able to completely dismiss the South Korean team's assertions.NASA/ESAThese are thousands of galaxies captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. dark energy is driving them apart at ever increasing speedWhat is dark energy?Astronomers previously thought the Universe's expansion, which began with the Big Bang about 13.8 billion years ago, should gradually slow due to gravity.Then evidence for dark energy was discovered in 1998 as a force accelerating the expansion of the Universe. Studies of very bright exploding stars called supernovas showed that rather than slowing down, distant galaxies were actually accelerating away from each other.Some theories suggested that this ever‑accelerating Universe could first spread the stars so far apart that almost nothing would be visible in the night sky and, more shockingly, might eventually tear even atoms themselves apart in a \"Big Rip\".The controversy began in March with unexpected results from an instrument on a telescope in the Arizona desert called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (Desi).Desi was built to discover more about dark energy. It tracked the acceleration of millions of galaxies in exquisite detail, but astronomers were not expecting the results it came up with.The data hinted that acceleration of the galaxies had changed over time, something not in line with the standard picture, according to Prof Ofer Lahav of University College London, who is involved with the Desi project.\"Now with this changing dark energy going up and then down, again, we need a new mechanism. And this could be a shake up for the whole of physics,\" he says.Then in November the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) published research from a South Korean team that seems to back the view that the weirdness of dark energy is weirder still.Prof Young Wook Lee of Yonsei University in Seoul and his team went back to the kind of supernova data that first revealed dark energy 27 years ago. Instead of treating these stellar explosions as having one standard brightness, they adjusted for the ages of the galaxies they came from and worked out how bright the supernovas really were.This adjustment showed that not only had dark energy changed over time, but, shockingly, that the acceleration was slowing down.\"The fate of the Universe will change,\" Prof Lee tells BBC News starkly.\"If dark energy is not constant and it's getting weakened, this will change the whole paradigm of modern cosmology.\"If, as Prof Lee's results suggest, the force that is pushing galaxies away from each other - dark energy - is weakening, then one possibility is that it becomes so weak that gravity begins to pull the galaxies back together.\"Rather than ending with a Big Rip, a Big Crunch is now a possibility.\"Which outcome wins, depends on the true nature of dark energy, for which we still do not know the answer,\" says Prof Lee.Prof Lee's work has been checked by fellow experts and published in a respected journal of the RAS. But his claims have not gone down at all well with many senior astronomers working in the field, such as Prof George Efstathiou of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.\"I think that this is just reflecting the messy details of supernovas,\" he says. \"The correlation with age is not very tight, so I think it is dangerous to apply a 'correction'. It looks weak to me.\"The mainstream view is that the Universe is still accelerating with almost unchanging dark energy.But Prof Lee pushes back strongly on such criticisms.\"Our data is based on 300 galaxies. The statistical significance is roughly one-in-a-trillion chance of being a fluke. So, I strongly feel that already our research is very, very significant.\"Marilyn Sargent/Berkeley LabA cathedral for the cosmos: an instrument inside this telescope can track the movement of 5,000 galaxies at a timeSince the South Korean results, two teams have reassessed the brightness of some of the supernovas. They looked at an earlier study that fed into the Desi results from March which began the whole hoo-hah. They did so to double-check the March results because the claim that dark energy was changing was so controversial.Both teams have pulled back slightly from the original hints, but the hints have not gone away, even after extensive scrutiny.Consequently there will continue to be passionate, sometimes contentious, debate over whether the cosmos is gently whispering to us about its true nature, or whether astronomers are chasing celestial ghosts.Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on the subject and astronomers are split on what they think is the best explanation. This is no bad thing, according to Prof Robert Massey, who is RAS's Deputy Director.\"Who doesn't want to understand how the universe is going to end and how it began?\" he says. \"Human beings have always been interested in that, whether you take it from a religious perspective or a scientific one.\"Being able to think, okay, this is how things will end in many, many billions of years, wouldn't that be extraordinary?\"",

Roads and rail services have also been disrupted due to the storm conditions.In Norway's Nordland region, one of the most northerly counties in the country, the fire department responded to more than 200 weather‑related incidents, broadcaster NRK reported.Storm Johannes cut power to around 23,000 homes in Nordland and a further 9,000 were without electricity in the Inland region, NRK said.In Finland, the storm, known there as Hannes, subsided on Sunday morning but had left more than 33,000 homes without power, according to public broadcaster Yle.Flights at Kittila airport in northern Finland were grounded after heavy winds pushed a passenger jet and a smaller plane off the runway and into a bank of snow, the Helsinki Times reported.The Swiss Air jet, carrying about 150 passengers, had just landed from Geneva and was taxiing when it veered off, the paper said. The smaller jet, a 400XT model, was on the ground at the same time and was also pushed off course by the wind, it added.There have been no reported injuries.The Swedish Transport Administration announced that many train services have been suspended until noon on Sunday.",

    "body": "The head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.In his letter, Richard Grenell, said the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. Grenell, the Trump Kennedy Center president, wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show \"is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name on the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

    "body": "14 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanThe UK is to impose visa restrictions against people arriving from the Democratic Republic of Congo after its government failed to agree to measures allowing the return of illegal migrants and foreign national offenders. Ministers say the DRC has not made changes required under the toughening up of the UK's asylum rules announced in November.Fast-track visa processes will no longer apply to people from the country, while the Home Office said VIPs and politicians would no longer get preferential treatment when coming to the UK.Meanwhile, the Home Office said Angola and Namibia had agreed to step up efforts to take back their citizens, having been threatened with sanctions alongside the DRC.A government source said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood would not hesitate to ban visas for other countries refusing to take citizens back.The Home Office said Angola and Namibia agreeing to improve their processes marked the \"first delivery success from last month's asylum reforms\".The government had warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo if their governments did not rapidly improve co-operation on removals.A Home Office source said the agreements could see thousands of people removed and deported.Under the government's changes to the UK's asylum system, refugee status will become temporary, guaranteed housing support for asylum seekers will end and new capped \"safe and legal routes\" into the UK will be created.Announcing the changes last month, Mahmood had warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with the returns policies, including an \"emergency brake\" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto.It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their \"unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes\".It said there had been some engagement by the DRC but \"unless co-operation rapidly improves\" further measures could be imposed, including the possibility of a complete visa ban on people from the country coming to the UK.Home Secretary Mahmood said: \"We expect countries to play by the rules. If one of their citizens has no right to be here, they must take them back.\"I thank Angola and Namibia and welcome their co-operation. Now is the time for the Democratic Republic of Congo to do the right thing. Take your citizens back or lose the privilege of entering our country.\"",

    "description": "The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury has been urged to scrap plans to spend £100m over the Church of England's historical links to slavery.  In a let",
    "body": "The incoming Archbishop of Canterbury has been urged to scrap plans to spend £100m over the Church of England's historical links to slavery.  In a letter seen by the Sunday Times, a group of Conservative MPs and peers has urged Dame Sarah Mullally to stop the Church from spending the money. They claim the funds can only legally be spent on churches and the payment of clergy wages. In a statement, the Church Commissioners said that arrangements for the fund were being \"developed transparently - in line with charity law\". Mullally, who currently serves as the Bishop of London, will take up her new role as the first-ever female Archbishop of Canterbury next month. The Church of England's slavery links proposal was announced in January 2023 following the publication of a report into the Church's historical links to transatlantic slavery.The report, requested by the Church's financing arm - the Church Commissioners -  found that a fund established by Queen Anne in 1704 to help poor Anglican clergy was used to finance \"great evil\".According to the report, the fund, known as Queen Anne's Bounty, invested in African chattel enslavement and took donations derived from it.After the report's publication, the then-Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the links and said action would be taken to address the Church's \"shameful past\".The Church Commissioners announced a new £100m fund, committed over a nine-year period, to be spent on \"a programme of investment, research and engagement\" in communities damaged by the enslavement of African people during the transatlantic slave trade. However, in their letter to Mullally, MPs and peers have urged the Church to focus on \"strengthening parishes\" rather than on pursuing what they describe as \"high-profile and legally dubious vanity projects\".The letter, whose co-authors include MPs Katie Lam, Chris Philp and Claire Coutinho, adds: \"By law, the endowment must be used to support parish ministry, maintain church buildings, and care for the Church's historic records.\"At a moment when churches across the country are struggling to keep their doors open — many even falling into disrepair — it's wrong to try and justify diverting £100 million to a project entirely separate from those core obligations.\"A spokesperson for the Church Commissioners said: \"The Church Commissioners, as a 320-year-old Christian in-perpetuity endowment fund, has committed £100 million to set up a new investment fund to support healing, justice and repair, in response to the discovery of its historic links with transatlantic African chattel enslavement.\"This is consistent with the Church of England's Fourth Mark of Mission: to 'seek to transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation'. \"Governance arrangements are being developed transparently — in line with charity law, our fiduciary duties, and our moral purpose — to ensure proper oversight and accountability.\"Mullally will formally replace Welby in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in January before being enthroned at Canterbury Cathedral in March.A former NHS chief nurse, the 63-year-old became a priest in 2006 and was appointed as the first female Bishop of London in 2018 - the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.The Church has been without someone in the top job for almost a year after Justin Welby resigned over a safeguarding scandal.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick Eardley,Political correspondentandAlex KleidermanSir Keir Starmer has been criticised for welcoming the arrival of Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah to the UK - after historical social media messages emerged showing the campaigner apparently calling for Zionists to be killed.The dual British national left Egypt this week after being freed from prison. He was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" after sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country.The prime minister said he was \"delighted\" to hear the activist had landed in the UK to be reunited with family.But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said Sir Keir's remarks were a \"serious error of judgement\".Jenrick highlighted Abdel Fattah's messages that endorsed the killing of Zionists and police, and added the prime minister's message amounted to a \"personal, public endorsement\" of the activist.\"Nobody should be imprisoned arbitrarily, nor for peaceful dissent. But neither should the prime minister place the authority of his office behind someone whose own words cross into the language of racism and bloodshed,\" he said in a letter.Cabinet ministers, including Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper and Justice Secretary David Lammy, also published similar posts of support after Abdel Fattah's return.The Jewish Leadership Council, a charity representing Jewish organisations across the UK, criticised what it described as an \"effusive welcome\" from the UK government.The BBC understands the activist's messages had not been brought to attention of the prime minister until they were highlighted in recent days - and the government considers them to be abhorrent. Abdel Fattah's release in September followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actresses Dame Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.He had spent more than a decade of his life behind bars, including being handed a five-year sentence in December 2021 following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.The previous Conservative administration had also lobbied for the activist to be freed and a government spokesman said: \"He is a British citizen. It has been a long-standing priority under successive governments to work for his release from detention, and to see him reunited with his family in the UK.\"A Labour source also accused Jenrick of trying to rewrite history for his own political advantage.A writer, intellectual and software developer, Abdel Fattah rose to prominence during an uprising in 2011 that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.In 2014, Abdel Fattah was nominated for a European human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, but this was withdrawn over tweets about Israel he had posted in 2012.He said his comments had been part of a \"private conversation\" that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza and had been been taken out of context.After being removed from a travel ban list imposed by Egyptian authorities that kept him in the country for three months after his release from jail, Abdel Fattah has now reunited with his 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo in October after his release, he had said:  \"I'm learning how to get back into life.\"He added: \"I'm doing much better than I would have expected. Much better than most people would have expected.\"",

    "body": "Chelsea are investigating after a bottle was thrown towards the Aston Villa bench following their 2-1 Premier League defeat at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.After the full-time whistle, an open plastic bottle was directed at Villa's celebrating bench, splashing staff and players with a liquid that appeared to be water.One member of staff pointed towards the area from which the bottle came, which seemed to be a section containing both Chelsea fans and staff.It remains unclear who was responsible. Chelsea have launched an investigation but have not commented officially at this stage.It is also unclear whether referee Stuart Attwell and his officials saw the incident or whether it will be included in his report. BBC Sport has contacted the Football Association for comment. Villa substitute Ollie Watkins scored twice to overturn Joao Pedro's first-half opener for Chelsea. Unai Emery's side have now equalled a club record of 11 consecutive wins in all competitions and sit three points behind league leaders Arsenal in third. Chelsea are fifth before Sunday's games.",

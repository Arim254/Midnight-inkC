    "body": "16 hours agoEmily Holt & Yasmin RufoBBC NewsBBCWe all want hair that looks and feels healthy, whether that means glossy waves, bouncy curls or sleek and smooth strands. In an industry worth £5.8bn in the UK, there are endless products, trends and TikTok hacks flying around which makes it's easy to lose sight of the basics.The truth is, healthy hair isn't about spending a fortune or following complicated routines, it's about getting the simple stuff right.Trichologists Eva Proudman from UK Hair Consultants and Tracey Walker from Hair and Scalp Clinic, bust four common myths about how to look after your hair. 1. Cold water doesn't make your hair shinier Getty ImagesEver shivered your way through an icy shower just for the sake of shinier hair? Well luckily you can stop doing that and enjoy a warm and comfortable wash as Proudman says cold water doesn't add any extra shine to your hair. \"There's no need to wash your hair in freezing cold water as it does nothing,\" she says. \"What's much more important is how you protect your hair from chemicals, heat and the environment you're in.She does add that you don't want to wash you hair in too hot water though as it can dehydrate your hair and can scald the scalp in the same way hot water scalds our skin.2. No product can repair damaged hair Getty ImagesIf you're someone who hopes to fix their split ends without a visit to the hairdressers, you'll be disappointed to know a haircut is the only solution.Proudman explains a split end is similar to a ladder in tights - there's simply no way to mend it.Walker says: \"If you imagine a hair is fracturing and if you look at it under the microscope, it almost looks like there's two or three more prongs to the hair.\"Products on the market act as a kind of glue which puts the hair back together again so it looks better.\"She says these are temporary fixes, and warns not to get lulled into spending a lot of money on products which promise a solution.Proudman also says claims that cutting your hair can make it grow faster are untrue.\"It's just not possible to make your hair grow quicker so any product claiming that is lying.\"Other stories you may enjoy3. Your hair won't self-clean  Getty ImagesYou may well have met someone who swears they've managed to train their hair to \"self-clean\" allowing them to wash it infrequently or not at all. But Proudman says doing this is absolutely not good for your hair. \"Your scalp has 180,000 oil glands and it collects dirt and debris if it's not regularly washed.\" Walker agrees and likens it to the fact you can't remove an oily or dirty mark from clothes with just water, you need detergent too. Not washing your hair regularly can cause a smell as well as a worsening of scalp conditions such as dandruff, she says because \"leaving the hair to become oilier can let yeast and bacteria build, making itchy scalp conditions worse\".Proudman recommends washing your hair every other day if your hair is very oily or you use a lot of product in it.  Laura Waters, Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis at University of Huddersfield, says while those with very oily hair might benefit from stronger cleansing, people with drier hair could consider a sulfate-free shampoo which is more expensive but won't strip oil out of it.4. Dry shampoo isn't a substitute for washingGetty ImagesFinding time for a full wash, blow-dry and style isn't always realistic so between work, workouts and social plans, many of us reach for dry shampoo as a quick fix to revive greasy roots and refresh our hair without hopping in the shower. Proudman says dry shampoo is \"absolutely fine\", but that it should be used only once between hair washes. The problem arises when you use it for multiple days in a row without washing it out. \"The natural oil of the scalp sinks into the shampoo and the yeast will feed on the build up,\" Proudman says. \"If you're not careful you'll get an itchy and flaky scalp.\"Ultimately her advice is to focus on looking after your scalp in the same way you look after your face - you wouldn't keep piling makeup onto your skin without removing what's underneath and washing it first.

    "body": "2 hours agoSean Seddon and Dominic Casciani,Home and Legal CorrespondentA migrant has returned to the UK on a small boat after being removed to France under the \"one in, one out\" scheme less than a month ago, BBC News understands.The Guardian newspaper reported that the man claimed to have been been a victim of modern slavery at the hands of smuggling gangs in France.The Home Office declined to directly confirm the report but said a migrant had been detained and their removal was being sought as soon as possible.Forty two people who arrived in the UK illegally have been removed so far under the scheme in which the UK agrees to take in asylum seekers who have a case for protection.The BBC understands the man is an Iranian national, and was initially detained on 6 August and was removed on 19 September, becoming the third person to be sent to France under the scheme. He returned four days ago on 18 October.The male migrant - who the Guardian has not named -  told the newspaper he returned to the UK because he feared for his life in France.Speaking about his alleged treatments at the hands of smugglers, he said: \"They took me like a worthless object, forced me to work, abused me, and threatened me with a gun and told me I would be killed if I made the slightest protest.\"Asked about the report, a Home Office spokesperson said: \"We will not accept any abuse of our borders, and we will do everything in our power to remove those without the legal right to be here.\"Individuals who are returned under the pilot and subsequently attempt to re-enter the UK illegally will removed.\"The scheme, which was announced in July, is intended to deter people from crossing the Channel and encourage migrants to make asylum claims on the continent. Twenty three people have returned to France.Under the treaty, France agreed to take back migrants who had travelled to the UK by small boat and had their asylum claim rejected.For each person returned to France, the UK has agreed to accept someone with a case for protection as a refugee who has not attempted to cross the Channel.On Sunday, the Home Office said 16 people had been removed to France on a single flight, the largest group removal under the scheme yet.As at 21 October, 36,734 people had arrived in the UK by small boat in 2025.That's 8,530 more than at the same point in 2024, but 869 lower than at the same point in 2022, the highest year on record.Home Office figures show that there were no crossings on six out of the last seven days but that 369 made the journey on 18 October.",

    "body": "5 hours agoAdina Campbell,UK correspondent and Jemma Crew,BBC NewsPA MediaPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer met Claire Throssell, who has campaigned for the change, on TuesdayFamily court law will be changed so it is no longer based on the idea that contact with both parents is usually in a child's best interest, the government has saidNew evidence shows that assuming it is always best for a child to have both parents involved in their life can perpetuate abuse, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.It is not known when the law will change, but the move has been welcomed by domestic abuse charities.The move follows campaigning by Claire Throssell, whose sons Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, were killed by their father in a house fire he started 11 years ago this week in Yorkshire.He had been allowed to spend time with his children, despite previous threats to kill them and himself.Currently, the law presumes contact with both parents is usually in the best interests of a child, with safeguards to restrict involvement where it is detrimental to a child's welfare.But the government says it will now repeal that law under the 1989 Children Act which should lead to quicker decisions to restrict contact with abusive parents.Ms Throssell, who is an ambassador for the charity Women's Aid, said successive governments had failed children by standing by the \"outdated presumption\" that contact with both parents was in their best interest.While it does not feel like a \"win\", she said the change \"will save so many children's lives\".Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, alongside a photograph of her boys that she brought into the studio, Ms Throssell said she had made a promise to her son Paul as he lay dying in her arms more than a decade ago. She met Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday, who said he would deliver on it.She told the programme: \"I've waited 11 years, I don't want to wait 11 more.\"Let's be honest, for 30 years the family courts have let down children, have failed to protect them, have failed to see, hear, believe and support them. They mustn't be allowed to fail them for 30 more. I hope it goes through as quickly as possible next year.\"Praising Ms Throssell's \"relentless advocacy for children's safety\", Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy said: \"As we mark this important step forward in the law, I pay tribute to her sons, Jack and Paul, whose memory drives our commitment to ensuring no other child suffers a similar fate.\"The MoJ said it will legislate to repeal the presumption of parental involvement when parliamentary time allows.Farah Nazeer, Women's Aid chief executive, said the organisation \"warmly welcomes\" the move.She said: \"Changes to the presumption are an important first step but with the existing 'pro-contact' culture being deep-rooted in the family courts, comprehensive action needs to be taken to overturn these dangerous attitudes and beliefs that are putting lives at risk.\"Earlier this week the government also announced plans to automatically restrict parental responsibility for rapists whose crimes resulted in the birth of a child and parents who committed serious sex offences against any children.The MoJ said the plans were a crucial part of the government's mission to halve violence against women and girls within a decade.",

    "body": "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has said Israel is obliged to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip by the United Nations and its entities to ensure the basic needs of the Palestinian civilians are met.An advisory opinion from the UN's top court also said Israel had not substantiated its allegations that the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) lacked neutrality or that a significant number of its staff were members of Hamas or other armed groups. Unrwa has denied the claims.Israel rejected the opinion as \"political\" and insisted it would not co-operate with Unrwa.The opinion is non-binding, but it carries significant moral and diplomatic weight.The UN General Assembly asked the ICJ in December for an opinion on Israel's legal obligations towards UN agencies and international organisations operating in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.It came after the Israeli parliament passed laws banning any activity by Unrwa on Israeli territory and contact with Israeli officials.The ICJ was asked to also cover in its opinion Israel's duty to allow the unhindered delivery of essential supplies to Palestinian civilians.Israel tightened its blockade on Gaza after the start of its war with Hamas two years ago and has since restricted - and at times completely stopped - the entry of food and other aid for the 2.1 million population.Before this month's ceasefire deal took effect, UN-backed global experts had estimated that more than 640,000 people were facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity and that there was an \"entirely man-made\" famine in Gaza City. Israel rejected the famine declaration, insisting it was allowing in sufficient food.The ICJ's advisory opinion was \"entirely predictable from the outset regarding Unrwa\", the Israeli foreign ministry said on Wednesday.\"This is yet another political attempt to impose political measures against Israel under the guise of 'international law,'\" it added.Unrwa's acting Gaza director, Sam Rose, told the BBC that the agency welcomed the ICJ's opinion because it \"underscores the obligations of Israel under international law\". \"The ruling of today says that Israel's laws against Unrwa have gone against those obligations, as have its actions on the ground,\" he said.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline HalpertIs Trump allowed to demolish part of the White House to build a ballroom?US President Donald Trump has defended his decision to demolish part of the White House East Wing to build a ballroom, calling the construction \"music to my ears\", despite mounting criticism of the project.Speaking to senators from his Republican Party at the White House on Tuesday, Trump also said: \"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction in the back... When I hear that sound, it reminds me of money.\" Trump, a former property developer, is spending $250m (£186m) on a new, 90,000 sq ft (8,360 sq m) ballroom to host parties, state visits and other events. But since work began on Monday, a number of critics have spoken out - among them his one-time rival, Hillary Clinton.Also on Tuesday, the leader of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a Washington non-profit organisation that protects historic US sites, wrote a letter to White House officials saying she was \"deeply concerned\" by the project. The letter said the size of the new construction would \"overwhelm the White House itself... and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings\". The trust asked Trump to pause demolition work, arguing that the White House was a national historic landmark and that officials needed to hold a public review process of the plan for the ballroom. Another group, the Society of Architectural Historians, also said it had \"great concerns\" about the project, similarly calling for a review process because of the size of the planned construction. The White House has hit back at its critics, writing in a news release that \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\". Trump officials have also insisted that the renovation will not cost US taxpayers any money, and that there is nothing inappropriate about soliciting private donations to help pay for it, as Trump has been doing.Who is paying for the new White House ballroom?Many Democrats have also lambasted the renovation, including Clinton, who ran against Trump for the US presidency in 2016. Addressing her followers on X, she wrote that the White House was not Trump's house. \"It's your house. And he's destroying it.\" Since it was built in the late 1700s, the White House has undergone a number of renovations and restorations. In 1948, then-President Harry Truman gutted the inside of the White House as it was at risk of collapsing, adding a balcony to the exterior. Over the years, presidents have added swimming pools, bowling alleys and other touches - though critics have highlighted that Trump's additions appear to be the biggest alterations to the White House exterior in decades. White House officials have said the project does not require sign-off from the National Capital Planning Commission, an agency that oversees construction and renovations to government buildings in Washington and is chaired by a Trump aid. But a former chair of the commission, L Preston Bryant Jr, told the Associated Press that previous administrations have worked closely with the agency on big construction projects, starting with an \"early consultation\" before the renovation began.

    "body": "6 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere's relief for many today that inflation didn't hit the feared 4% last month - relief for households, the government and the Bank of England.But at 3.8% in the year to September, inflation remains considerably above the Bank's target and while that persists, consumers may remain jittery about spending, uneasy about the future path of prices. After all, during the spike in inflation a couple of years back, they experienced the equivalent of more than a typical decade's worth of price rises in just two years. They, and their finances, are scarred.And inflation in some areas such as services - think hotels and restaurants - remains stubborn. Sectors such as hospitality are most likely to have seen their wage bills rise substantially - analysts suggest by as much as 10% - due to government policies such as higher minimum wages and tax increases over the past year.But there are signs that things are settling down - food prices eased for the first time in months in September, as the impact of higher commodity prices fades a little. While food makes up a relatively small part of the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, it is the most visible form of price rises. Meanwhile, economists feel that the impact of some of the other higher costs firms have been passing on may be peaking. Economists expect inflation to fall back towards the 2% target next year.And remember, on average wage rises are comfortably outpacing inflation, so the cost-of-living squeeze is easing for many, even if it may not feel like it. Plus, traditionally these figures are used to uprate many benefits for working age people - some may see an increase of about 6% in their universal credit payments next spring.Following the release of the latest inflation figures, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she was not satisfied with progress so far in bearing down on price rises. She went on to hint at help to come in November's Budget, with, we understand, some relief expected on energy bills. Businesses, however, remain cautious - some retailers are warning that further tax rises in the Budget may cause a resurgence in inflationary pressures. And until the Bank of England feels that inflation is firmly under control, it's always going to be cautious about cutting interest rates. So while there's still unlikely to be a cut in rates in November, analysts think there may be a growing chance of a \"Santa cut\" in December - just in time for Christmas. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoImran Rahman-JonesTechnology reporterPA MediaApple may have to allow rivals to operate their own app stores on iPhones in the UK, after a ruling from the competition regulator. This would be a significant change to Apple's infamous \"closed system\" where apps can only be downloaded from its own App Store.But the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has designated both Apple and Google as having \"strategic market status\" - effectively saying they have a lot of power over mobile platforms.The ruling has drawn fury from the tech giants, with Apple saying it risked harming consumers through \"weaker privacy\" and \"delayed access to new features\", while Google called the decision \"disappointing, disproportionate and unwarranted\". The CMA said the two companies \"may be limiting innovation and competition\".But the regulator said it did not \"find or assume wrongdoing\" from the firms.\"The app economy generates 1.5% of the UK's GDP and supports around 400,000 jobs, which is why it's crucial these markets work well for business,\" said Will Hayter, the CMA's executive director for digital markets.\"Around 90-100% of UK mobile devices running on Apple or Google's mobile platforms,\" the CMA has previously said, adding this meant the firms \"hold an effective duopoly\".According to analysis from Uswitch, 48.5% of UK mobile owners use an iPhone - which runs Apple's iOS operating system (OS) - with the vast majority of the rest using Google's Android OS.It comes after a separate decision taken in October, where the CMA designated Google's search division as having strategic market status. Apple hits backThe CMA's investigation focused on how prominent Apple and Google's own apps are compared with rivals - as well as their browsers and operating systems.It is unknown what changes the regulator will look to request, but in July it published roadmaps outlining potential measures it could take.These include requiring it to be easier for people to easily switch between Apple and Android devices, and for both firms to rank apps \"in a fair, objective and transparent manner\" in their app stores.Apple specifically may be required to allow alternative app stores on its devices, and let people download programs directly from companies' websites.This would follow a similar ruling in the European Union (EU), which fined Apple in April, accusing it of anti-competitive behaviour.Apple warned the UK could lose access to getting new features - as has happened in the EU - which the company blames on heavy regulation.For example, some Apple Intelligence features which have been rolled out in other parts of the world are not available in the EU.\"Apple faces fierce competition in every market where we operate, and we work tirelessly to create the best products, services and user experience,\" the company said in a statement. \"The UK's adoption of EU-style rules would undermine that, leaving users with weaker privacy and security, delayed access to new features, and a fragmented, less seamless experience.\"Google also lividAndroid users can currently use third-party app stores - though critics say they are not as smooth as Google's own Play Store.The CMA's roadmap said Google may have to \"change the user experience\" of downloading apps directly from websites, as well as \"remove user frictions\" when using alternative app stores, such as listing them directly on the Google Play Store.\"We simply do not see the rationale for today's designation decision,\" Google competition lead Oliver Bethell said.Mr Bethell said \"the majority of Android users\" use alternative app stores or download apps directly from a developer's website, and claimed there is a far greater range of apps available for Android users compared to those on Apple devices.\"There are now 24,000 Android phone models from 1,300 phone manufacturers worldwide, facing intense competition from iOS in the UK,\" he said.Android is an open-source operating system, which means developers can use and build on top of it for free.Google argues this means it opens up competition.But consumer group Which? said curbs on these companies' power in other countries \"are already helping businesses to innovate and giving consumers more choice\".\"Their dominance is now causing real harm by restricting choice for consumers and competition for businesses,\" said its head of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha.

    "body": "11 hours agoSima Kotecha,senior UK correspondent and Myranda MowafiBBCMore than 300 people have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, corruption and bullying of victims by police after a Panorama undercover investigation.The secret filming over seven months revealed evidence of racism, misogyny and officers revelling in the use of force at one of London's busiest police stations.One of the main themes among the hundreds of people getting in touch was misogyny when they reported domestic abuse and sexual violence - with some women saying reporting their rape to police \"was like being raped again\".In response to the latest allegations, the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) said it was \"working hard to build a culture based on integrity and trust\" and improving vetting and misconduct procedures.We have spoken to many of the women who contacted us through Your Voice, Your BBC News with stories of mistreatment, whose experiences span police forces across England - from rural counties to big cities. We have changed their names to protect their identities.A police officer allegedly told Joanna to \"grow a pair\" when she reported being punched in the face by her partner several months ago, she told us.Her partner had been drinking excessively when he returned home and angrily attacked her, she says. She found herself at the local police station in tears.\"I was devastated and the police made it 10 times worse. My face had a bruise from the punch and one of the officers looked at me as if I was exaggerating the whole thing,\" she said.\"He told me to grow a pair... followed by a chuckle. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It took so much to go there in the first place and then I wished I hadn't.\"Unmasked: Secret BBC filming exposes hidden culture of misogyny and racism inside Met PoliceWhy BBC sent undercover reporter into a busy London police stationMet officers face fast-track hearings after Panorama investigationOne woman was motivated to get in touch with the BBC by a scene Panorama filmed of a Metropolitan Police officer being dismissive of a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence. The officer said of her account to a colleague: \"That's what she says.\"Ava was also pregnant when she fled her abusive partner, who she says repeatedly raped and hit her. She said the treatment and attitude of the officers she met that night meant she would never turn to the police in future.She said she was devastated that they did not believe her, telling her that \"nobody gets raped more than once\".\"It was like being raped all over again,\" she said. \"What they put me through was worse than what I was going through before\".Sgt Joe McIlvenny was filmed dismissing an alleged rape victim's testimonyAva says evidence that would have supported her case was \"wilfully ignored\" and she was told that without CCTV evidence of an attack, \"it is just your word against his\".She believes being a black woman made matters worse.\"The colour of my skin meant everything was stacked against me. The language they used and how dismissive and mocking they were, was both misogynist and racist,\" she said.\"They asked why I thought he was doing it to me - as if I was the problem, as if I'd brought it all on myself.\"Policing Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC that the government would not tolerate these \"sickening comments\" and urged people to report them.She said police chiefs had been given new powers to dismiss officers who commit gross misconduct. \"We will root out those unfit to serve the public,\" she said.Another woman, Claire, told us how she escaped her abusive former partner, who had coercively controlled her for 12 years, only to find that police did not want to get involved when he breached court orders to stay away from her.On one occasion, her former partner entered her home and locked her out, despite an injunction banning him from the property.She said it took the police more than seven hours to arrive and then \"they just stood laughing and chatting with him\". She and her three children ended up having to stay with a friend for months.\"I felt even more afraid and more isolated after speaking to the police. It's a boys' club - a network across police stations, police forces and county lines,\" Claire said.\"I would never call the police and I still worry he'll find me and show up.\"Getty ImagesCharing Cross station was the focus of the BBC's investigation, but the latest allegations come from across EnglandA training programme called Domestic Abuse Matters was developed by the College of Policing in 2016. It is used by 37 out of 44 police forces in England and Wales to improve the way they deal with victims of sexual and domestic violence.And part of the NPCC and College of Policing strategy on violence against women and girls says that one of its priorities is to challenge sexism and misogyny among officers.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Millichap, NPCC lead for violence against women and girls, told the BBC police chiefs were working with survivors of domestic abuse and sexual offences to continue to reform training, \"with a key focus on first responders' understanding of the dynamics of abuse and their empathy with victims\".She said \"officers must feel confident in calling out misogyny and sexism within policing\" but that improved vetting and misconduct procedures were \"having an impact in identifying and dismissing those who should not be in policing\".One of the women who contacted the BBC said that having watched the Panorama programme, she was shocked that nothing had changed in the decades since she was raped as a teenager.\"I have never had a night without a nightmare as a result, I've buried a lot of what the police officers asked me. They spoke down to me - like I was part of the problem,\" the woman, now in her 40s, said.\"Watching Panorama, I realised I must be one of thousands, I'm not the only one.

    "body": "1 hour agoCachella SmithAFP via Getty ImagesPrince Andrew should be called in front of MPs to give evidence about his lease of Royal Lodge, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said.It follows calls for greater transparency into royal finances and the independently-run Crown Estate, which leased Andrew his mansion in Windsor.Sir Ed called for a select committee inquiry to \"properly scrutinise\" the Crown Estate, with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer replying that it was important there was proper scrutiny of all Crown properties.Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.While there is nothing preventing a House of Commons committee from inviting Prince Andrew to give evidence, an appearance in such a setting by a member of the Royal Family would be unprecedented. It is unclear whether the committee would be able to compel him to do so.There has been increased focus on Prince Andrew - who had already stepped back as a working royal - after he relinquished his titles last week following growing pressure over his links with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Sir Ed's question came after a document seen by BBC News confirmed the arrangement for the Royal Lodge means that the prince has only ever paid a token annual rent on property, and that it might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate.The deal meant that, instead of paying annual rent, Prince Andrew made large lump sum payments upfront, including for renovations.In effect, those payments - which totalled about £8m - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the 75-year lease.Part of the deal was that if he left early in the lease he could reclaim some of the money he had paid upfront, with that amount tapering down over time until 25 years - at the current rate, it is about £186,000 for each remaining year until 2028.Former Crown Estate commissioner Lord Curry told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley the estate would be \"honour bound to honour that lease\" and that any inquiry would be a \"waste of time and money\".\"There's nothing they can do about the lease without reneging on its terms, and that would be inappropriate,\" he said.The Crown Estate is a property business owned by the monarch but run independently, with profits from it going to the Treasury. The level of profit is used as a benchmark to calculate the funding given by the government to the Royal Family in the Sovereign Grant.Baroness Margaret Hodge, who chaired the Public Accounts Committee between 2010 and 2015, said the Royal Lodge arrangement \"looks like a rotten deal\".\"The Royal Lodge is run by the Crown Estate [which] is under a duty to maximise the income it collects because that goes to the taxpayer,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday.She also made a call for greater transparency regarding royal finances generally.\"We don't know,\" she underlined, \"there's no transparency - so inevitably we're sceptical and we ask questions\".\"All we've got here is another specific issue which is an example of a much much wider problem which is that the royal finances are mired in secrecy and that lack of transparency associated with those finances ends up with us asking all sorts of questions.\"The Royal Family has three main funding streams in addition to private income.The Sovereign Grant is funded by the taxpayer while the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall provide income for the King and the Prince of Wales respectively.Annual financial statements from the Royal Family include details on the Sovereign Grant - which funds official duties, the maintenance of the Occupied Royal Palaces and more recently has funded the Buckingham Palace Reservicing Programme. Separate reports are published for the two duchies which are described on their respective websites as private estates.Baroness Hodge said: \"There is this muddy territory [...] in my view, they are public because they were given by the State to the Royal Family for the purpose of sustaining themselves.\"The Duchy of Cornwall's official site said the Prince of Wales pays income tax on this income - which is not a requirement, but something he does voluntarily.The King also voluntarily pays income tax on the Duchy of Lancaster.The King ended financial support for Prince Andrew last year as he faced increasing public scrutiny over his links with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The prince announced he would stop using his Duke of York title earlier this month – however York MP Rachael Maskell, who had the Labour whip suspended in July, is introducing a proposal to the House of Commons on Wednesday for a new law which would enable the King to remove titles.This proposal would give the King the power to formally strip the prince of the dukedom.The Removal of Titles Bill was already introduced in parliament in 2022 and would require the support of government to become law.This week has also seen the publication of the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Prince Andrew had sex with her at Ghislaine Maxwell's house when she was 17. Andrew has always denied the allegations.Separately, in the US, a senior member of the US House Oversight Committee Stephen Lynch told the BBC's Newsnight the committee \"would be extremely interested in hearing from Prince Andrew regarding his involvement in all of this\".The committee has been considering documents from the Epstein case and releasing certain documents to the public in recent months.Asked whether he would issue that invitation, Mr Lynch responded: \"We will I'm sure.\"One of Epstein's accusers, Annie Farmer, told Newsnight separately that she is not \"holding [her] breath\" that Prince Andrew would share further information with the authorities.However, she added: \"This is a moment. If he wants to do right by Virginia and the rest of us, he could do something different and say, I have information I want to share because I believe it could be helpful.\"",

    "body": "Which benefits are going up and by how much?2 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness ReporterGetty ImagesThe cost of living is always important to our finances, but this month what is happening to prices will have a particular extra impact for millions of people.The September inflation figure reflects what has been happening to prices over the past year, and will affect how far your money goes and how much benefits will go up next year as well as influencing the Bank of England's interest rate decisions.It also comes just over a month before the Budget, with the chancellor confirming she has been looking at further measures on tax and spending.Here are some of the ways in which the latest inflation figure will directly affect you and your money. Universal credit and other benefitsTypically, September's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, which this time is 3.8%, is the benchmark for raising benefits the following April.Some benefits, including all the main disability benefits, such as personal independence payment, attendance allowance and disability living allowance, as well as carer’s allowance, will rise by at least as much as prices have been rising. That is a legal requirement.Universal credit (UC) - which is the most common benefit, claimed by seven and a half million people - is expected to rise by more than inflation next year. But ministers have the final say.Currently UC is expected to rise by about 6.2%, reflecting the 3.8% September inflation figure, plus an additional 2.3% uplift already outlined in government legislation.That would mean the standard UC allowance would rise from £92 to £98 per week for single claimants, and from £145 to £154 per week for couples, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation calculates.Bigger increase for the state pensionThe state pension rise is set using different criteria: what is known as the triple lock.Under that arrangement, the state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, or by inflation, or by earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure. This time around, we now know, that average earnings growth is the highest of these, at 4.8%.This means:The full, new flat-rate state pension (for those who reached state pension age after April 2016) is expected to increase from its current £230.30 a week to £241.30 a week. That will take it to £12,547 a year.The full, old basic state pension (for those who reached state pension age before April 2016) is expected to go up from £176.45 a week to £184.90. That will take it to £9,615 a year.Not all pensioners receive the full state pension, and some rely on other benefit income.Wages and pricesStubbornly rising prices in the UK over the past year mean that everyone's incomes are stretched further.Rising wages can help counter that, putting more money in peoples' pockets so that even if prices are higher, their spending power doesn't fall.However, the poverty-focused think tank the Resolution Foundation says pay growth has been weakening. It calculates that weekly wages have grown \"by no more than the price of a Gregg's sausage roll\", or £1.50, over the past 11 months.Workers on the government-set minimum wage have fared better following inflation-busting rises in April.Interest and mortgage rate cuts more likelyGetty ImagesInflation remains well above the Bank of England's 2% target. But September's 3.8% figure was lower than the 4% the Bank of England and other economists had forecast. So speculation is growing that another interest rate cut could be on the cards.Usually the Bank of England keeps interest rates higher if inflation is causing concern, to discourage borrowing and spending that can make the problem worse.If inflation seems to be easing, there could be a rate cut as soon as November or December, some economists suggest, which would make it cheaper to borrow, including for mortgages.An easing of mortgage costs would be welcomed not only by homeowners but also by renters. Lower costs for landlords might help put a stop to persistent rises in rents.On the other hand, lower Bank of England interest rates can mean lower rates for savers, too.Implications for the BudgetAll eyes are now on the chancellor who is busy finalising her Budget set for 26 November.Rachel Reeves said she wasn't satisfied with a slightly smaller than expected rise in prices in September and planned to take action to bring inflation down further. There have been hints that might come through lower household energy bills.But the prospect of easing inflation could also throw her a lifeline as she battles to make the numbers add up without breaking manifesto promises on borrowing and taxation.It will mean welfare spending, and other government costs, are lower than they might have been. And borrowing costs for the government itself are already edging downwards, all of which would give her more room for manoeuvre.",

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, Lando Norris won the 2025 drivers' championship by two points from Max VerstappenByF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiThe adrenaline beginning to drain out of him, but the euphoria of winning a first world title still very much present, Lando Norris was in reflective mood as he discussed what achieving his lifetime's ambition meant to him.\"I just won it my way,\" the McLaren driver said. \"I'm happy I could go out and be myself.\"\"I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I'm not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max [Verstappen] or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past – whatever it may be. My style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member.\"The 26-year-old Briton did a lot of talking after climbing out of his car in Abu Dhabi,  where his third-place finish in the 2025 season finale ensured he beat Verstappen to the championship by just two points. That is the way of things in F1, where drivers have to finish their media commitments before getting down to the business of celebrating their success.Among the thousands of words that came out of Norris' mouth, these were among the most fitting comments at the end of a season that has in many ways reflected his journey to the top.It has not been easy. There have been bumps in the road. Some even feel Red Bull's Verstappen would have been a more worthy champion, given his revival in the final third of the season.While Verstappen mounted one of the all-time great comebacks from the start of September, Norris weathered an early rough patch, and rode his own concurrent wave of momentum to achieve his lifetime's ambition in a race that, while tense, always felt like he had it under control.After he celebrated on the podium, where he was drenched in champagne by race-winner Verstappen and McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, as the three title contenders finished at the front just as they had started the race, you could almost feel Norris coming to terms with his achievement in real time as he discussed how he had got to where he had.There were some very touching comments about how much it meant to him to make so many people who were important to him happy, especially his parents and his colleagues at McLaren.\"I feel proud but not because I'm going to wake up tomorrow and go, 'I beat everyone,'\" he said. \"I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy.\"And as he talked, he began to open up on who he is, his honesty, his determination to be true to himself and his wish to be open about his feelings, even the difficult ones, a trait for which he has been criticised from time to time.\"Could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done,\" he said.\"I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that's why I'm very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am.\"'The struggles turned into strength'Norris started the season as favourite, after McLaren's strong end to 2024, but after winning the first race, he went through a rough patch and Piastri moved into a comfortable lead.Norris was not at one with the car, was finding it difficult to feel the front axle when he was trying to take it to the limit in qualifying. That led to mistakes - even a big crash in Saudi Arabia - and when you start behind in modern F1, you tend to finish there.But he and McLaren worked at it. The team came up with a tweak to the front suspension aimed at improving feel. It was a small thing. It made a small difference, but a barely perceptible one.From there, he slowly improved, began to build momentum, but it was more about the work he was putting in behind the scenes.He knew what he needed to be better at, and he worked on it, on adapting to the car, on not being alarmed that it felt slightly different from what he wanted.It was a mental approach as much as a change in driving, and slowly it began to make a difference.\"It started after I had that kind of bad run in race two, three, four, five, six, that kind of area,\" he said. \"Or certainly when it was like, 'All right, my way is not working. I've got to understand things differently. I've got to speak to more people. I've got to understand what I'm thinking, why I'm thinking it. Why am I doing this? Why am I getting tense in qualifying? Why am I making the decisions that I'm making?' Whatever it may be.\"Certainly, the bad run of results and lack of performance - not speed, because I think the speed's always there - but lack of putting things together when I had the capability of putting things together, allowed or opened up the doors to go and understand: \"OK, I need to do more than just try again next weekend. I need to try and understand things on a deeper level.'\"That opened up understanding myself more, understanding things more at a championship level. That's the level I've got to be at. \"And yes, certainly the struggles turned into strength. So I would say, if I didn't have those struggles at the beginning and then had the weakness at the end, would I have caught on to those things as quickly? Probably not.\"Media caption, A young Norris shares ambition to be world championHe was 34 points adrift of Piastri after the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, with only nine races remaining. That was when the run of form that ultimately took him to the title started.But while the outside perception was that this had freed Norris up and allowed him to just go for it, he says it was the opposite.\"No, it didn't allow me to relax,\" he said. \"Thirty-four points against a guy who had the same car, who was doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly great, it didn't fill me with confidence and (make me) think I have nothing to lose now.\"I just had to step up, what I was doing away from the track, the people I was working with. I had to involve people to that group, I had to work harder, I was on a simulator, I had to change my approaches, I had to change my style of driving, I had to dig deep, to unlock more of my ideas.\"I'm trying to understand more things quicker, in a more advanced way than I ever have before.\"Team principal Andrea Stella said: \"The level of Formula 1 drivers nowadays is so high, to compete at this level, the only way to stay in the quest is to keep evolving continuously.\"If I look at Lando, definitely there was a lot that was taken away from the quest last year, even if it didn't go to the last race. I think Lando elevated his sense of, almost his status, like, 'I can compete with Max.'\"This season there was another important turning point, which is the way Lando, and we talk specifically about him for a moment, responded to the difficulties we had at the start of the season. There was the start of a process which was structured, it was holistic, it was involving the personal development, professional, driving, racecraft.\"It makes me particularly glad that Lando could capitalise on this, because this has been something that not necessarily I've seen many times before, in terms of the amount of work, the people involved, and the rate of development.\"For Stella's boss, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, this was a personal achievement as well as a professional one. Brown started backing Norris on a management level when he was 14, supported him through the junior ranks and brought him to McLaren.\"I remember when he was about that big. The management he has around him have done an awesome job bringing him up to be the mature world champion that he now is. And it's a great accomplishment. It's very rewarding.\"'I missed Lando growing up'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris embraces his mother Cisca with his manager Mark Berryman in the backgroundFor his family, there have been sacrifices, as his Belgian mother Cisca told BBC Radio 5 Live after the race.\"It's overwhelming, emotionally draining,\" she said, \"but we backed Lando during all the good and bad times. We always stood on his side, and not just Lando, but it was all the children. It's a dream come true for Lando.\"We didn't push the children; they had chosen what they wanted to do, and we supported them. It does take sacrifices, because the girls and the boys have been growing up almost separate. It was passing ships in the night. They chose what they wanted to do and we supported it.\"It takes its toll because I missed Lando growing up. When he was eight, he started to compete. It took him all over the place, but Adam (Norris' dad) stood on his side, and I missed him badly. I am still missing him. I don't see him often. \"He can do what he wants. He is a grown-up man, and the last six months, he has changed and become stronger in his mind as well.\"As he came to the end of his remarks post-race, Norris was still reflecting on the difficulties, and how they had helped turn adversity into the ultimate success.\"If I look back at it from the first half of the season,\" he said, \"not the most impressive.\"Certainly times I've made some mistakes, I've made some bad judgments, I've made my errors.\"But how I managed to turn all of that, and have the second half of the season that I had, is what makes me very proud, that I've been able to prove myself wrong. That makes me very happy.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris' McLaren team have won the constructors' championship in the past two seasons",

    "body": "It will go down as one of the most explosive interviews in the Premier League era.Liverpool's Mohamed Salah stunned most people on Saturday evening when he claimed his relationship with manager Arne Slot had \"broken down\".The Egyptian, arguably one of the Premier League's greatest players, cranked up the pressure on Slot after spending the third game in a row on the substitutes bench, as Liverpool let a lead slip twice in a 3-3 draw with Leeds.Claims such as he had been 'thrown under the bus' and that 'someone didn't want him at the club' were probably the last thing Slot wanted to hear put into the public, especially after a forgettable run of form that leaves the champions ninth in the Premier League.But what now for Salah at Liverpool? The 33-year-old only signed a new two-year deal in April but admitted on Saturday he was unsure whether he had played his last game for the club.BBC Sport takes a closer look at what happens next to the player who has scored 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances.Salah rarely speaks to the media but when he does it is typically because he has something important to say.That approach was taken to a new level with Saturday's explosive comments.When he was approached in the mixed zone at Elland Road, he was clear with reporters that he wanted to speak to them.It's unclear whether this was on the spur of the moment out of frustration or something more calculated.His comments quickly went around the world and put Liverpool head coach Slot under increased pressure and scrutiny.On Sunday, in the aftermath, there was little sign that there was any regret or walking back from what Salah said.Sources with knowledge of the situation told BBC Sport that Salah's relationship with Slot is genuinely broken at present.They said he simply doesn't see a future at Liverpool with Slot as his manager. That is quite the turnaround from a Premier League title won just eight months ago shortly after a lucrative new contract was announced.Sources say that Salah has also been irritated by a feeling that pundits and former players are putting forward a narrative that he is one of the main reasons Liverpool have struggled this season. Salah is said to feel that Slot has been influenced by that media commentary – yet when he has not played the Reds arguably haven't played any better.We were told that Salah feels a different tactical approach this season driven by the club's transfer dealings isn't suiting him.Those sources were at pains to say how much Salah loves Liverpool and also how frustrated he has become at their struggles.BBC Sport was told on Saturday that Liverpool are open-minded about Salah's future amid Saudi interest. Al-Hilal, managed by Simone Inzaghi, are understood to be among the teams interested.It is believed that there have been no concrete talks as yet. At present, it seems Salah is keeping his options open, and it is a busy time for him with Africa Cup of Nations duty beckoning on Monday 15 December.Liverpool fans - and the world of football in general - will be waiting to find out the next installment with bated breath.And they aren't going to have very long to wait with Monday likely to be a key day.The Reds are due to have an open training session on Monday morning, ahead of Tuesday's important Champions League match at Inter Milan, so all eyes will be on whether Salah is in attendance.We are yet to hear from Liverpool since, but the big question will be will Salah be travelling with the squad to Milan after open training?Slot is then expected to talk to the media for the first time since Salah's interview broke on Monday night, with all focus certain to be on their relationship. Was he surprised by the interview? Is there a way back for Salah?  Is he still in his plans for Tuesday night? All questions Slot will have to field in Milan.A day later, Liverpool will be facing Inter Milan looking for a win to move them back into the top eight of the Champions League - but will Salah be involved?The Reds then face Brighton at Anfield on Saturday, Salah's last match before he was due to meet up with the Egypt on Monday for the Africa Cup of Nations.Whether Salah will even be at Anfield is currently uncertain and, if he is, the reaction of the supporters towards his outburst would be very interesting.Whatever happens, you feel the next seven days will be very telling with regard his Liverpool future.Former England goalkeeper Rob Green, told BBC Radio 5 Live: He only ever speaks when it's going wrong for him or it's not going swimmingly. He's done it a few times after games and you just think maybe someone have a word in your ear. But what this does do is give Arne Slot an open goal now with whatever he wants to do. Now, with the Afcon coming up and with this outburst it's kind of a gift for Slot to say no one is bigger than the club, out you go.Or he can bring him back into the squad, nurse him back into the team but do it under his say so. The pressure is completely off Arne Slot now, really it's an error from Mo Salah because realistically with that draw (at Leeds) and the difficulty they are having this season, just stay quiet because the pressure grows, game by game that you don't play. This is Slot's to decide now. For me, Salah is an all-time great for Liverpool, for everything he's done. You're now saying you're going to leave at some point. It might be now, January might come around and they say it's best for all parties if you go now – it wouldn't surprise me if that happened.Former Newcastle and Man City goalkeeper Shay Given, told BBC Match of the Day: I felt for Mo Salah a little bit. When someone puts a microphone in front of you, it is a frustrating time for a sub not to play, especially a player of his calibre.The surprising thing that jumped off the page for me was why hasn't Arne Slot taken him into his office and had a sit down conversation with Mo Salah? This guy is a phenomenal player.I know Mo is probably angry and in the cold light of day shouldn't have said some of those things, but we have been there, you don't play, you are angry and frustrated and the team hasn't played well. Mo Salah has said himself he feels like the scapegoat.Former Germany and Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, on BBC Match of the Day:I think it was a little bit calculated but more his emotion. I think what he said was wrong and damage has been done.What they should do is sit down and speak to each other because it is not over yet. They all need to get together and say we can get this right. Damage has been done but I still think there is time to get it right but they have to do it quickly.BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Conor McNamara: At Elland Road it's very close. The press conference room is right near the player tunnel and players are always going out to the team buses, it's old school in that way. In the mixed zone where players walk through and normally they pretend to be on their phone to avoid speaking to the media, that's what usually happens. Mo Salah came out and had things to get off his chest. It ended up being there were more journalists out there than there were in the press conference where Arne Slot was speaking at the same time. This was all happening simultaneously but that immediately became the story that everyone was talking about last night.Ex-England striker Michael Owen, posted on X: Oh Mo Salah. I can imagine how you feel. You've carried this team for a long time and won everything there is to win. But this is a team game and you simply can't publicly say what you've said. You're going to afcon in a week. Surely you bite your lip, enjoy representing your country and see how the land lies when you get back?",

    "body": "Officials in California are urging people not to forage for wild mushrooms after a rise in poisoning cases caused at least one death. The California Poison Control System has identified 21 cases of amatoxin poisoning clustered in northern California, likely resulting from death cap mushrooms, the state's department of public health said. The poisoning resulted in severe liver damage in several people, including children, and at least one of the patients may need a liver transplant, the department said. Death cap mushrooms can easily be mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms because of their similar taste, smell, and appearance. The confirmed cases happened between mid-November and early December, a rainy season in the region that creates ideal conditions for the deadly variety to grow, mostly near oaks and hardwood trees like pine trees, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) said. Though the cases are mostly in the Monterey and San Francisco Bay area of Northern California, the risk is statewide, the department warned. \"Death cap mushrooms contain potentially deadly toxins that can lead to liver failure,\" Dr Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer, said in a statement. \"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season.\"The death cap mushroom is never safe to eat, even if it is boiled, dried, frozen or cooked. Eating the deadly mushrooms can cause watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration within six to 24 hours - and although symptoms may initially wane, severe or fatal liver damage can still occur up to eight days later. \"Only people with extensive training and experience should eat wild mushrooms that they have picked themselves,\" Dr Edward Moreno, County of Monterey Health Officer, said in a statement.

    "body": "33 minutes agoPaul SeddonandRachel Muller-HeyndykUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in London on Monday amid a continuing deadlock in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.Zelensky will attend the talks in Downing Street alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.Cabinet minister Pat McFadden said on Sunday that Ukraine's security and self-determination would be \"at the heart\" of the leaders' discussions in London. He said that US-led talks were at a \"really pivotal moment\".After three days of discussions in Miami, US President Donald Trump's outgoing Ukraine envoy said that a deal to end the war was \"really close\" but hinged on Russia's co-operation.Negotiations remain stuck on issues including the size of Ukraine's army after the conflict with Moscow ends and Russian control of the Donbas. \"If we get those two issues settled, I think the rest of the things will work out fairly well,\" US special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg told Reuters. \"We're almost there.\"Monday's in-person talks are the latest attempt by Ukraine's European allies to carve out a role in the ongoing efforts to end the war.Confirming the meeting on Sunday, Downing Street said the leaders would \"focus on the ongoing peace negotiations and next steps\", without providing details.The White House has been pushing Kyiv and Moscow to agree to a multi-point plan to end the war but there has been little sign of a breakthrough, despite both sides engaging with the process.The latest US-Ukraine talks concluded over the weekend - with Zelensky saying he was \"determined\" to continue working with the US after speaking to Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff.European leaders have pushed back against early versions of the US-led peace plan, which has since been revised after criticism it was too favourable towards Russia.It has sought to win US support for its own proposals, including a European-led security force to police any peace deal in Ukraine, an idea that has been rejected by Moscow. The original version of the US plan faced criticism from Ukraine and its allies for accepting Russian demands including on Nato involvement, restrictions to Ukraine's army and control of the eastern Donbas region. Russian President Vladimir Putin has in turn rejected the revisions.Despite blows to Russia's economy and heavy losses on the battlefield, Putin has been unwilling to compromise on key points. He has said Russia would take the Donbas by force if Ukraine did not cede control of the region, 85% of which is currently held by Russia. \"Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories,\" Putin said in an interview with India Today. While talks continued, Russia launched another large aerial bombardment on targets across Ukraine overnight into Sunday.Twenty-four hours earlier, Russia had launched 653 drones and 51 missiles on Ukraine, triggering air raid alerts across the country. Macron was among the European leaders to offer his \"full solidarity\" to Ukraine amid the attacks and that he would \"continue efforts with the Americans\" to secure peace. Meanwhile, the US National Security Strategy, which was unveiled last week, did not consider Russia to be a threat to Europe. Moscow responded that the strategy was consistent with its own vision and was a \"positive step\" forward. With further diplomatic negotiations on the horizon, EU officials have urged the US to keep historic ties between the two continents intact. \"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in response.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesByGyasi B-HibbertBBC NewsUpdated 11 minutes agoThe winter holiday period is meant to be joyful, yet for many of us it comes with a heavy mix of responsibilities and social pressure to go to parties and events we don't want to.Agreeing to something we don't want to do is a feeling that we've all experienced. It can manifest in physical responses like a tight stomach, a dry mouth, or even a higher heart rate.Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, hosts of the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, say they've both been affected. \"We both get the wobbly voice.It's so hard to go, 'actually, I don't want to do this thing you're asking me to do. I don't want to go along with the thing we're all expected to go along with,'\" says Dr Xand on What's Up Docs.But getting more comfortable with saying no may be the first step to taking more control over our lives.\"Whether you're eight or 80, saying no, and sticking up for what you believe in is actually quite important for your mental health,\" says Dr Xand.Behavioural scientist Dr Sunita Sah suggests three ways to get better at it. Should you say 'no' more often?The doctors explore the psychology behind our reluctance to turn things down, and how we can become more comfortable protecting our boundaries.1. Realise it's okay to say noSaying no can feel uncomfortable. Many of us were brought up to do as we were told, and as adults we struggle to go against how we've been raised.\"We equate compliance with good and defiance with bad,\" says Dr Sah. \"Children get lots of training in compliance, but they need to receive training in defiance too.\"Reshaping how we view and define saying no is key. Seeing it as a positive act instead of a negative one can be instrumental in taking greater control over decisions.\"To defy is to act in accordance with your true values, especially when there is pressure to do otherwise.\"When deciding whether to say yes or no, the question to ask is whether you're going against your values.These are often expressed as single, powerful words like integrity, compassion, or equality. But we may struggle to enact them in daily life.Establishing your values is the first step towards upholding them. \"If we write them down, research shows we are more likely to act in alignment with them,\" says Dr Sah.2. Ask for more time Image source, Getty ImagesIf you don't need to answer immediately, then ask for more time. Dr Sah emphasises the importance of becoming comfortable with asking for a pause.Phrases such as \"Let me think on this\" or \"That's really interesting, let me get back to you\" can be highly effective in buying time to evaluate whether you truly want to undertake the task.\"We know that with any sales pitch, you want to get either some physical distance or some psychological distance between you and the person asking the question.\"We can get that psychological distance from talking to ourselves and asking, 'Do you really want to do this?'\" she says.Creating some physical space between yourself and the person asking the question can also be instrumental in making an informed decision. Dr Sah has previously spoken about how making the decision in private gives us the space to change our mind.3. Practise on your neighbourIf you find it difficult to say no, then practising in low-stake scenarios can help. We make decisions every day, most of them quite small. Things like an invite to your neighbour's house, lending an item or stopping to speak with a salesperson are all perfect opportunities.\"It's not a glamorous act of defiance. It's not standing up to your sexist or racist boss, but it's still necessary to do the less glamorous but still important self-protected bits of defiance,\" says Dr Xand.\"We can lean into those situations where we found it easier to defy and think about what made it easy for me in that situation and use that in other situations,\" adds Dr Sah.When it comes to the important situations – where agreeing would violate something that matters to you – you can then be more confident saying no.Image caption, Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterReutersSir Keir Starmer has said the \"hugely talented\" Angela Rayner will make a return to the cabinet, following her resignation over a tax scandal. The former deputy prime minister quit in September, after it emerged she had failed to pay the correct amount of stamp duty on a £800,000 flat in Hove.An investigation found she had \"acted with integrity,\" but her failure to get the correct tax advice on the purchase fell short of ministerial standards.In an interview with The Observer, the prime minister said she remained a \"major voice in the Labour movement\". Sir Keir added that Rayner, who grew up in poverty and left school at 16, was \"the best social mobility story this country has ever seen\".Asked whether he missed her, he was quoted as saying: \"Yes, of course I do. I was really sad that we lost her.\"Pressed on whether she would be back in the cabinet, he replied: \"Yes. She's hugely talented.\" The reported comments are more categorical than previous remarks he has made about Rayner, who was also deputy Labour leader and housing secretary.At a G20 summit last month, Sir Keir told broadcasters he \"absolutely\" wanted to see her make a return to government \"at some stage\".Rayner has been replaced as deputy Labour leader by Lucy Powell, another former cabinet minister, following an election among party members.  Since her resignation, Rayner has largely kept out of the political limelight. Apart from a statement after her resignation, she has only spoken once in the House of Commons since leaving her government roles.The Ashton-under-Lyne MP, an architect of the government's employment rights bill, had been expected to put forward an amendment to the legislation next week after ministers watered down its new provisions against unfair dismissal.But she agreed to withdraw the proposed change, which would have brought in the new right a year earlier than ministers now plan, following talks with Business Secretary Peter Kyle.Speaking on Sky News, Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden said Rayner was an \"enormous talent\" and he would welcome her return, whilst adding that it remained a \"decision for the prime minister\".

In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.He wrote on X: \"Great to see you [Fumio Kishida]. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe report will look at Covid-era programmes like Eat Out to Help Out, which subsidised hospitality billsCovid-19 support programmes cost taxpayers nearly £11bn through fraud and error, a report will say.The Covid Counter Fraud Commissioner Tom Hayhoe will say fraudsters exploited a \"golden opportunity\" when he shares his findings with MPs this week, the BBC understands.Covid-era policies initiated by the previous Conservative government include the furlough wage subsidies, 'bounce-back' loans, the Eat Out to Help Out programme and one-off grants.They were credited with propping up the economy throughout the Covid lockdowns, however, there has been criticism that the speed of the roll-out of financial support and a lack of eligibility checks led to widespread error and fraud.Mr Hayhoe is expected to reveal the full scale of Covid-19 financial fraud when his final report is shared with MPs on Tuesday.A lack of anti-fraud controls in Covid schemes that were set up quickly by ministers in Boris Johnson's government are expected to be highlighted in the report and blamed for the huge figure. Rushed rollouts meant \"accepting a high level of fraud risk, without plans for managing or mitigating this risk,\" it will say.Details of the report were first published by the Sunday Mirror.In September the government launched a voluntary repayment scheme for people and businesses to return pandemic scheme money with no questions asked until the end of December.Mr Hayhoe has been tasked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves with trying to recover the public money lost to fraud and underperforming contracts using his experience in procurement as the former chair of an NHS trust.His previous reports found that pandemic-era PPE contracts cost the British taxpayer £1.4bn on undelivered contracts and unusable gowns, masks and gloves.Only a small fraction of that - £182m - has been recovered by HM Treasury.The National Crime Agency is separately investigating possible criminal offences committed in the PPE procurement system.",

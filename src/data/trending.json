    "body": "'Living a nightmare': Families of teens missing after ski resort fire desperate for news58 minutes agoAleks PhillipsLaetitia Brodard-Sitre/Facebook16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard is among the missingThe families of teenagers missing after a fire at a bar in a Swiss ski resort are facing an agonising wait for official news and appealing for information about their loved ones online.The blaze ripped through Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, in the Alps in south-west Switzerland, in the early hours of New Year's Day. Verified images show the ceiling catching alight as bottles with sparklers are held aloft.Swiss authorities have said it could take days if not weeks to identify the victims of the fire, which killed 40 people and injured another 119. Officials said on Friday that 113 of the injured had been identified, with authorities still working to identify the other six.In the meantime, families and friends have been taking to social media to appeal for information about their loved ones who were at the bar that night.Follow updates on this storyWhat we know so farWatch as partygoers try to put out flamesThe whereabouts of Swiss national Arthur Brodard, 16, are currently unknown, according to an appeal from his mother, Laetitia.The resident of Lutry, near Lausanne, told local newspaper Le Temps that she had returned to Lausanne to see if he was in the hospital, while Arthur's father did the same in Bern, but could not find him.\"I'm living a nightmare, a nightmare. Either I find my son in the morgue, or I find him in critical condition. It's terrible,\" she said.Laetitia told the newspaper that some of Arthur's friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"The Italian foreign ministry has said six of its citizens remain missing.Among them is Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old junior golfer, originally from Genoa but now living in Dubai.The Italian Golf Federation has said he is dead, without mentioning the fire, paying tribute to a \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father, Edoardo, is quoted by Italian TV channel TG24 as saying his son was at the bar and was last heard from around midnight. An Italian foreign ministry spokesperson has told the BBC that it is not confirming the death yet.Italian Golf FederationJunior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, was last heard from around midnight on New Year's Eve, according to his fatherGiovanni Tamburi, 16, is also among the missing. His mother, Carla Masiello, from Bologna, told La Repubblica that he had been on holiday with his father but had gone out with friends and ended up at La Constellation.\"A close friend of his told me they ran away after the fire broke out and that he had [his phone] with him, but then at a certain point he couldn't see him anymore,\" she told the newspaper, adding he had been wearing a gold chain with a small Madonna around his neck.Tania Causio, one of his teachers at Porta Saragozza High School, told La Repubblica: \"I've always been struck by his kindness and smile, coupled with great maturity. Every time I walk into class, he asks if I want him to go get me a coffee.\"Alice Kallergis, who holds dual Greek and Swiss nationality but lives permanently in Switzerland, was also at the bar on New Year's Eve, according to sources and reports in Greek media.Her brother has posted an appeal on Instagram, saying the family has had \"no news\" regarding the 15-year-old or the three friends she was with and who are also reported missing.Greek consular authorities say they are continuing to monitor the situation closely.Additional reporting by Nikos Papanikolaou",

    "body": "With most of the UK now fully in the grip of Arctic winds, a number of areas awoke to a covering of snow on Friday morning, all the way from Shetland to the south coast of England.The sleet and snow showers that moved southwards across the country on Thursday night created a visual treat for our BBC WeatherWatchers, but also meant slippery roads and pavements for those venturing out.The Met Office issued several weather warnings for snow and ice, with amber warnings for snow in effect from lunchtime on Friday for parts of northern Scotland.The frigid conditions are set to persist into next week, but while further snow showers are possible for some, this weekend will be dry and sunny by day for the vast majority. Nights will become much colder though, with temperatures possibly dropping to minus double digits on Saturday night in a few locations in Scotland and northern England.",

    "body": "A coroner has warned that further babies could die unless the government introduces regulation of non-therapeutic male circumcision following the death of a six-month-old boy in west London.Non-therapeutic circumcision is the removal of the foreskin of male babies and young children for religious or cultural reasons, rather than medical reasons.Mohamed Abdisamad was circumcised on 12 February 2023, by a circumciser who had been recommended to his parents and requested by them to perform the procedure on their son, the West London Coroner's report said.The baby began showing symptoms of illness three to four days later and was taken to hospital on 19 February and died the same day.He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital by ambulance where he went into cardiorespiratory arrest and was pronounced dead at 23:55 GMT.A jury inquest which concluded on 8 October 2025 found the medical cause of death to be an \"invasive streptococcus pyogenes infection following male circumcision\".Assistant coroner Anton van Dellen wrote a prevention of future deaths report in which he called for action over the lack of safety and regulatory measures surrounding non-therapeutic male circumcisions.\"During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern,\" Dr van Dellen wrote in the report dated December 28 2025.\"In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.\"The coroner said there are no national safeguards governing non-therapeutic male circumcision, with no requirements for training, accreditation or registration of those carrying out the procedure, and no rules on record keeping, infection control or aftercare.He also pointed to the lack of a system for obtaining consent prior to the procedure being carried out.The report is being sent to the Department of Health and Social Care, and to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.They have 56 days from the date of the report being issued to respond, the coroner said.Copies of the report are also being sent to Mohamed's mother and father, his maternal grandmother, his uncle, and the London Ambulance Service.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterPAPoliticians have given away too much power to lawyers, activists and regulators, and cannot deliver their promises, an ex-aide to the prime minister has said.Writing in The Times, Paul Ovenden, who quit as Keir Starmer's director of political strategy last September after offensive messages he had sent in 2017 surfaced, said  the British state had got \"bigger and bigger while simultaneously and systematically emasculating itself\".He also said the case of the British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah \"revealed the sheer weirdness of how Whitehall spends its time\". Speaking to the BBC, he said with a \"stiffening resolve\" politicians could \"take back control\" of the levers of democracy. Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme, that he believed Sir Keir was \"exactly the right person\" to make changes adding: \"He does feel those frustrations very acutely.\"Separately, Chris Powell – who worked on four Labour general elections and the brother of the PM's adviser Jonathan Powell – has said the Labour government needs a \"fundamental reset\" in order to fight off the electoral threat posed by Reform UK.Writing in The Guardian, he said voters were \"fed up, think nothing works – and some are simply angry and feel ignored\".Their comments come at the start of a potentially difficult year for the prime minister which includes local elections in May and the threat of a leadership challenge from those in the Labour Party unhappy with his performance so far.Mr Abd El Fattah was imprisoned in an Egyptian jail for more than a decade after being convicted of \"spreading fake news\" about torture in the country. He was released in September following lobbying by successive British governments and arrived in the UK last week. His arrival was initially welcomed by the prime minister who said he was \"delighted\" and that his case had been \"a top priority for my government\".However, Sir Keir faced criticism when social media posts emerged in which Mr Abd El Fattah called for the killing of Zionists and police officers.Sir Keir said he had been unaware of the \"absolutely abhorrent\" posts, which Mr Abd El Fattah has since apologised for, and that the government was reviewing the \"information failures in this case\". Reflecting on the case, Mr Ovenden told Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'd be having long meetings on the priorities of the government and they would be railroaded by any other business into discussions about this gentleman.\"Most of us on the political side of government weren't that aware of it, weren't that tuned into it because it didn't impact us on a day-to-day basis.\"It actually became a kind of running joke within government that people would always find a way to bring it back to this conversation.\"He said the case \"became sort of totemic of the distraction of issues that it felt like a different part of government were fascinated by\". Asked why politicians could not ignore these subjects, Mr Ovenden said they had \"effectively handed away power\".\"What they're really trying to do is hand away risk but they've handed away power to arm's length bodies, to quangos, to activists, to lawyers, to regulatory framework, to well-networked organisations... who are able to basically stop the machinery of government doing things.\"He said examples of subjects he considered to be distractions included paying colonial reparations or banning vaping in pub gardens.He added that it was \"no surprise the public are fed up with politicians' ability to get things done\" but that he believed that \"we can change this and change quite quickly\". He argued that the government should start by scaling back some of the government's legal obligations such as environmental obligations for building and the right to launch legal challenges against government policies through judicial reviews. His comments echoed a sentiment previously expressed by others in government, including the prime minister. Before Christmas, when asked by the parliamentary Liaison Committee what he had found most difficult in government, Sir Keir replied: \"Speed and ability to get things done in Parliament.\"We have so many checks and balances and consultations and regulations and arm's length bodies.\"My own sense, after 12 to 18 months in the job - and this is a fault of governments of all political colours - is that every time something has gone wrong in the past, successive governments have put in place another procedure, another body or another consultation to try to stop ourselves ever making a mistake again. \"My experience as prime minister is of frustration that every time I go to pull a lever, there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations and arm's length bodies that mean the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be, which is among the reasons I want to cut down on regulation generally and within government.\"",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has named spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as his new chief of staff, just over a month after his previous top aide resigned amid a corruption row.\"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues,\" Zelensky said in a post on social media, publishing a photo of his meeting with Budanov in Kyiv.Budanov, 39, has until now led the Hur military intelligence, which has claimed a number of highly-effective strikes against Russia.His predecessor, Andriy Yermak, wielded enormous political influence throughout Russia's full-scale invasion launched in 2022. He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.In Friday's post on social media, Zelensky wrote: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. \"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November,  and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sapo did not explain why they searched his property. In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterElon Musk's social media platform X has provoked outrage after people used its AI chatbot Grok to alter photos of women by removing their clothing.The BBC has seen several examples of it undressing women to make them appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.XAI, the company behind Grok, did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment, other than with an automatically-generated reply stating \"legacy media lies\".A Home Office spokesperson said it was legislating to ban nudification tools, and under a new criminal offence, anyone who supplied such tech would \"face a prison sentence and substantial fines\".The regulator Ofcom said tech firms must \"assess the risk\" of people in the UK viewing illegal content on their platforms, but did not confirm whether it was currently investigating X or Grok in relation to AI images.Grok is a free AI assistant - with some paid for premium features - which responds to X users' prompts when they tag it in a post.It is often used to give reaction or more context to other posters' remarks, but people on X are also able to edit an uploaded image through its AI image editing feature.It has been criticised for allowing users to generate photos and videos with nudity and sexualised content, and it was previously accused of making a sexually explicit clip of Taylor Swift.Clare McGlynn, a law professor at Durham University, said X or Grok \"could prevent these forms of abuse if they wanted to\", adding they \"appear to enjoy impunity\".\"The platform has been allowing the creation and distribution of these images for months without taking any action and we have yet to see any challenge by regulators,\" she said.XAI's own acceptable use policy prohibits \"depicting likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner\".In a statement to the BBC, Ofcom said it was illegal to \"create or share non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material\" and confirmed this included sexual deepfakes created with AI.It said platforms such as X were required to take \"appropriate steps\" to \"reduce the risk\" of UK users encountering illegal content on their platforms, and take it down quickly when they become aware of it.",

    "body": "Italian pasta is set to be spared from high-level US tariffs that the Trump administration had threatened against 13 producers. The move could have resulted in American importers being taxed at a rate greater than the value of the actual pasta itself, and prices rising sharply for US consumers.But on Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry said the proposed rate had now been drastically cut back.In a statement of its own, the US said the 13 firms had addressed many of its concerns. It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.Tariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product. Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened. The president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing. But economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.In the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.The commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers. Given that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value. It sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.The plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.On Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".In the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added. Others will face slightly higher rates, up to 13.98%.In a statement of their own, which was given to the BBC's US partner CBS News, a US commerce department spokesperson said: \"[Our] post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination. \"Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination.\"Other Trump tariffs that have recently been softened include a planned increase in the tax charged on imports of furniture items - which was postponed for 12 months shortly before it was due to take effect on New Year's Day.And in November, the president signed an order that allowed certain key food products - including coffee, bananas and beef - to escape his tariffs.",

    "body": "Double record-breaking year for UK as 2025 confirmed as warmest and sunniest on recordImage source, GettyBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterThe Met Office has confirmed 2025 as the warmest and sunniest on record in the United Kingdom.Provisional calculations show that with an average temperature of 10.09C, this exceeds the previous record of 10.03C set in 2022.It means that 2025 joins 2022 and 2023 in the top 3 warmest years and it's only the second year where the mean annual temperature has exceeded 10C.The last twelve months were also the sunniest on record with 1648.5 hours recorded, 61.4 hours more than the previous record set in 2003.2025 will also be remembered for having one of the most notable windstorms - Storm Éowyn this century.Here are the biggest weather moments of the year.Hottest summer on recordSummer was notable for its four separate heatwaves and officially the hottest on record overall in the UK.It started with an early June heatwave which brought maximum temperatures above 33C.The mercury then climbed again later in the month with Wimbledon seeing its hottest start to the tournament on record.A brief cooler spell in early July was followed by a third heatwave which brought Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales their hottest weather of the year.A fourth heatwave in August brought temperatures of 33.4C (92.1F) in parts of England, while 31.6C (88.9F) at Charterhall in the Borders, was Scotland's highest August temperature since 2003.The warmth was often accompanied by blue skies with sunshine amounts above average across most of the UK.With hosepipe bans in place there was a close eye on rainfall and drought going through the summer.While overall across the UK, rainfall ended up being 84% of average, it was hugely variable with northern and western areas experiencing wetter than average weather with central, southern and eastern areas well below.Image source, GettyImage caption, Storm Éowyn resulted in widespread damage after red weather warnings were issuedRed warnings for Storm ÉowynStorm Éoywn hit the UK in late January with Northern Ireland and central Scotland experiencing the most severe conditions with wind gusts widely between 80 and 90mph.The Met Office issued rare red warnings - the highest level of warning - for the Central Belt of Scotland and the whole of Northern Ireland with an amber warning across northern parts of the UK.While there is no single measure for severity of storm in the UK, Storm Éoywn was notable as being the most powerful windstorm in a decade.And in terms of most widespread wind gusts above 80mph, it ranked as the most notable in the 21st Century, according to the Met Office.There was widespread transport disruption across Northern Ireland and Scotland with millions of people told to stay at home.One man died when a tree fell on his car in County Donegal.Storm Éoywn was the fifth named storm of the season and the biggest winter storm experienced in the UK until Storm Floris hit in early August.Image source, GettyImage caption, Reservoir levels across parts England fell to levels well below average after the one of the driest spring's on recordDroughtFor much of spring - March, April and May - it was warmer than average.All four UK nations recorded their warmest spring for mean temperature since it first began to be recorded in 1884, surpassing the previous record in 2024. And overall across the UK, it was the warmest spring on record.It was also notable for how dry the weather was, starting with the driest March since 1960 for England and Wales.The dry, sunny and warm weather continued with April seeing the UK register a record number of hours of sunshine, and by mid-May the country was experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years.Spring was on track for being the driest on record - before thunderstorms and rain and the end of May brought the first measurable rain for some parts of the UK in weeks.It ended up being the driest spring since 1974 - and the sixth driest on record for the UK as a whole - with the country receiving only just over half the expected rainfall.Ahead of the summer there was some concern about the level of some our major reservoirs and talk about impending hosepipe bans with the National Drought Group at the time suggesting there was a 'medium risk' of official drought in the summer without sustained rainfall.By July water restrictions and hosepipe bans were introduced for customers of Yorkshire Water, South East, Thames and Southern Water. November extremesImage source, PAImage caption, Heavy snow fell in the North York Moors where there was an amber Met Office warningIn early November the weather was particularly mild with above average temperatures, especially overnight.On Bonfire Night, traditionally a time to wrap up warm to watch fireworks, temperatures were higher than normal with a number of weather stations setting new November minimum temperature records for warmth.And in Chivenor, Devon with a minimum temperature of 14.8C recorded on 5 November, it was the warmest Bonfire Night on record.Soon after, an Arctic wind spread across the UK with temperatures falling quickly with significant snowfalls for some parts.With -12.4 C recorded in Kinbrace, Highland on 11 November, it was the coldest November night in almost 15 years.The cold northerly winds also resulted in frequent snow showers across northern and eastern Scotland and north east England where up to 25cm of accumulated snow gave some disruption.A \"Pembrokeshire Dangler\" - a stream of showers, wintry in this case - also gave significant snowfalls in south west Wales and Cornwall.Colder weather in autumn hasn't been that unusual in our past climate but in an increasingly warmer climate, snow and ice in early November is and will become more unusual.",

It set a new all-time record reaching 10,046 points before falling back below the 10,000 mark.  Despite much talk of high stock valuations in the US over the past year, the London index outperformed the major American indexes in 2025.Shares in British brands such as Currys and Next rose steeply alongside gains for precious metal miners, defence and financial services companies.The FTSE 100 tracks the performance of the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. A big rise is good news for investors, including anyone with a pension or other savings that are invested in the stock market, but is not a direct measure of the UK economy's performance.Many of the constituent companies have large overseas operations as well as a UK presence, and around three quarters of the revenues of the FTSE 100 firms is generated abroad. In 2025 rising gold and silver prices boosted firms such as Rio Tinto, while increased global defence spending lifted contractors including Babcock and Rolls-Royce -  amid economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. The British benchmark index set a new all-time intraday record as trading resumed after the new year holiday, rising more than 1% within the first hour to reach 10,046 points - up 115 from its previous level, before falling back below the threshold. Shortly after midday on Friday, it had dropped to 9,981.21 points.Susannah Streeter, an independent financial commentator, said the 10,000-point marker was \"a psychologically important milestone\" and showed London's blue-chip index was \"back in favour\" with investors.\"Concerns continue to swirl about the super-high valuation of US tech sector,\" she said, making the UK market more appealing.Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investment platform AJ Bell, said crossing the 10,000-point was a New Year's gift for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who has been calling for more  investment in the UK share market to boost economic growth.\"She has been banging the drum about the merits of investing over parking cash in the bank.\"The FTSE 100's achievements just go to show what's possible when buying UK shares,\" he said.While London-quoted companies were sometimes considered \"old and boring\", the mix of industries, including mining and banking, appealed to investors seeking stability during uncertain times, he said.\"Investors often seek solace in companies whose goods and services should be in demand no matter what's happening in the world. \"For example, we all need to pay insurance or water bills, or those in the habit are still likely to buy cigarettes or vapes, and the FTSE 100 has plenty of companies playing on these themes on offer.\"The chancellor said the FTSE's break-through was \"a vote of confidence in Britain's economy and a strong start to 2026\".The FTSE index, which is dominated by large international companies, closed 2025 at 9,931, after repeatedly hitting record highs during the year. Although it is often seen as a measure of Britain's corporate strength, the FTSE 100 largely reflects global business activity because most of its companies earn a significant share of their revenues overseas rather than from the UK economy.Its rise follows a global trend, which has seen stock markets surge over the expectation that artificial intelligence (AI) will boost company earnings.However, some experts have warned that if high hopes for AI are not realised, or do not appear quickly enough, that enthusiasm could evaporate – and prompt a steep fall in share values.Share prices rise or fall based on investors' expectations of what they think companies will earn in the future. Among the strong performers in 2025 were fashion retailer Next, which raised its profit outlook four times over the year, and luxury brand Burberry which returned to profit after back-to-back annual losses.However, shares in bakery chain Greggs have seen a 39% drop with investors anxious about its expansion plans and lacklustre sales growth. Diageo and WH Smith also suffered sharp falls.",

    "body": "The 2025 Formula 1 season is heading for a hectic climax with three races on successive weekends to decide the winner of the drivers' championship. Lando Norris has a commanding 24-point lead over McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri heading into the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which takes place under the lights on the Strip at 04:00 GMT on Sunday. That is followed by grands prix in Qatar, from 28-30 November, and then Abu Dhabi, from 5-7 December.  Before the race in Vegas, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.Are Ferrari chair John Elkann's comments that Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc need to concentrate \"on driving and talk less\" after their poor results this season unfair? - JordanJohn Elkann certainly caused a stir with his remarks the day after the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.It's not clear what exactly provoked them, as Ferrari did not say.But given they came less than 24 hours after Hamilton had said that his run of results in his first season at Ferrari were \"a nightmare, and I have been living it for a while\", it would not be unreasonable to suppose the seven-time champion might have been in Elkann's mind.As far as Hamilton goes, this is typical of the sort of emotional remark he makes when he has had a disappointing race.Remember when he said after Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying that he was \"just useless\" and \"drove terribly\" and Ferrari \"probably need to change driver\"?He didn't mean that then, not really. And Brazil should be seen in that context. After all, Hamilton went on to say: \"I believe there is something extraordinary up ahead in my life and in my destiny. I truly still believe in this team and what we can achieve together.\"Which is, one might think, exactly the sort of message Elkann would want to hear.The issue many people had with Elkann's comments was that their accuracy was questionable.He singled out the mechanics for praise for \"basically winning the championship with their performance and everything that has been done on the pit stops\", on the basis they are leading the rankings for average pit-stop time., external Fair enough, but then he said: \"If we look at our engineers, there's no doubt that the car has improved.\"Well, perhaps it has. But not relative to the opposition. Ferrari were 0.372 seconds off the pace on average in qualifying in the first half of the season, and so far in the second they are 0.472secs off.As for the drivers, yes, Hamilton has been through the mill this year, but his performances have improved over the season, even if Brazil was a difficult race for him.But Leclerc has been outstanding. And while he has pointed out regularly that the car is not quick enough, no-one would disagree with that, not even Elkann.Ferrari are in F1 to win. Nothing less is good enough. That's just a fact. And Leclerc has been steadfastly loyal to the team.Ferrari are briefing that Elkann's remarks should be seen as a spur for the team to do better. But it's hard to see how Leclerc and Hamilton would take especially kindly to them, however well meaning they were.The grid seems to be as close in performance as I have ever seen. Has F1 succeeded in creating a situation where each driver's performance over a weekend is a bigger differentiator than in the past, and does the upcoming regulation change threaten this balance? - MattIt stands to reason that if the cars are closer in performance, then the driver would make more of a difference.Whether that is more a factor now than at any other time is a difficult question to answer because there are a lot of aspects of F1 now that work in some ways to reduce the difference between drivers.Telemetry, for example, allows drivers who are not as naturally able to find the limit a chance to catch up over a weekend.You could see this, for example, at Alpine when Fernando Alonso partnered Esteban Ocon.At the start of a weekend, Alonso would typically be considerably quicker than Ocon, who would inch closer with each session until he was competitive in qualifying and sometimes able to beat him.Something else to factor in is that many would argue that the depth of talent at the top of F1 right now is as good as it has ever been, if not better.In Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Alonso, there are three drivers who would be on anyone's list of all-time greats.In addition, Lando Norris, Oscar Piastri, George Russell and Leclerc are all exceptional, without question.That's at least seven world-class drivers in F1 at the same time.Any major regulation change inevitably increases both the gaps between teams, and the risk that one team will steal a march on the rest of the field, as happened in 2022 with Red Bull and 2014 with Mercedes.It would be no surprise if this happened again in 2026. At the same time, there are a lot of very high calibre teams in F1 now, so it should not take too long for the grid to close up again.As the season nears the end, the rookies are increasingly showing their talent. Is there an argument to allow more testing in current cars for new drivers than the current regulations offer? Oliver Bearman, Kimi Antonelli and Isack Hadjar really look settled and in a good place. - ChrisWell, you could argue that there is no need to change the testing regulations as Antonelli, Bearman and Hadjar have all proved their talent without the need for it!There is no appetite in F1 to increase testing allowances. Testing is expensive.Having said that, there is an acceptance that rookie drivers could do with more opportunities to experience F1.That's why the rules were changed this year to force teams to run rookies in two sessions per car - a total of four for the season.And it's why teams have started running young drivers in cars from previous years - so called testing of previous cars (TPC) and testing of historic cars (THC).Antonelli, for example, did an extensive TPC programme last year, and this is becoming increasingly common as a way of preparing rookies for F1 debuts.Are Aston Martin the team to watch next season with Adrian Newey in charge of the design of next year's car? - IanThe truth is no-one knows what the competitive order will be next year, and no-one will know until the first race of the season.Newey has a strong record when it comes to regulation changes. He aced the ones in 1998 with McLaren, 2009 with Red Bull (once the controversial advantage of Brawn's double diffuser had been neutralised), and in 2022 with Red Bull again.In 1998, he had officially joined McLaren only in September of the previous year. With Aston Martin, he has had six more months than that, albeit F1 is a lot more complex now.Of course, the whole of F1 is waiting with interest to see how Newey gets on with Aston Martin.  On the engine side, Honda, which will become sole factory partner to Aston Martin, clearly knows what it's doing.Aston Martin's lead driver is pretty handy, as well.But success in F1 tends to come from stability. And stable is the last thing Aston Martin have been in recent years.There have been a dizzying number staff changes at senior levels, and they are continuing to this day.A new leadership structure has to bed down. Andy Cowell has only been chief executive officer for a little over a year, and Newey did not join until March this year. Enrico Cardile was signed from Ferrari in July 2024, but took on his role as chief technical officer only in August.In many ways, in those circumstances, it would be a miracle if Aston Martin were competitive next year. But, well, Newey…",

    "body": "9 minutes agoGetty ImagesMPs and members of the House of Lords have been warned by MI5 that they face a significant risk of espionage from the Chinese state.Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, have circulated a new \"espionage alert\" issued by the security services.Writing to MPs, Sir Lindsay said Chinese state actors were \"relentless\" in trying to \"interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament\".He said the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) was \"actively reaching out to individuals in our community\", and that they wanted to \"collect information and lay the groundwork for long-term relationships, using professional networking sites, recruitment agents and consultants acting on their behalf\".The alert from MI5 says \"false personas\" approach targets to \"work as freelance consultants authoring geopolitical reports\".It specifically identifies two LinkedIn profiles which it says are used on behalf of the MSS.The alert says they act as \"civilian recruitment head-hunters\", recruiting individuals working in British politics for the MSS, and solicit \"non-public and insider insights\".Other elements of espionage described in the MI5 alert include all-expenses paid trips to China, and payment for information through cash or cryptocurrency.Targets are said to include \"Parliament staff, economists, think tank employees, geo-political consultants and those working alongside [the government] including MPs and members of the House of Lords\".Security Minister Dan Jarvis will address the House of Commons later on measures the government is taking to combat Chinese espionage.",

Has Donald Trump changed his mind on the Epstein Files?AmericastAvailable for over a yearOn Sunday night Donald Trump told Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote in favour of releasing files relating to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein “because we have nothing to hide”. It’s a striking change in position from the president who has so far resisted pressure from Democrats and Republicans in his own party who have been demanding that all files relating to Epstein be released into the public domain. \nOne of the Republicans calling for their release is the conservative firebrand and Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once one of Trump’s most faithful supporters. After stepping up her demands to see the files released, she now appears to have lost the president’s backing who called her a “traitor” and a “disgrace” to the Republican Party. We answer your questions on why the pair have fallen out.\nAnd, we answer your questions on why there’s been another presidential pardon, this time for the UK billionaire Joe Lewis, whose family trust owns Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

    "body": "Dan Wootton denies High Court claim that he catfished 'former colleague'12 hours agoLizo MzimbaEntertainment correspondentGetty ImagesDan Wootton denies the allegations made against himBroadcaster and journalist Dan Wootton has responded to a court claim against him, denying that he catfished a man who says he was a former colleague.Earlier this year, the man filed a case claiming that in 2009 he was tricked by Wootton into sending him explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.He says Wootton did this by sending him sexualised messages, pretending to be a woman called Maria Joseph.In documents filed at the High Court, Wootton denies ever communicating \"via any medium\" with the man, who has been granted anonymity by the court.Wootton also denies that he \"ever has been in possession\" of any \"explicit photographs or video\" portraying the man.Explicit photos and videoThe anonymous claimant has previously told the court that in 2009 Wootton communicated with him via email, SMS and Facebook. The man says that at the time he believed he was communicating with a woman called Maria Joseph, and did not know that he was, in fact, communicating with Wootton, according to the claim.The man says that the messages soon became \"sexualised and flirtatious\", and that Wootton sent him photographs of a female which, he claims, Wootton falsely pretended were of the woman the claimant thought he had been communicating with.He says that some of the photographs showed the female partially or fully naked.The man also said Wootton sent him a video of a man and a woman having sex, again pretending that the female in the video was the woman whom the anonymous claimant thought he was communicating with.Wootton denies the claimsIn documents filed recently at the High Court, Wootton said it was denied that he \"communicated with the claimant via any medium - including email, SMS or Facebook; and denied that he sent the claimant any images or videos\".The anonymous man also previously said in his claim that believing that he was communicating with a woman, he responded to the messages in a flirtatious and sexualised manner.He said Wootton (pretending to be Maria Joseph) encouraged him to send explicit photographs of himself. The man added that \"in the induced belief that he was communicating with Maria Joseph, an unknown female who was interested in a sexual relationship\", and who had already sent explicit images of herself, he was \"persuaded to and did send\" explicit photographs of himself as well as an explicit video.Wootton says in court documents it is denied that he \"was or ever has been in possession of any flirtatious or sexualised messages from the claimant, or explicit photographs or video portraying the claimant\".He also said in the documents that the anonymous claimant did not believe that the recipient of his messages was called Maria Joseph. Wootton added that the claimant stated to Maria Joseph: \"Maria (if that is really your name)... we are in a catch 22. i can't play without finding this out. won't tell them as i'm not gonna advertise the fact i have apparently started to chatting to hot strangers on the internet. or tell me your real name then? [sic]\".Pain, injury and humiliationThe anonymous claimant is suing Wootton, saying that he has suffered pain, injury, humiliation and hurt to his feelings. And that he has sustained loss and damage because of Wootton's actions.He says that he has suffered from major depressive order and use of alcohol.Wootton has said that he does not accept that the anonymous claimant has suffered \"any injury as a result of any communication of messages, images, and/or videos between him and 'Maria Joseph'.\"He has denied that he and the man were former colleagues, and said the man's claim should not be allowed, because any case should have been brought years before.",

    "body": "12 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterCustomers with bank accounts in the UK will see a significant increase in the amount of money that is protected if their bank or building society collapses.The deposit protection scheme means customers can currently claim back the first £85,000 of their money. But from December that will rise to £120,000.The move, confirmed by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) which supervises UK banks, marks the biggest increase since 2017 when the current limit was set.Martyn Beauchamp, chief executive of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), said: \"This rise ensures that consumers can feel confident their money is safe, from the very first penny up to £120,000.\"The new deposit protection limit increase is higher than the PRA's earlier proposal of £110,000 and reflects both the latest inflation data and feedback from consultations, the Bank of England said.The FSCS protection applies per person, per authorised firm. Some banking groups operate multiple brands under a single licence, meaning the limit covers the total amount held across those brands. Customers do not need to take any action as the new limit will apply automatically.Sam Woods, deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England and chief executive of the PRA, said: \"This change will help maintain the public's confidence in the safety of their money. \"It means that depositors will be protected up to £120,000 should their bank, building society or credit union fail. Public confidence supports the strength of our financial system.\"Consumer group Which? described the move as \"a sensible decision\" that supports consumer confidence in the financial services industry.Rocio Concha, Which? Director of policy and advocacy, said: \"It is also a timely reminder that, at a time when the government and regulators are trying to boost economic growth, strong consumer protections needn't hamper those aims.\"Eric Leenders, managing director of personal finance at UK Finance which represents the banking industry, said it was was \"right\" to update the limit to take account of inflation and would help to implement the changes.Alongside the new deposit limit, the cap for temporary high balances - to cover life events such as funds from a house sale or insurance payout - will also rise from £1m to £1.4m for six months. The FSCS is funded by a levy on financial firms authorised by the PRA or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).",

    "body": "6 minutes agoRobert Cuffe & Matt MurphyBBC VerifyNet migration to the UK last year was 20% lower than previously thought, according to revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).The number, the difference between those entering and leaving the country, has been revised down by 86,000 people and now stands at 345,000 arriving in 2024.The driving factor behind the change is that more British nationals are thought to have emigrated in 2024 than initially recorded, with 100,000 fewer now thought to be living in the UK.Migration peaked higher than previously thought, according to the figures, adding 944,000 to the UK population between April 2022 and March 2023. Previous estimates put the number at 906,000 by June 2023.The new figures make little change to the overall estimate of net migration to the UK between 2021 and 2024, falling slightly from 2.6 million people to 2.5 million in the revised report.It comes after the government announced new proposals aimed at reforming the asylum system, which include periodic reviews of asylum status and limitations of migrants' rights to claim benefits.The ONS have been rebuilding the system used to produce official estimates of migration since 2020. Before the pandemic, statisticians asked a small number of passengers at airports and ports about their travel plans and used those responses to work out how many arrivals might be coming to stay.But the results obtained by this method were \"implausibly low\" for British nationals, according to Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory think tank.Officials at the ONS said the new figures are based on how often people appear in tax and benefits records, providing a more accurate and active reflection of migrants activities in the UK.Based on that method, the ONS now thinks that 257,000 British nationals left the UK in 2024 while 143,000 Britons living abroad returned. That means net emigration of Britons - the difference between departures and arrivals - is 114,000 people, rather than its initial estimate of 17,000.Dr Sumption warns that these figures are \"still not final\" because they don't measure when someone enters or leaves the country. That can cause problems if someone stays in the country but disappears from tax and welfare data because they're living on savings.Using that method such a person would be counted as an emigrant, skewing migration figures. The ONS has stopped using this method to measure EU migration, instead using visas and border data shared by the Home Office.Data obtained under the old system estimated that there were 96,000 fewer EU citizens in the UK by the end of 2024, but the new system has revised that estimate downwards to 69,000.Critics have largely attributed the recent increase to changes brought in under Boris Johnson's government from 2021.The three main factors have been identified as an increase in work visas - particularly in health and social care - an increase in student visas, and the opening of humanitarian routes for people from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan.Small boat crossings have also been rising in that time. So far this year, 39,075 people have crossed the Channel.Both Conservative and Labour governments have sought to tackle the rising migration figures. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced restrictions on the rights of students to bring their families to the UK.On Monday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced sweeping changes to the asylum system, which she said was \"out of control and unfair\".Speaking in the House of Commons, Mahmood said: \"If we fail to deal with this crisis, we will draw more people down a path that starts with anger and ends in hatred.\"",

    "body": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr tells Woman's Hour that this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or \"Just quickly look something up\" without thinking.What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: \"I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.\"By naming it - \"I need to check my train times\" or \"I'm replying to my mum\" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.\"It stops the other person feeling ignored,\" Dr Regehr says.\"And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.\"Doing this could help improve your relationships too.Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, led a study which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.\"Not everyone reacts in the same way,\" Dr Hart says. \"It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.\"They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.\"Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before.",

    "body": "10 hours agoNada Tawfik,North America correspondent, and Dearbail JordanThe UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute. The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.  Adopting it was an \"important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire\", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands. The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan \"imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject\".\"Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,\" it added.Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be \"tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians\".The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution. Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.Trump called the Security Council vote \"historic\" and said it was a way of \"acknowledging and endorsing\" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board. \"This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to \"translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground\" and lead to \"a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution\". The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented \"urgently and immediately\".Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a \"fragile, fragile first step\".Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

Well, voles are feeding my barn owls so if you reduce the vole population you are having an effect on the barn owls,\" he explained.He added that there needed to be wider consultation with farmers and landowners about the best areas to reintroduce the wildcats.European wildcats – historically also known as woodcats – were once widespread in Great Britain until human persecution and the loss of woodland and rough grass habitats saw them disappear from England and Wales.Today, the UK's only remaining wildcat population lives in the Highlands of Scotland but, despite being given protected status in 1988, they are now classed as critically endangered and at risk of UK extinction, with as few as 115 remaining in the wild.Malcolm Prior/BBCCath Jeffs, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said measures taken to stop other predators from targeting farmed birds would work for wildcats.Cath Jeffs, the South West Wildcat Project lead for Devon Wildlife Trust, said the team would continue to work closely with locals to deal with any concerns or issues raised over the phased reintroduction and that specific locations had yet to be decided.She pointed out that most measures taken to stop predators like foxes from targeting poultry or gamebirds would work for wildcats.She added that it was unlikely there would be a population explosion as wildcats live in low density numbers over wider areas and they would be closely monitored and managed. \"We are absolutely committed to making this happen, but in the right way and at the right time,\" she added.The south west of England has been identified as a prime site for reintroduction because of the woodland cover it offers across mid-Devon, connected by other habitats that suit wildcats.But some critics have suggested the area is more populated than parts of the Highlands where they have been reintroduced before.They said that could lead to the wildcats breeding with feral domestic cats, with such interbreeding – also known as hybridisation - undermining the whole idea of bringing back the species.Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the organisation was not opposed to \"properly planned and managed reintroduction\".But he said there were concerns about the ability to sustain a \"genetically pure\" population of wildcat because of the threat of hybridisation.\"Reintroducing wildcats in the south-west without addressing this issue would seem to be doomed to failure,\" he said.A spokeswoman for the Devon Wildlife Trust said they would tackle the threat of hybridisation by working with local welfare organisations to support a neutering programme for feral and domestic cats in areas where wildcats were introduced.",

    "body": "What now for Queen's playhouse after Andrew evicted from Royal Lodge?6 hours agoIolo CheungBBC WalesWelsh playhouse amuses generations of royalsOnce described as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.The miniature two-storey thatched cottage was gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932 by the people of Wales.It was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.But with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?Getty ImagesA young Princess Elizabeth outside Y Bwthyn Bach in June 1933Y Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.It was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.It even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.\"It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,\" said historian Dr Elin Jones.Museum WalesThe cottage was assembled in Wales before being transported in its entirety to Royal Lodge in Windsor\"It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,\" said Dr Jones.At the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.Custody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.Princess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the \"most glamorous Wendy house ever\" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.\"Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,\" she said at the time. \"We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.\"Princess Beatrice showed Andrew Marr around Y Bwthyn Bach for a BBC seriesBut with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.\"Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,\" said Dr Jones.\"But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.\"The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.\"But those ties are \"weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society\", the historian said.Getty ImagesKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Princesses Margaret and The Queen Mother at Y Bwthyn Bach in 1936Dr Jones added: \"I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.\"Royal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.\"It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?\" she said.\"What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it. It's only going to be forgotten about, dilapidated, unless Prince William lets his kids play there.\"If that were not the case, she too would like to see it return to Wales.\"It was a gift so it belongs to them,\" she said. \"I'm not sure really if you can ask for a gift back.\"But, historically, I'd love to see it, the public have never seen the inside.\"I would suggest bring it back to St Fagans museum and we can all have a look at it, even if you need to demolish it brick by brick and put it back together.\"More top stories",

    "body": "2 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Patrick Clahane and Rebecca WearnA paralegal who was secretly filmed telling a BBC undercover reporter how he can help businesses avoid fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, has been sacked.At a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, Zohaib Hussain said he could \"make documents\" including \"business agreements\" for a fee of £3,500 to help dodge immigration fines.His employer, RKS Solicitors, confirmed he had been \"permanently dismissed\" a day after the investigation was broadcast and a \"police report\" had been made.Mr Hussain previously said he categorically denied \"all allegations, insinuations, and claims\".The Home Office announced an \"urgent investigation\" involving the National Crime Agency and multiple police forces following a series of BBC reports into organised criminal networks operating on High Streets the length of Britain.They exposed how a Kurdish crime network is enabling migrants to work illegally in mini-marts across the UK.Our investigation also uncovered a man at the centre of an immigration crime group who said he had \"customers in every city\" and could enable illegal working.Following the reports, senior politicians warned that the crime networks were  acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.Questioned by the BBC on whether the government has lost control of High Streets to Kurdish organised crime gangs, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"What your reporters were able to scrutinise and show is absolutely evidence of why our system is broken.\"It's why this government has been cracking down on illegal working.\"In one of the investigations, an undercover reporter posed as a mini mart owner who had received a fine from immigration enforcement worth up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers, and met with Zohaib Hussain.During the meeting at a solicitor's in Huddersfield, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story.\"How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?\"Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: \"Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?\"Mr Hussain went on to explain how to avoid the fine.  He said: \"Sometimes we might have to make documents,\" said Mr Hussain, such as \"business agreements\".Our undercover reporter then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be \"the last resort.\"Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.He said his charges would be £3,500 and he \"would look after us\".During the whole meeting with Mr Hussain, a man known as Shaxawan was present in the room.Shaxawan was revealed by the BBC as a man at the centre of an organised crime network involved in the facilitation of illegal working.He told undercover journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and \"confuse\" immigration enforcement.In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England, including many High Street mini marts.Mr Hussain asked our undercover reporter to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.In a previous statement to the BBC, Mr Hussain said: \"For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.\"He added: \"I have never been involved in, nor have I facilitated, encouraged, or condoned, any form of illegal or improper activity.\"Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied \"every allegation, insinuation and claim made\" in our reporting, and said that he was \"not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity\".In a earlier statement, RKS Solicitors said it had informed the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA).\"Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.\"The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the \"highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service\".West Yorkshire Police said it \"is working in close partnership with the Home Office, which has assumed primacy for the investigation into the matters highlighted in recent BBC reporting\".",

It’s also triggered a number of conspiracy theories online about the presidential bunker that sits underneath the East Wing of the White House.\nAnd, Sarah and Marianna speak to White House historian and First Lady specialist Katherine Sibley about the historic significance of the East Wing, what’s being lost in its demolishment, and what Melania Trump might think about losing her office in the complex.\nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Correspondent\nGUEST\n• Katherine Sibley, White House historian\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve, Alix Pickles, Kris Jalowiecki and Rufus Gray.

Police were working to establish the breed of the animal and no arrests had been made.Ch Supt John Davies said: \"Officers are on scene and will be making further inquiries as the investigation progresses.\"Residents said they were in disbelief at the death of the child, with the community in shock and trying to come to terms with what had happened.They said they saw police cars and ambulances on the quiet residential street at the time of the incident.There was a police presence overnight at the semi-detached house and a police car was parked outside. On Monday morning, other than the hum of the commuters travelling on the nearby M4 motorway and the odd train going past on the south Wales mainline, Rogiet was relatively quiet - just the odd dog walker or locals leaving for work.Additional reporting by James McCarthyResidents said they were in disbelief at the death of a child",

    "body": "37 minutes agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterRental payments will be reflected in credit scores, one of the UK's main credit ratings agencies has said. Experian said it was overhauling its scoring system to better reflect \"more of the everyday financial behaviours that matter\" which included things \"like paying rent or reducing overdraft use\". The new system will see the maximum credit score someone can have go from 999 to 1,250, and will also give more guidance on how borrowers can improve their creditworthiness. Credit scores are used as a broad indicator of a borrower's ability to pay back a loan. A low credit score can make it more difficult to take out a mortgage, get a loan, or enter into a hire purchase agreement on a car. Names of Experian's different scoring bands have also been overhauled, with the categories \"poor\" and \"very poor\" eliminated, as well as the use of the colour red.  The bands will now be named Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair and Low. For customers in the low band, instructions are given on how they can increase their score. The new scoring system will begin being rolled out this month, with a view to making it available to all customers by the end of the year, and will be available on the free version of Experian's service. A spokesperson for Experian said tenants would have to opt in for their rent payments to count. \"As with other data we'll soon be including in the updated score, this reflects that more lenders are now factoring in a positive rent history in their decisions,\" they said. \"Great news for renters who are paying on time, every month.!They added that missing rent payments would have an adverse effect on someone's credit score. Other behaviours the new system is taking into account are cutting overdraft use, avoiding credit card advances and making mortgage overpayments. It will also take a more detailed look at regular payments on mobile phone contracts and how often a customer may switch provider.Experian stressed the changes would not affect someone's ability to get credit, while eligibility for mortgages, loans or credit cards remains unchanged.However, the changes mean that borrowers are likely to change the credit bands they are in. The new system means 44% of customers are likely to drop down a score banding after the changes, 42% are likely to move up a banding, while 14% will see their score band remain the same, Experian said.In the UK, there are three credit ratings agencies, the other two being TransUnion and Equifax - neither of whom have changed how they score credit.

    "body": "8 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News Getty ImagesWe all think we know how to brush our teeth - a scrub morning and night, a rinse with water and maybe a minty mouthwash for good measure.But according to dental experts, even the most diligent brushers might be making a few mistakes that could be undoing their good work.Dr Praveen Sharma, from the school of dentistry at the University of Birmingham, says that half of adults in the UK will have gum disease at some point and an early sign is bleeding gums.\"If your gums are bleeding or swollen it's a sign you need to brush better,\" he says. As well as regular dentist visits, here are four things he and BBC's What's Up Docs podcast hosts Dr Xand and Dr Chris van Tulleken, say many of us are currently getting wrong which if we change could improve the health of our teeth.1. Brushing once well is better than twice quicklyIt's one of the great dental commandments - brushing twice a day - and that's what the NHS recommends.But Dr Sharma says the real key is quality, not quantity.\"If you can find time, then yes, twice a day,\" he says. \"But it's better to do it once a day well rather than twice quickly.\"If you are brushing once a day then he recommends it be in the evening and make sure you also floss.Of course, no one likes flossing, but Dr Sharma says using interdental brushes, particularly rubber ones, can make it easier and less painful. When it comes to the method, each tooth has an outer, biting and inner surface and all three need to be brushed. Dr Sharma advises small circular motions over each surface without applying too much pressure. He also says to pay particular attention to the junction between the tooth and the gum as that's where gum disease can occur.Dr Xand says it's important to \"focus on the sensation of the bristles\" and approach tooth brushing mindfully, not scrolling on your phone at the same time.2. Brush before breakfast, not afterMany people brush their teeth right after eating, but that might not be doing your enamel any favours.\"Ideally, brush before breakfast,\" Dr Sharma says. \"You don't want to do it after something acidic. \"If you do brush after, then you need to leave some space between eating and brushing.\"That's because acids from foods and drinks, especially fruit juice or coffee, can soften tooth enamel and brushing too soon afterwards can wear it away.Dr Chris suggests rinsing your mouth with water after eating to get rid of some acid and then waiting at least 30 minutes if you are brushing after breakfast. 3. Don't rinse after brushingIf you've been spitting, rinsing and gargling after every brush, you might want to rethink that last step.\"You spit but don't rinse,\" Dr Sharma advises. Rinsing your mouth washes away the concentrated fluoride in the remaining toothpaste.That means simply spitting out the excess toothpaste and leaving the thin layer of fluoride behind to continue protecting your teeth.4. Expensive toothpaste isn't betterWith shelves full of whitening, charcoal, and enamel-boosting pastes, it's easy to assume the pricier options will give you a healthier smile. But according to Dr Sharma, it doesn't really matter which brand you choose, as long as it contains one key ingredient.\"As long as your toothpaste has fluoride, it doesn't make much difference,\" he says, adding that he tends to buy whatever is cheaper or on offer. Fluoride helps protect enamel and prevents decay, and that's what really counts.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "7 hours agoMost papers lead on the aftermath of the Saturday night stabbing attack on a train from Doncaster to London. The knifeman told police to \"kill me\" after leaving the train where he stabbed 11 people, the Sun reports. Passengers tell the paper he stabbed \"anyone he could\" in the attack, before being Tasered by police officers.The attacker told a passenger that \"the devil is not going to win\" during the rampage, the Daily Mail reports. A passenger of the train tells the Daily Star that she was spared by the knifeman during the \"bloodbath\". The paper is one of several others to also report that the suspect shouted \"the devil won't win\". \"Terror on the tracks\", is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which also reports on a passenger who was spared by the attacker. He stood over Dayna Arnold, 48, carrying a blade, but carried on after she said: \"Please don't kill me.\"Passengers initially thought the attack was a Halloween prank, leads the Daily Telegraph, which also reports that eyewitnesses said the scene was \"like something from a film\". A 32-year-old British national is in custody on suspicion of attempted murder. The Guardian reports a \"heroic\" rail worker who intervened in the attack to defend passengers is \"fighting for his life\". Witnesses describe to the paper a \"terrifying\" 14 minutes during which \"bloodied stabbing victims\" ran through train carriages.The \"hero\" rail worker \"single-handedly confronted the Huntingdon train knifeman\", writes the Daily Express, which also describes the incident as \"one of the UK's most shocking knife attacks\". The suspected attacker was not known to counterterrorism officers or security services, though police say there is no suggestion the incident was an act of terrorism, according to the Times.Extra police officers will be deployed across the rail network this week - especially at major hubs like London, Birmingham, York, Leeds and Manchester - the i Paper reports. Forensic teams wait on the Huntingdon station platform where the train made an unscheduled emergency stop in the front page photo for the Independent. The train attack features on the front page of the Financial Times, but the paper leads on concerns among city bosses that the minimum wage catching up with graduate starting salaries could negatively impact hiring. The warning comes as the chancellor is expected to announce a 4% increase to the hourly minimum wage in the Budget. \"Risky High St baby scans\" is the lead for the Metro, which reports on \"unsafe\" private ultrasound clinics that have sprung up in shopping centres, town centre shops and industrial estates. In one case, a blood clot was \"wrongly identified as a malformed foetus\", after which the mother was advised to have an induced miscarriage, even though the baby was healthy. Many of the papers describe how the man who stabbed 11 people on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday night told one passenger, \"the Devil's not going to win,\" as she pleaded with him not to kill her. The Daily Mirror says 48-year-old Dayna Arnold was cowering on the floor as she begged for her life. The Daily Telegraph reports that \"something changed\" in the attacker's eyes before he uttered the statement. The Sun says witnesses described him as looking \"possessed\" as he swaggered down the platform, after leaving the train.The Times and the Guardian lead their coverage by praising the heroic rail worker, who is in a fight for his life, after he saved many other passengers. The Telegraph highlights how the quick actions of the driver also saved passengers. The Daily Express says we should remember that \"while such atrocities reveal the very worst of humanity, they are also met by the very best.\" The Daily Mail sums up the attack with the strap-line: \"horror and heroism on the 6.25.\"The Daily Mail says the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will spare working people from the worst of what it calls her \"tax assault\" in the Budget. But it notes that she'll describe \"working people\" as those earning less than £45,000 per year, which, the paper says, will come as a surprise to many teachers, train drivers and tradespeople. The Times warns the Treasury that it cannot rely on tax rises alone to fill its fiscal hole; to shrink away from cuts to the ballooning welfare bill, it suggests, would be a grave error. The Guardian says Reeves is being advised not to cut VAT on electricity bills, as a \"fast and simple\" way to cut cost of living pressures. The paper warns this could result in a giveaway to richer homeowners, while undermining the UK's climate commitments.Many papers continue to ruminate on the position of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, with the Times suggesting that after losing his final military rank of vice-admiral, he might also be stripped of his campaign medal from the Falklands conflict. The Daily Mail suggests he could even lose his car registration plates. He he was often seen driving Range Rovers bearing the initials DOY - a reference to one of his former titles, the Duke of York. \"Another day, another humiliation,\" states the Daily Star.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump says he does not know who Changpeng Zhao is, despite pardoning the cryptocurrency multi-billionaire last month.Trump was asked about the pardon during an interview with CBS News' 60 Minutes programme, which was broadcast on Sunday.Zhao, who is also known as \"CZ\", pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering in 2023. He served four months in prison and agreed to step down as the chief executive of Binance, the crypto exchange he co-founded.His companies have partnered with firms linked to Trump on new digital-currency projects including Dominari Holdings, where his sons sit on the board of advisers and which is based in Trump Tower.The host of 60 Minutes, Norah O'Donnell, asked Trump why he pardoned Zhao even though government prosecutors had said he caused \"significant harm to US national security.\"\"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is,\" the president said.Trump added that he did not recall meeting Zhao and had \"no idea who he is\", only that he had been told that the businessman was a victim of a \"witch hunt\" by the administration of former US President Joe Biden.During the interview, Trump also discussed his support for cryptocurrencies and said that the US had to make sure it was a leader in the industry or risk China and its rivals gaining an advantage in the emerging technology.CBS News is the BBC's US news partner.The president's pardon lifts restrictions that had stopped Zhao from running financial ventures, but it is unclear whether it changes his standing with US regulators or his role at Binance.At the time of the pardon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called Zhao's prosecution under the Biden administration part of a \"war on cryptocurrency\", pushing back on critics who said the pardon appeared motivated by Trump's personal financial interests.\"This was an overly prosecuted case by the Biden administration,\" she said, adding that the case had been \"thoroughly reviewed\". \"So the president wants to correct this overreach of the Biden administration's misjustice and he exercised his constitutional authority to do so.\"The Binance platform remains the most used crypto exchange in the world for trading digital assets.The Trump administration previously halted a fraud case against crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun, after his investments in the Trump family's crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.In May, it was announced that a stablecoin launched by World Liberty Financial would be used by an Abu Dhabi firm for a $2bn (£1.52bn) investment in Binance.Trump has also pardoned founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who faced charges related to money laundering, and Ross Ulbricht, founder of the Silk Road, the dark web marketplace known as a place for drug trade.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAoife Walsh,Washington and George WrightDonald Trump has played down the possibility of a US war with Venezuela, but suggested Nicolás Maduro's days as the country's president are numbered.Asked if the US was going to war against Venezuela, the US president told CBS' 60 Minutes: \"I doubt it. I don't think so. But they've been treating us very badly.\"His comments come as the US continues to launch strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean. The Trump administration says the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US.Trump rejected suggestions that the US action was not about stopping narcotics, but aimed at ousting Maduro, a long-time Trump opponent, saying it was about \"many things\". At least 64 people have been killed by US strikes in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, CBS News - the BBC's US news partner - reported. Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said: \"Every single boat that you see that's shot down kills 25,000 on drugs and destroys families all over our country.\"Pushed on whether the US was planning any strikes on land, Trump refused to rule it out, saying: \"I wouldn't be inclined to say that I would do that... I'm not gonna tell you what I'm gonna do with Venezuela, if I was gonna do it or if I wasn't going to do it.\"Maduro has previously accused Washington of \"fabricating a new war\", while Colombian President Gustavo Petro has said the strikes on boats are being used by the US to \"dominate\" Latin America.Trump said the government was \"not going to allow\" people \"from all over the world\" to come in. \"They come in from the Congo, they come in from all over the world, they're coming, not just from South America. But Venezuela in particular - has been bad. They have gangs,\" he said, singling out Tren de Aragua. He called it \"the most vicious gang anywhere in the world\".President Trump was also asked about nuclear testing, after he called on US military leaders to resume testing nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.Asked by CBS's Norah O'Donnell if he planned for the US to detonate a nuclear weapon for the first time in more than 30 years, Trump said: \"I'm saying that we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"He added: \"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it.\"Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996 respectively.Pressed further on the topic, Trump said: \"They don't go and tell you about it.\"\"I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test,\" he said, adding North Korea and Pakistan to the list of nations allegedly testing their arsenals.Also on Sunday, Trump's energy secretary downplayed the idea that the US was planning to set off a nuclear explosion.Chris Wright said any tests would be \"non-critical explosions\" on \"other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion\".During the interview, Trump also spoke about the US government shutdown, which has gone on for more than a month and left millions of Americans facing the loss of essential services.The president blamed Democrats, calling them \"crazed lunatics\" who have \"lost their way\" - but said he believed they will eventually capitulate and vote to end the shutdown.\"And if they don't vote, that's their problem,\" he said.It was Trump's first interview with CBS since he sued its parent company, Paramount, over a 2024 interview with then Vice-President Kamala Harris.He claimed the interview - which aired as part of the presidential election campaign - had been edited to \"tip the scales in favour of the Democratic Party\".Paramount agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle the suit, but with the money allocated to Trump's future presidential library, not paid to him \"directly or indirectly\". It said the settlement did not include a statement of apology.Trump last appeared on the 60 Minutes programme in 2020, when he walked out of an interview with Lesley Stahl because he claimed the questions were biased. He did not agree to an interview with the show during the 2024 election.",

    "body": "12 hours agoFrank Gardnersecurity correspondent, in BahrainNato \"will stand with Ukraine up to the day in which we will have them sitting around the table for a long-lasting peace\", a senior official from the military alliance has told the BBC.Admiral Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, chair of Nato's military committee since January, added from an operational point of view he considered the Russia-Ukraine war was bogged down, and \"it was almost time to sit and talk because it's a waste of lives\".Pointing to the fact that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 had resulted in two more countries joining the Western alliance - Finland and Sweden - Adm Dragone described the war as a strategic failure for Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite recent slow, incremental advances by Russia on the battlefield. \"They will not get a friendly or puppet government like in Belarus. Putin will not succeed.\"Asked if European nations were prepared to keep going with supporting Ukraine's defence, he said they were. It was beneficial, he believed that they had had something of a wake-up call and were now taking charge of their own defence.In June, Nato members agreed to raise their defence spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. The move followed repeated urges from US President Donald Trump for members to do so.On Russia's recent announcement about long-range, nuclear-powered weapons like the Burevestnik and the Poseidon, the former Italian chief of defence staff and naval aviator played down concerns by Nato, saying that it was a defensive nuclear alliance. \"We are not threatened by them,\" he said, \"we are just ready to defend our 32 nations and our one billion people. We are a nuclear alliance.\"On the risk of future invasions or attacks, Adm Dragone said if - and he emphasised the conditional here - there was to be anywhere it would likely be the Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. But he pointed out that as Nato states Article 5 would be requested - which considers an attack on one nation to be equivalent to an attack on all - and that Nato would come to their defence. Asked if that included the US, he replied: \"Yes, because they have committed to this and they have underlined that they are still in the business.\"Of all Nato defence needs right now, Adm Dragone said air defence was the top priority. Recent incursions by Russian drones into Poland and Romania have prompted the alliance to upgrade its air defences. Regarding the possibility of activating a notional \"drone wall\" on Nato's eastern borders, he said this would be done within months and that \"the alliance's Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk [Virginia] is already working on that\".\"There is a lot of stuff on the market which will fulfil our immediate needs so we set up a new activity which is Eastern Sentry... integrating all the air defence that we already have on our eastern flank. \"Airspace incursions are pretty frequent, we escort them out and that's basically the game,\" the admiral said.Despite no sign that Russia is changing course on the war in Ukraine and despite signs that some members - notably Slovakia and Hungary - are increasingly opposed to supporting Ukraine's defence, Adm Dragone ended on a positive note. \"The alliance is reliable, it is mature, there is a cohesion which is our centre of gravity.\"\"The alliance is stronger than our adversaries, and we will stay with Ukraine up to the day that peace will break out,\" he added.",

    "body": "Private baby scan clinics 'putting expectant mothers at risk'8 hours agoJim ReedHealth reporterGetty ImagesSome high-street clinics are putting lives at risk by allowing unqualified non-specialists to carry out baby scans, the Society of Radiographers (SoR) has warned.The trade union says its members have seen examples of pregnant women being incorrectly diagnosed with serious health conditions and given dangerous advice.Other expectant mums have been sent to hospital after being told an abnormality meant they would need to end the pregnancy only to find their baby was completely healthy.It is concerned that anyone using an ultrasound machine can call themselves a sonographer and offer the service - often sold as a reassurance, souvenir or sexing scan - ahead of the routine 20-week NHS check.\"One time, we had a lady referred [to hospital] from a private clinic, who was eight or nine weeks pregnant,\" says Elaine Brooks, Midlands regional officer at the SoR.\"The sonographer at the private clinic said there was no heartbeat and that the baby was very, very malformed, and they sent her in for an induced miscarriage.\"We started scanning the lady, who was in tears, and on the scan there was a clearly beautiful nine-week pregnancy with a heartbeat. It was absolutely fine.\"A BBC investigation in 2020 uncovered similar failures in the diagnosis of serious medical issues during private baby scans.It heard reports of women who were bleeding and in pain being accepted for scans, rather than being told to contact their doctor.Bad practice and sexual misconductThe trade union, which is also the professional body for medical imaging, says it has seen other examples of bad practice by some private clinics including:Major foetal abnormalities such as spina bifida or polycystic kidneys being missedEctopic pregnancies, where the fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, either not being diagnosed or being falsely diagnosedA radiographer continuing to work as a private sonographer despite having been struck off and banned from working for the NHS due to sexual misconduct The president of the SoR, Katie Thompson, said there were some \"really great\" private services offering checks with properly trained staff, but she was particularly concerned about the growth of pop-up clinics in shopping centres and on high streets selling souvenir images or scans to reveal the sex of the baby.She said she was aware of another case where a private scan late in pregnancy did not record the baby was still breech or lying bottom first in the uterus. The mother was not immediately referred to the NHS and the baby later died. Getty ImagesPrivate clinics often offer reassurance or sexing scans before the standard NHS anomaly scan which is normally offered between 18 and 21 weeks into the pregnancyThe SoR is now calling for sonographer to become a protected job title in the UK in the same way as dietician, podiatrist, art therapist or radiographer.That would mean only those who are properly qualified and registered with a regulatory body would be allowed to use that job description.Many private sonographers are already qualified midwives or radiographers, and  accredited training courses are also available, although this is currently not a legal requirement.Individual sonographers can also decide to join the Register of Clinical Technologists, which the public can then search to see if certain standards have been met, but again participation is voluntary.The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care recently carried out a public interest test of that register and has written to the government to say the \"risks appear sufficiently high\" that it should consider if stronger regulation of sonographers may be needed.The Care Quality Commission which inspects private clinics said many were providing good quality care, but it \"remains concerned that some are not\" with worries over staff training, consent policies and procedures for escalating unusual findings. Where its inspections identify concerns it said it would \"hold providers to account and make clear that action is required to ensure staff are adequately trained\".In a statement, the Department of Health said the safety of patients was paramount and the regulation of all healthcare professionals was kept under review.\"We will carefully consider any proposals from professional bodies regarding this,\" added a spokesman.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJane WakefieldTechnology reporterGetty ImagesMany of us moan about calling call centres, but would dealing with AI be an improvement?Ask ChatGPT whether AI will replace humans in the customer service industry, and it will offer a diplomatic answer, the summary of which is \"they will work side by side\".Humans though, are not so optimistic.Last year, the chief executive of Indian technology firm Tata Consultancy Services, K Krithivasan, told the Financial Times that AI may soon mean that there is \"minimal need\" for call centres in Asia.Meanwhile, AI will autonomously resolve 80% of common customer service issues by 2029, predicts business and technology research firm Gartner.There is currently a lot of hype around \"AI agents\". That is the term given to AI systems that can operate more autonomously and make decisions.They could turbo-charge current non-AI chatbots, known as \"rule-based chatbots\", which can only answer a set list of questions.My own recent experience with parcel delivery firm Evri's chatbot illustrates the existing, non-AI state of play.My parcel had not arrived, and Ezra (the name of the chatbot), offered to \"get this resolved straight away\".It asked for a tracking reference, and after I had typed that in, it told me that my parcel had been delivered.I could request proof of delivery, and when I did so it showed me a photo of the package… at the wrong front door. And there was no option to advance the conversation after this \"evidence\" was shown.In response, Evri tells the BBC it is investing £57m to further improve the service.\"Our intelligent chat facility uses tracking data to suggest the most helpful responses and ensure the customer's parcel is delivered as soon as possible, if this has not happened as scheduled,\" it says.\"Our data confirms the vast majority of people get the answers they need from our chat facility, first time, within seconds.  We're always reviewing feedback to ensure our services are as helpful as possible, and we continue to make enhancements on a rolling basis.\"On the flipside, rival parcel delivery firm DPD had to disable its less rule-bound AI chatbot after it criticised the company and swore at users.Getty ImagesCompanies around the world are adding AI to their existing chatbotsGetting the balance right between being on brand and genuinely helping customers is a tricky one for businesses to grapple with as they migrate to AI.Some 85% of customer service leaders are exploring, piloting or deploying AI chatbots, according to Gartner. But it also found that only 20% of such projects are fully meeting expectations.\"You can have a much more natural conversation with AI,\" says Garner analyst Emily Potosky.\"But the downside is the chatbot could hallucinate, it could give you out-of-date information, or tell you completely the wrong thing. For parcel delivery I would say rules-based agents are great because there are only so many permutations of questions about someone's package.\"Resources and money are among the key reasons businesses may be considering the move from human to AI customer service. But Ms Potosky points out that it isn't a given that AI will be cheaper than human agents.\"This is a very expensive technology,\" she says.The first thing that any business wanting to replace humans with AI will have to do is ensure that they have extensive training data.\"There's this idea that knowledge management becomes less important because generative AI can solve the fact that their knowledge is not particularly well organised, but actually the opposite is the case,\" adds Ms Potosky.\"Knowledge management is more important when deploying generative AI.\"Joe Inzerillo, chief digital officer at software giant Salesforce, tells the BBC that call centres provide fertile training grounds for AIs, particularly ones that have been moved to low-cost areas such as the Philippines and India.This is because a lot of staff training will have been done, which the AI can also learn from.\"You have a huge amount of documentation, and that's all really great stuff for the AI to have when it is going to take over that first line of defence,\" he says.Salesforce's AI-powered customer service platform, AgentForce, is currently being used by a range of customers from Formula 1, to insurance firm Prudential, restaurant-booking website Open Table, and social media site Reddit.Mr Inzerillo says that when Salesforce first put the platform through its paces it learned some valuable lessons about how to make the AI seem more human-like.\"While a human might say 'sorry to hear that', the agent just opened a ticket,\" says Mr Inzerillo.So the AI was trained to show more sympathy, especially when a customer has a problem.Salesforce also found that not allowing the agent to talk about competitors proved problematic.\"This backfired when customers asked legitimate questions about integrating Microsoft Teams with Salesforce,\" says Mr Inzerillo. \"The agent refused to help because Microsoft appeared on our competitor list.\"The firm subsequently replaced that rigid rule.Salesforce has ambitious plans for the continuing rollout of its AI agents, and so far it claims that they are a hit with its customers. It also says that the vast majority of customers, 94%, are choosing to interact with AI agents when given the option.\"We've seen customer satisfaction rates that are in excess of what people get with humans – then AI can unlock the next level of customer service,\" says Mr Inzerillo.It has also meant that the firm has cut customer service costs by $100m, but he was keen to play down recent headlines that suggest this has led to 4,000 jobs being slashed.\"A very large percentage of those people got redeployed in other areas around customer service.\"Fiona ColemanFiona Coleman says there will always be times when she wants to speak to a humanFiona Coleman runs QStory, a firm which is using AI to offer human call centre workers more flexibility in their shift patterns. Its customers include eBay and NatWest.While she sees the value in AI improving working conditions, she is not sure the technology can ever replace humans entirely.\"There are times where I don't want to have a digital engagement, and I want to speak to a human,\" she says.\"Let's see what it looks like in five years' time - whether an AI can do a mortgage application, or talk about a debt problem. Let's see whether the AI has got empathetic enough.\"The use of AI in customer service could, in fact, already be facing a backlash.Legislation currently proposed in the US to move off-shore call centres back to America also requires businesses to disclose the use of AI, and transfer a caller to a human if asked to do so.Meanwhile, Gartner predicted that by 2028 the EU may mandate what is called 'the right to talk to a human\" as part of its consumer protection rules.Read more global business stories",

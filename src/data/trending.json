Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "22 minutes agoBBCThe Observer headline declares \"Blackmail over Greenland\" after US President Donald Trump announced \"rising tariffs on the UK and European allies until he gets control of the Danish territory\". A striking image of red-and-white Greenland flags waved by protesters in front of snow-capped hills dominates the front page. \"Greenland is not for sale!\" read several of their posters.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anger at Trump's tariffs leads the Sunday Times. Trump \"blindsided his Nato allies\" with the move, it says. Meanwhile, Sir Keir's aide Darren Jones has been accused of launching a \"briefing war\" against Health Secretary Wes Streeting.For the Sunday Telegraph, Trump's actions amount to a \"trade war\". The paper highlights the PM's comments that the tariffs are \"completely wrong\", and that is backed in an editorial column by former US national security adviser John Bolton, who declares: \"This is the worst move of his presidency.\" Separately, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch tells the paper the Conservatives are the only party that will stop Britain becoming a \"poodle\" state.The Greenland tariffs also lead the Independent website. Trump has said the 10% trade fees will remain in place unless a deal is reached to sell the Danish territory to the US by the start of February, the paper reports. A photo of protesters waving Greenland flags in Copenhagen takes up much of the front page.The Mail on Sunday has gotten hold of a \"secret defection memo\" that it says fell into the hands of Tory leader Kemi Badenoch before Robert Jenrick's move to Reform. The memo is alleged to recommend Jenrick style himself as the \"new sheriff in town\", which the Mail dubs \"a bizarre plot\". In a royal exclusive, the Mail says Princess Eugenie has cut Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor out of her life.Following Jenrick's defection, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage tells the Sunday Express it's time for the right to unite behind his party. \"They want to fiddle with the plumbing and we think it needs a brand new boiler,\"  Farage said of the differences between the Tories and Reform.\"I will be free\" writes the Daily Star, as it says killer nurse Lucy Letby has told \"fellow lags and prison staff\" her convictions will be \"quashed within months\". Letby is currently serving 15 whole-life terms after she was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims.A photo of the Duke of Sussex next to King Charles leads the Sunday Mirror as they describe \"Harry's lonely trip home\". While \"both are in London\", the pair will not see each other this week.The Sunday People reports Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has undergone a \"brain scan after fall\". Her \"hospital shock\" comes \"just days before tour\".A TV row gives the Sun on Sunday its front page lead. It reports \"fury at anti-Muslim posts\" that have been discovered in the social media feed of a contestant on the upcoming series of BBC One's The Apprentice is caught in a \"race rant storm\". Contestant Levi Hague has apologised for making comments containing \"truly awful language\" in posts written more than a decade ago. The series is produced by an independent production company and the BBC said in a statement it had asked the company for \"further assurances on their social media checks given the process has not been completed to a satisfactory standard in this instance\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents. The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer.Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and \"using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity\".The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from \"stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering\" with their work. \"The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,\" it says. In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters\".The White House also criticised the ruling.\"This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,\" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. \"Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.\"Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city. There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.On Saturday, the Minnesota National Guard posted on X that troops \"are on standby, ready to assist local law enforcement and public safety agencies.\" The post added that National Guard troops will wear high-visibility yellow vests \"to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms\".Additionally on Friday, the justice department  announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.\"A reminder to all those in Minnesota:  No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey. \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,\" Walz said in a statement.",

    "body": "Ant and Dec have apologised for promoting their new podcast with a video that has been criticised for containing imagery that was insensitive and may be triggering for people struggling with mental health.Social media users characterised the opening shot of the clip - showing a pair of feet dangling above the ground - as evoking \"suicide imagery\" and \"triggering\".The TV presenters said in a statement: \"We did not mean to cause any offence with this promo video and we are sorry if it upset anyone.\"The clip was created to promote their podcast, Hanging Out With Ant & Dec, which is due to launch later this month as part of their new digital entertainment channel. It has now been deleted.The video, which was shared on Instagram and X on Friday, opened with a close-up image of feet suspended in the air, before showing the duo pegged to a washing line.Former X Factor contestant and mental health advocate Katie Waissel described the video as \"triggering, insensitive and frankly reckless to push out as 'entertainment'\".\"This opening visual of feet suspended above the ground is not a harmless 'play on words',\" she wrote, adding: \"The suicide imagery is impossible to ignore.\"Other social media users called the clip \"insensitive\", \"triggering\" and in \"poor taste\". Ant and Dec said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"taken on board comments\" and deleted the video.The podcast will see the duo catch up about their lives as well as taking questions and comments from listeners.It is part of their new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as \"new digital formats\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.While formal identification is yet to take place, police said they believed this person to be Grace. The discovery was made on Thursday but her body was unable to be recovered due to tide times and conditions.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"This was a deeply upsetting incident, and I cannot begin to understand the heartbreak felt by all the loved ones of those involved.\"Vickers said they had spoken to Grace's family and updated them, and were continuing to support them with specially trained officers.\"Understandably, they have asked for their privacy, and we would ask that this is respected,\" he said.Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaPolice said her body was discovered at about 08:30 GMT on Thursday on the rocks at Withernsea beach, following extensive searches over the past 14 days. They added that \"despite every effort it was not possible to safely recover Grace before high tide yesterday\".Officers said they were able to recover her body on Saturday morning with the help of HM Coastguard and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.Humberside Police thanked everyone who had offered or assisted in the search.Vickers added: \"Our thoughts and sincere sympathies will always remain with the families of Grace and Sarah Keeling, and Mark Ratcliffe following this utter tragedy.\"Police had previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".Family HandoutMark Ratcliffe was described by his family as a \"selfless hero\"A major operation was launched at 15:10 GMT following reports of people in the water. It involved HM Coastguard, emergency services, the RNLI and included helicopters and lifeboats.Ratcliffe, from Withernsea, was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. In a tribute, his family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".The body of Sarah Keeling, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, was recovered later the same evening.Her close friend Joanne Gee said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".An inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January and adjourned to a later date.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoHafsa KhalilBereaved families ‘horrified’ over politicians entering social media ban debate, says RussellThe father of a teenager who took her own life after viewing suicide and self-harm content online has said banning under-16s from social media would be wrong.Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, told BBC's Newscast that the government should enforce existing laws rather than \"implementing sledgehammer techniques like bans\".The foundation he set up in Molly's honour is among a number of children's charities and online safety organisations to sign a joint statement opposing such a move.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out an under-16 social media ban, after Australia imposed one in December.The House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for a more nuanced ban next week, which could be added to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill as an amendment. Many Labour MPs and officials have said they expect the UK government to follow Australia's example, with several other European nations weighing similar laws. Health Secretary Wes Streeting this week indicated he was in favour of a ban, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said she would bring one in if her party won the next election.But Ian Russell - who has campaigned for better online protections for children since his daughter took her own life in 2017 aged 14 - says bereaved families are \"horrified\" at the way politicians had capitalised on the issue.\"Many of them have said things like: 'this is not something that should be a party political issue'.\"The government should instead be enforcing laws already on the books more robustly, he argued.Russell FamilyMolly Russell was aged 14 when she took her own life after viewing suicide and self-harm content onlineRussell expressed concerns about the \"unintended consequences\" of a ban, which he said would \"cause more problems\".\"At the heart of it are companies that put profit over safety,\" he said. \"That has got to change - and I don't think that we're that far away from it changing it - which is why its slightly exasperating that we're going through these same arguments again now about bans.\"It's not far away - we can build on what we've got far better than simply implementing sledgehammer techniques like bans that will have unintended consequences and cause more problems.\"An inquest in 2022 found social media content contributed \"more than minimally\" to Molly's death.The Molly Rose Foundation, a suicide prevention charity named after Russell's daughter, and organisations including the NSPCC, Parent Zone and Childnet, called a ban the \"wrong solution\".\"It would create a false sense of safety that would see children - but also the threats to them - migrate to other areas online,\" they wrote in a joint statement.\"Though well-intentioned, blanket bans on social media would fail to deliver the improvement in children's safety and wellbeing that they so urgently need.\"Instead of this \"blunt response\", a \"broader and more targeted\" approach was needed, said the statement, which was also signed by two child mental health practitioners.Existing law should be \"robustly enforced\" to ensure social media sites, personalised games and AI chatbots were not accessible to under-13s, it said, while all social media platforms should have evidence-based blocks for features that are considered risky for children of different ages.The statement urged the government to strengthen the Online Safety Act to compel online companies to \"deliver age-appropriate experiences\".It suggested: \"Just as films and video games have different ratings reflecting the risk they pose to children, social media platforms have different levels of risk too and their minimum age limits should reflect this.\"Within the first few days of Australia bringing in its under-16s ban, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said around 550,000 accounts had been blocked. Teenagers expressed different reactions to the ban, ranging from feeling freer to it having little image on their online habits.Sir Keir said this week that he had been watching Australia's ban and that \"all options are on the table\" for the UK.After announcing her support for a ban last week, Badenoch defended her position to the BBC on Saturday.\"It is quite clear that a lot of social media spaces are not for children, and we don't let children go into a nightclub, so why are we letting them go to places where the content is not suitable for them?\"The Lib Dems' proposal, due to be considered in the Lords, would see social media platforms graded like age ratings for films.Under the plan, platforms using addictive algorithmic feeds or hosting \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users aged over 16, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would become adult-only.If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "11 hours agoJohn SudworthJerusalemGetty ImagesThe White House has announced the first members of its Gaza \"Board of Peace\", and the list of names will do little to dispel the criticism from some quarters that the US president's plan resembles, at its heart, a colonial solution imposed over the heads of the Palestinians.There are still several unknowns - namely who else might be added, and the exact structure of what is currently a rather complicated layout.So far, no Palestinian names are included on the two separate senior boards that have been officially unveiled.One is a \"founding Executive Board\", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.\"Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue.\"I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody,\" the president said last October.There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both.But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza.Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member.In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success.Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman.Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join.In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace.Getty ImagesAid groups have accused Israel of continuing restrictions on their workMajor challenges remain to both of those goals.The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.While aid groups say there has been some improvements, they accuse Israel of imposing continuing restrictions upon their work.Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it.Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself.Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza.As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be.Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state.Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms.How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.",

    "body": "13 hours agoAmy WalkerAndrea BradyJessica Brady contacted her GP practice more than 20 times feeling unwellA new system urging doctors to \"think again\" if they are unable to pin down a diagnosis after seeing a patient three times - named Jess's Rule - is to be advertised in every GP surgery in England from next week. The NHS initiative is named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced stage four cancer in 2020 aged 27.Before her eventual diagnosis, Jess had contacted her GP on more than 20 occasions after feeling unwell, but was told her symptoms were related to long Covid and that she was \"too young for cancer\".Her mother, Andrea Brady, welcomed the government rollout of the posters. She told BBC Breakfast: \"We still need to trust our doctors but trust ourselves as well.\"Under the patient safety initiative, GPs are asked to take a \"fresh eyes\" approach if they have been unable to offer a patient a substantiated diagnosis or their symptoms have escalated after three appointments.Jess, an engineer at Airbus, became ill in June 2020. Andrea said her family initially assumed it was something minor, \"but that wasn't what happened for Jess\".Her symptoms, which included unexplained weight loss, night sweats and vomiting, then worsened. \"It was very, very painful... to see the impact on Jess not just physically but the toll it was taking on her mentally,\" said Andrea.Jess had contact with six different doctors at her GP surgery and three face-to-face consultations with a family doctor, but no referral to a specialist was made.Her family then arranged a private appointment and she was referred to a specialist,   who gave Jess a terminal cancer diagnosis of adenocarcinoma - cancer of the glands that line the organs - in November.She died three weeks later, just days before Christmas 2020.Andrea said her daughter was \"trying to be really resilient and advocate for herself\" before her diagnosisThe government said the consultation room posters would improve patient safety by prompting doctors to \"revisit patient records, challenge initial assumptions and remain alert to warning signs that might otherwise be missed\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Every patient deserves to be heard, and every serious illness deserves to be caught early. \"Jess's Rule makes that possible - reminding clinicians to take a fresh look when symptoms persist, and empowering patients to speak up about their care.\"Andrea said the family wanted to follow what Jess had \"really wanted to start when she was diagnosed, which was to create some positive change\".\"It's taken five years but to know now that Jess's rule is out there and happening and is being received really positively and proactively by primary care colleagues is really, really important,\" she added.She said the rule was a \"two-way thing\" intended to benefit both patients and GPs.The posters were designed by Jess's parents Andrea and Simon in partnership with NHS England and the Department of Health, and funded by the Jessica Brady Cedar Trust established in her honour.Dr Claire Fuller, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"Encouraging GP teams to challenge a diagnosis when it matters most could save lives by avoiding missed or late diagnoses.\"",

It comes after an earlier calendar he produced in 2021 collected £10,000 for the hospice. Steph Peters, the hospice's head of marketing and communications, said Laybourne's commitment to help the facility was \"truly extraordinary\".Phil LaybourneThis red stag is also included in the calendar for September \"We are enormously grateful to Phil and everyone involved, whose support helps ensure that compassionate hospice care continues to be available to local families when they need it most,\" she said.\"We look forward to our continuing partnership and to seeing what his next project will bring.\"Steve Bangs, chief executive of Pegasus Homes, said: \"We're so incredibly proud of Phil's fantastic achievement in creating this wonderful calendar and using his passion for photography to raise such a significant amount of money for a cause close to his heart.Laybourne, from Wooburn Green in Buckinghamshire, said he wanted to bring in \"much-needed funds for an incredible organisation\".Thames HospiceLaybourne (third from left) handed over the £13,300 to the hospice following another fundraising projectRelated internet linksMore from the BBC",

    "body": "3 hours agoHenri AstierandBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterReutersProtesters in Greenland rallied on Saturday against any US move acquire the territoryA threat by President Donald Trump to impose fresh tariffs on eight allies opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland has drawn condemnation from European leaders.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the move was \"completely wrong\", while French President Emmanuel Macron called it \"unacceptable\".The comments came after Trump announced a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland would come into force on 1 February but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached. Mr Trump insists the autonomous Danish territory is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force.Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in Greenland and Denmark on Saturday in protest at the proposed US takeover.Greenland is sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.Trump has previously said Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\".Greenland: 'Diplomatic channels are the way to go' US speaker tells BBC before tariff announcementEuropean countries have rallied to Denmark's support. They have argued that the security of the Arctic region should be a joint Nato responsibility.France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have dispatched a small number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.Announcing the new tariffs in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump said those countries were playing \"a very dangerous game\". At stake, he said, was the \"Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet\".He said the proposed 10% levy to be introduced next month on goods exported to the US would rise to 25% in June and remain \"payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\".In his response, Starmer said: \"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.\"France's Emmanuel Macron said: \"Tariff threats are unacceptable in this context...  We will not be swayed by any intimidation.\"Swedish PM Ulf Kristersson said: We won't let ourselves be blackmailed.\"\"Sweden is currently having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway and the United Kingdom to find a joint response,\" he added.European Council President Antonio Costa stated: \"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law...  which of course begins within the territory of the member states of the European Union.\"Denmark's foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the threat had \"come as a surprise\". Meanwhile, German MEP Manfred Weber, head of the conservative EPP group in the European Parliament, said Trump's move raised questions about the still-to-be-ratified EU-US trade deal negotiated last year.Brussels and Washington clinched a deal that agreed a US tariff on all EU goods of 15% and that the 27-member bloc would open its markets to US exporters with 0% tariffs on certain products.\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" Weber posted on X. \"The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold,\" he added.ReutersTrump has recently escalated his drive to acquire GreenlandThe US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, however, said Denmark \"just doesn't have the resources or the capacity to do what needs to be done in the northern region\".He told Fox News the life of Greenlanders would be \"safer, stronger and more prosperous under the umbrella of the United States\".Trump has often mused that \"tariff\" is his favourite word, and he has made clear that he views it as something of a blunt instrument with which to convince – or coerce – countries around the world to align their policies with the desired outcomes of the White House.But his announcement represents a significant escalation in his recently rekindled drive to acquire Greenland, despite their opposition.It is unclear what immediately prompted the tariffs announcement, which Trump first hinted at while speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday.While in recent weeks he has repeatedly said that a variety of options – including the potential use of military force – remained on the table, the announcement comes just days after US and Danish officials agreed to set up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island.In Washington's diplomatic and political circles, that announcement was seen by many as a \"best-case\" scenario for Denmark and its European allies – one that would, at the very least, delay any decision or further escalation from the White House.Instead, the latest tariffs have injected a newfound sense of urgency into the issue and strained relations with important Nato allies and trading partners.EPAProtesters in Copenhagen waved Greenland's white and red flag in support of self-determinationOpinion polls suggest 85% of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the US.Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Danish cities as well as in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement.In the Danish capital, Copenhagen, placards were held up reading: \"Hands Off Greenland\" and \"Greenland for Greenlanders\".\"We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination,\" said Camilla Siezing, heads of Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations.In Nuuk, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen joined protesters holding signs reading \"Greenland is not for sale\" and \"we shape our future\" as they headed for the US consulate.The rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".Watch: Why is there so much international interest in Greenland?More on this story",

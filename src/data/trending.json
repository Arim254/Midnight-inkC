    "body": "5 days agoWill VernonYury KrylovA British child chess prodigy has swept the board at a national competition, earning her a place among the top 50 women in the world for the blitz category of speed chess.Ten-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan won eight games in a row at the UK Women's Blitz Championship in Royal Leamington Spa at the weekend - triumphing over much older and more experienced players.\"I don't mind who I compete against, I only care about the game,\" Bodhana told the BBC following her latest win.Malcolm Pein, from the English Chess Federation, described Bodhana as a \"generational talent with no equivalent in any other sport\".\"It's hard to say what is more remarkable - the fact that a 10-year-old is a top seed in a British chess championship, or that she strolls to victory by a huge margin, leaving three other England internationals in her wake,\" he added.Bodhana, from Harrow in north-west London, said she was \"really happy\" about her victory. \"Chess helps me with so many other things, at school it helps with maths, art and music.\"Her father, Siva, said his daughter was very determined, and he and his wife were proud of her: \"She is doing her best, and we are supporting her.\"It is the latest success in Bodhana's phenomenal career. In August, she became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title - the second-highest ranking in women's chess, below grandmaster.  Yury KrylovBodhana became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title earlier this yearLast year, she made history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport, at the age of just nine. Bodhana says she wants to become the youngest grandmaster in history. The current recordholder is American chess player Abhimanyu Mishra, who claimed the title at the age of just 12. Blitz is a type of speed chess in which each game lasts no more than ten minutes.",

    "body": "Flights returning to normal after Airbus warning grounded planes1 hour agoHafsa KhalilNurPhoto via Getty ImagesThousands of Airbus planes are being returned to normal service, officials say, after being grounded for hours due to a warning that solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers.The aerospace giant - based in France - said around 6,000 of its A320 planes had been affected with most requiring a quick software update.  Some 900 older planes need a replacement computer.French Transport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the updates \"went very smoothly\" for more than 5,000 planes.\"Fewer than 100 aircraft\" still needed the update, Airbus had told him, according to local media.\"Software updates were already rolled out overnight on virtually all devices,\" Tabarot explained.On Saturday morning, Air France appeared to be experiencing some disruption, with several flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport delayed or cancelled.But while flights saw limited disruptions, he said it was more \"complicated in other countries\", such as the US, where the issue emerged on the same weekend as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest travel periods of the year.American Airlines said 340 of its planes were affected and that it expected \"some operational delays\", but added the vast majority of updates were being completed on Friday or Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be \"limited\".In the UK, disruption at airports has been limited. London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations. Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems.British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.On Saturday, Easyjet said it had completed the update on a \"significant number\" of its aircrafts, and plan to operate as normal.Wizz Air is also running as normal, having rolled out updates overnight.In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights after confirming around a third of its fleet was impacted, with disruption expected to continue all weekend despite the majority of aircraft having already undergone the update.Airbus discovered the issue after a JetBlue Airways plane flying between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude and emergency landed in October. At least 15 people were injured.The firm identified a problem with the aircraft's computing software which calculates a plane's elevation, and found that at high altitudes, data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. As well as the A320, the company's best-selling aircraft, the A318, A319 and the A321 models were also impacted.While approximately 5,100 of the planes could see their issues resolved with the simple software update, for around 900 older planes, a replacement computer would be needed.These planes would need to be grounded until resolved.The length of time that takes will depend on the availability of replacement computers.",

    "body": "1 hour agoCachella SmithWatch: The bride and groom are cheered and showered with confettiAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has married his partner Jodie Haydon, becoming the country's first leader to marry while in office.The pair tied the knot in the capital, Canberra, on Saturday afternoon local time - the day after the final sitting of the parliamentary year. \"We are absolutely delighted to share our love and commitment to spending our future lives together, in front of our family and closest friends,\" Albanese said in a brief statement.The couple became engaged on Valentine's Day last year. The Labor leader's proposal and the wedding reception both took place at his official residence, The Lodge.ReutersUntil the big day, the wedding plans had been kept under wraps due to concerns about security and potential disruptions.In attendance were Ms Haydon's parents as well as Albanese's son from his previous marriage.Albanese's dog Toto acted as ring bearer while the couple walked back down the aisle to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\".The prime minister also shared a video on his official social media accounts showing the happy couple walking down the aisle as guests showered them in confetti. Several of Albanese's cabinet ministers attended the ceremony. ReutersAt the reception, their first dance was to The Way You Look Tonight by Frank Sinatra.The celebrations also featured custom-made beer cans printed with the image used to announce their engagement.The couple are set to honeymoon in Australia from Monday and Friday next week - plans that were pared back after his re-election in May.Albanese, 62, and Ms Haydon, 47, first met at a business dinner in Melbourne in 2020, while the former was leader of the opposition.ReutersMs Haydon appeared during Albanese's 2022 and 2025 election campaigns, and was seen alongside the PM at major events, including the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II and a state dinner hosted by former US President Joe Biden.Albanese also made Australian history by becoming the first prime minister to get engaged while in office.The couple said in a joint statement at the time that they were \"so lucky to have found each other\".",

    "body": "Donald Trump has said that he will pardon the former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking charges in a US court last year. The US president said Hernández had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly\" in a social media post announcing the move on Friday.Hernández was found guilty in March 2024 of conspiring to import cocaine into the US, and of possessing machine guns. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. Polls indicate the Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain4 days agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" the lead author of the research, Dr Alexa Mousley, told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge and part of the team responsible for the research, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"The director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Prof Tara Spires-Jones, who did not work on the research paper, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

I don't think there's that much information out there on how to actually get investment for small businesses,\" she said.The 31-year-old said when one product went viral in 2022, people wrongly assumed she was an overnight success and millionaire.\"I paid myself a small wage just so that we could live and get by but I didn't take any massive chunks of money, especially in those days when we started go viral, because every single penny that was made had to be reinvested to keep up with the demands,\" Zoe said.She said she feels that there's a lot of pressure for female founders to be perfect and to always make perfect decisions – something she tries to challenge online.\"It's really, really important, especially for people that are wanting to become entrepreneurs, to show that it isn't all highlights and not everything is rosy, and you don't just sell out instantly. \"There's a lot of hard work and a lot of downs and negatives that do come with it,\" she said.Lauren Bell says she's moving her entire business to the United States after struggling to find serious investment hereEntrepreneur Lauren Bell said it took four years before she was able to take a salary from her business, Cosi Care.The 33-year-old created a gadget to help her brother cope with eczema, which he has had throughout his life.Lauren said: \"It's so challenging to get the big cheques. People don't support women. People almost don't believe that women can achieve what men can achieve.\"They see me in a pink suit with a nice Welsh accent, and they just don't believe that you can reach those levels.\"The entrepreneur said that while she's really proud of what she's achieved as a woman in a STEM industry, it's a \"shame\" she didn't have more support in the early days.Lauren, a design graduate, has recently won a million-pound investment and will be moving the entire business to the US soon.\"I'm moving all of our employees there. I'm manufacturing in America and moving everything over to America, which is a real shame, because I did really try and do it in the UK, but there just wasn't the same scale of support for female-owned businesses,\" she said.Dr Sarah Marks said many female entrepreneurs faced returning to employment after struggling to make a livingDr Sarah Marks from Swansea University agreed business owners are under pressure to present themselves as successful online.\"For people to really be successful and to really consider themselves as a successful entrepreneur, they actually need to be generating quite a lot of income, and my research suggests that actually the vast majority of women do not generate anywhere near what will be a market equivalent income for themselves,\" she said.The lecturer in the school of management said her research showed entrepreneurship often doesn't provide sustainable living for women, with many giving up.\"Women are actually denied a kind of platform in which to complain about how little money they're earning... they don't want to be seen as greedy; they don't want to be seen as ungrateful and that can be a real pressure for women and a real burden,\" she said.A report published last month by the Women and Equalities committee found that female entrepreneurs face significant disadvantages in accessing finances, investment networks and support systems.The cross-party group of MPs found that while numerous programmes have been established to address the issue, they have had limited effect.A spokesperson for the UK government said it was \"putting women at the heart of its grown agenda to make the UK the best place for women-led businesses by tackling barriers and unlocking opportunities for them\".\"The Invest in Women Taskforce has secured over £500m in funding for women-led businesses over the past 12 months and investment in female entrepreneurs began in August this year,\" they said.The Welsh government said since May 2021, Business Wales had supported 2,301 start-ups led by women which is \"56% of all start-ups supported\".\"The Development Bank for Wales supports female entrepreneurs via many projects, including the Women Angel of Wales syndicate which increases the activity of female angel investors\" they added.More top stories",

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?54 minutes agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, in KyivGetty ImagesAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USYermak resigns after anti-corruption raidAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "5 hours agoYang TianandJames FitzGeraldWatch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah BeckstromThe Trump administration has halted all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) director has said.Joseph Edlow said the pause would be in place \"until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible\".It came hours after US President Donald Trump pledged to \"permanently pause migration\" from all \"third world countries\".The flurry of immigration decisions come in the wake of Wednesday's shooting, which left one soldier dead and another in a critical condition, and which officials have accused an Afghan national for perpetrating.While the first of these specifically targeted Afghans seeking to enter the US, other decisions have been far more wide-reaching.The USCIS - a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.But few details are known about Friday's directive.Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.The agency referred to a June proclamation that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. 'Third-world countries'Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan. During Trump's first term, he enacted a travel ban targeting multiple Muslim-majority countries.The UN has urged the US to observe international agreements on asylum seekers, news agency Reuters reported.Trump's reaction to the shooting amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.He told the BBC World Service's Newsday before Trump's latest remarks that the attacker's motive were unclear, and that radicalisation and mental illness could affect anyone. \"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality.\"Suspect in DC shooting is AfghanOfficials said the shooting suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, came to the US in 2021.He travelled under a programme that offered special protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in Afghanistan before their chaotic withdrawal and the return to power of the Taliban. Mr Lakanwal had been a member of a \"Zero Unit\" - an Afghan intelligence and paramilitary force that worked with the CIA - a former Afghan defence and security forces member told CBS.The US considered Zero Units to be among the most respected domestic forces in Afghanistan.The CIA's current director has confirmed that he previously worked with the US intelligence agency.FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in AfghanistanHe would have been vetted by the US both when he started working with the CIA and when he travelled to the US, a senior US official told CNN.A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.Mr Lakanwal was reportedly granted asylum after Trump returned to office, having applied in 2024.But his request for a green card - which shows a person has permanent residence in the US - is pending, an official told CBS.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "8 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterDowning Street has denied Rachel Reeves misled the public about the state of the public finances ahead of this week's Budget.In the run-up to Wednesday's statement, the chancellor repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her spending rules.But in a letter to MPs sent on Friday, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) revealed a forecast of higher wages - which she had not mentioned - would help her meet the rules.The Conservatives have accused Reeves of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes.Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the letter showed Reeves had \"lied to the public\" and should be sacked.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.The letter also reveals that on the 31 October, the OBR told the Treasury it was on course to meet its main rule of not borrowing for day-to-day spending, albeit by £4.2bn, less than the £9.9bn in \"headroom\" she had left herself last year.On 4 November, Reeves used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, she told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"These comments, along with her speech, fuelled speculation she needed to raise significant sums to meet her fiscal rules.However, the Office for Budget Responsibility has now confirmed that although it did indeed downgrade productivity, it also predicted this would be \"offset\" by higher wages increasing the government's tax revenues.That meant she had a surplus to meet both of her fiscal rules.A spokesperson for the Treasury said: \"We are not going to get into the OBR's processes or speculate on how that relates to the internal decision‑making in the build‑up to a Budget, but the Chancellor made her choices to cut the cost of living, cut hospital waiting lists and double headroom to cut the cost of our debt.\"But Reeves continued to indicate that she was likely to increase income tax rates.In her Downing Street press conference, she said: \"It is already clear that the productivity performance…is weaker than previously thought.\"She added: \"What I want people to understand ahead of that Budget, is the circumstances we face.\"In the end, Reeves backed away from hiking income tax rates, although her Budget still contained £26bn of tax rises, including by freezing income tax thresholds for a further three years, dragging more people into higher tax bands over time.In an interview with the Guardian newspaper, Reeves said: \"We did look, as everyone knows, at income tax and National Insurance, that was a responsible thing to do, because we didn't know the size of the downgrade, the productivity.\"The chancellor told the newspaper she had made \"fair and necessary\" choices, adding: \"I wasn't willing to cut public services, because people voted for change at the election.\"Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said that while Reeves had repeatedly talked about the productivity downgrade, she had \"failed to mention\" the offsetting effect of higher wages on the forecast.He added: \"It was all a smokescreen. Labour knew all along that they did not need to raise taxes and break their promises.\"It appears the country was deliberately misled to try to explain away Labour's decision to spend billions more on welfare.\"Asked whether Reeves had misled the public and the financial markets, the PM's spokesperson said: \"I don't accept that.\" He added: \"As she [Reeves] set out in the speech that she gave here (Downing Street), she talked about the challenges the country was facing and she set out her decisions incredibly clearly at the Budget.\"He added the government had increased the headroom for the Treasury to meet the fiscal rules, which would creates \"certainty and stability for business\".",

    "body": "Text scammers make tens of thousands a month - and spend it on designer shoes and bags 7 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandGuy LambertBBCDet Ch Insp Curtis says as many as 10,000 pieces of evidence have been seized\"They don't keep money, they spend it here and now.\"Det Ch Insp Paul Curtis is showing us around an evidence room piled high with designer shoes and handbags. Thousands of items are neatly stacked in plastic containers on wooden shelves.The items here have been seized from financial fraudsters, some of whom send scam texts - known as smishing - to victims. \"They like to live a lavish lifestyle,\" says Curtis. \"We have got somewhere between 8,500 and 10,000 items of evidence in this one room,\" he says, something that is \"the result of house searches and raids\" carried out by officers.The smell of fresh leather goods pervades the air. Brightly coloured Gucci stilettos catch the eye from a distance; it's a treasure trove of top-label kit worth tens of thousands of pounds.These purchases are an indication of how much cash they're making from their crimes and what they're spending it on.The term \"smishing\" is a combination of \"SMS\", or \"short message service\" - the technology behind text messages - and \"phishing\". Fraudsters send fake text messages - apparently from a bank or other trusted company - to trick people into disclosing personal information such as passwords and Pin numbers. The intention is to defraud them out of their money.Curtis is part of the Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit - a team made up of officers from the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police service.Although they're London police forces, the unit has a national remit, and is sponsored by the banking industry. It focuses on combating financial fraud.\"In a recent smishing case of ours, the defendant was sentenced on the basis of sending 15,000 messages in a five day period. That equated to making a hundred thousand pounds a month,\" he says.The senior officer was talking about Ruichen Xiong, a student from China who was convicted of the crime after driving around London in March of this year, sending messages to tens of thousands of potential victims.Xiong was sentenced to 58 weeks in prison at Inner London Crown Court in June after pleading guilty to fraud by representation.According to Ofcom, half of UK mobile users said they received a suspicious message between November 2024 and February 2025 via text or iMessage.'I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated'Gideon Rabinowitz, 64, lives in Newbury, Berkshire, and is a recent victim of smishing.Just two months ago, the former IT manager said he was cheated out of more than a thousand pounds after receiving a fraudulent text message.\"I felt like a massive fool, like I'd been violated,\" he says.Gideon Rabinowitz says he received a text out of the blue\"It really shook me. For a number of days after it really left me quite shaken. I felt very vulnerable and I don't know who to trust now.\"Mr Rabinowitz was led to believe he was being contacted by his bank who were reporting a suspicious payment on his account.In reality, he was being messaged by a scammer.\"It started with a text out of the blue asking if I recognised a transaction - yes or no. Two and half hours later I was out of pocket by £1400.\"He adds: \"In part it was about the money and it was also this feeling of being defrauded, of being looked up, because these people knew who I was. They knew where I live\".Scam text messages often pretend to be from large companies such as utility companies, banks or supermarkets. They usually include a link. Once the person clicks on it, they can be sent to a fraudulent website and asked for personal and financial information. The information can then be used to convince them to transfer money from their account.Smishing is primarily done through two devices; a Sim farm which holds multiple Sim cards, allowing criminals to bombard people with thousands of scam texts.The second is what's called an SMS Blaster. It tricks mobiles nearby into connecting with it, and then sends large numbers of fraudulent texts in a matter of seconds.Sim farms hold multiple cards at once for maximum efficiencyThe government says \"smishing scams have a devastating impact on their victims\".\"Our Telecoms Charter sets out clear action to secure SMS and reduce fraud across the telecoms sector\".\"We are also banning Sim farms. Banning these devices used to send thousands of scam texts will close down a key tool for criminals and safeguard consumers,\" it says.The ban is expected to come into effect late next year. It will make the possession or supply of Sim farms, without a specified reason, illegal.'Easy to do, hard to trace'One cyber expert said smishing was a difficult crime to solve and that there needs to be more education around fraudulent text messages.\"Smishing in and of itself is very hard to police because a lot of it comes from abroad and, even when it's done from within the UK it's very easy to do and hard to trace, \" says Ciaran Martin, the former Chief Executive of the National Cyber Security Centre.\"So while the police can sometimes take down big operations, we shouldn't look to the police as the strategic answer for this. \"The strategic answer is for people to understand that serious businesses don't ask you for money by text, and for businesses to find better ways of interacting with customers and verifying that interaction\".The advice from police is simple: do not click on the links in any unsolicited messages you receive. If you believe you're a victim of fraud, report to Action Fraud, report to your bank, and forward the message to 7726 so the mobile networks can investigate further.Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell.

    "body": "New powers allowing mobile phones to be seized from illegal migrants without arresting them have come into force. The government said it will help gather intelligence on smuggling gangs organising small boat crossings to the UK.The Home Office said seizures will begin on Monday at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent, with technology on site ready to download intelligence from devices.Officers will be able to demand that migrants remove their coats to search for phones and also check their mouths for SIM cards.The National Crime Agency said the information collected could speed up investigations into smuggling gangs.Border security minister Alex Norris said: \"We promised to restore order and control to our borders, which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.\"That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Labour had confined itself to \"cosmetic tweaks\" and that there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel.He said the Conservatives would leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), something Labour has rejected in favour of reforming the treaty.\"With more than 41,000 people arriving in 2025, the government needs to get a proper grip on the situation,\" he added.The Refugee Council warned it was important that the new powers were used proportionately. It said phones were a lifeline for vulnerable people who needed to remain in contact with their families.The new law also introduces offences that could leave perpetrators facing up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK.Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could face five years in prison.Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, said more than 4,000 disruptions against smuggling gangs had taken place since his unit was set up, including seizing cash and convicting key players.He said Monday marked a \"key moment\" to go further with extra tools to crack down on smugglers.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has also announced plans for \"significant changes\" to the asylum system to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.",

The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

You were loved by so many people, and we will all miss you forever.\"A loving husband, father, son, brother and the best grandad anybody could ever wish for. Sleep tight, we love you, we miss you.\"Mr Ratcliffe's son, in a Facebook post, thanked the RNLI, HM coastguards and the emergency services who had done \"all they could\" and worked tirelessly and relentlessly in awful weather conditions.\"Bye Dad, I miss you and I will never forget the true hero and role model you were,\" he wrote.Police said both families were being supported by specially trained officers.BBC/Joe BiltonThe police said officers were continuing to search for Grace KeelingAt 15:10 GMT on Friday, the coastguard responded to reports of \"a number of people in difficulty\" in the water.What followed was a huge search and rescue operation involving about 100 emergency workers, a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington, Skegness and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.The coastguard stood down their search at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon.The RNLI thanked members of the public who they said had \"assisted and supported\" the emergency services.\"This is a very tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families, friends and all those impacted,\" they said in a statement on Sunday.BBC/Becki BowdenFloral tributes have been placed close to the scene on the promenadePaul Whitehead, owner of Castle Cafe on the promenade said he had handed three minutes of CCTV footage taken from the front of the cafe over to the police.Mr Whitehead said several people ran across to help including two members of his staff. He said a lifebelt at the foot of the towers on the seafront was thrown into the sea to help the young woman but the undertow took her away.\"It's just an accident,\" he said, \"a tragic accident, and it has affected the town deeply.\"Mr Whitehead said he had lit three candles in St Matthew's Methodist church on Sunday, one for each of the three victims.Services took place at the church earlier to allow people to reflect on what had happened. People have also placed flowers on the promenade.  Janice Holgate, who travelled from Hull, said it had been \"absolutely devastating\" to hear what had happened.\"I had to pay my respects just to let the families know that people are thinking about them,\" she said.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this story",

    "body": "Teen girl educated in UK confirmed to have died in Swiss bar fire4 hours agoThomas MackintoshCharlotte Niddam/TikTokA former pupil at two British schools has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in a fire at a Swiss ski resort.In a post on social media, Charlotte Niddam's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.It comes as officials in Switzerland said on Sunday that they had identified all 40 victims of the New Year's Day fire in a bar in Crans-Montana.Charlotte, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College, a private school in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London.In the statement on Facebook, Charlotte's family wrote: \"It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our beautiful daughter and sister Charlotte.\"Details regarding the funeral arrangements will follow shortly. It is most likely on Thursday in Paris.\"Thank you for all your support those last few days.\"According to the Crans-Montana resort website, Charlotte had been working as a babysitter in the area.Yvette Cooper said  it was \"terrible news\" that Charlotte had been identified as one of victims of the fire.\"My thoughts are with all her family and friends after this devastating loss,\" she wrote on X.After the blaze, Immanuel College had said it was \"praying for a miracle\".Swiss President Guy Parmelin has called the fire \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.The bar that was the scene of the fire, Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana, was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating New Year's Day in the early hours of Thursday when the blaze began in the basement area.Prosecutors say that, according to initial investigations, the likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried \"too close to the ceiling\".An investigation into the causes of the blaze will focus on the materials used at the site, the bar's fire safety measures, its capacity and the number of people inside at the time, Valais Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud said.On Sunday, Valais cantonal police said all victims had been identified and were aged between 14 and 39 years old.The victims came from seven countries - though several held multiple nationalities.Swiss police said one of those victims identified was a 15-year-old who held triple citizenship with France, Israel and the UK. Other nationalities include Portuguese, Romanian, Belgian, French, Italian and Swiss.Another 35 people who were injured in the fire have been transferred to specialist burns units outside Switzerland as the country struggles to cope with the scale of the tragedy.",

    "body": "6 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorThe prime minister's very notable tilt on the UK's ties to the European Union post-Brexit on Saturday was designed to send a message to business, to Brussels and to other European capitals, as well as his backbenchers.Closer post-Brexit economic relations are now expected to be looked at as part of an annual process of bilateral talks rather than just at this year's formal review of the UK-EU deal.It was Downing Street's answer to political questions about a more ambitious Brexit reset involving rejoining the customs union with the EU.Some Labour backbenchers, union leaders and cabinet ministers have joined calls crystallised by Lib Dem moves in Parliament last year that led to a non-binding vote.Sir Keir Starmer gave a clear answer to my colleague Laura Kuenssberg that this was not the priority at the moment, as it goes against what he considers one of the successes of the past year: the signing of best-in-class deals on trade with the US and India, with more to come in the Middle East.Instead of the customs union, his focus is on a \"closer relationship\" with the single market, which would not mean ripping up those new trade deals elsewhere.\"We are better looking to the single market rather than the customs union for our further alignment,\" Sir Keir said.When the UK formally left the EU in January 2021, Boris Johnson's deal stressed freedom from EU regulations rather than frictionless trade for British exporters across Europe.Already, Sir Keir's \"Brexit reset\" envisages realigning with EU rules in three areas to help the free flow of trade: food and farm exports, electricity, and emissions trading.The British Chambers of Commerce last month published a list of further requests in other sectors to help exporters deal with post-Brexit red tape that has hit the trade of goods. It reported a majority of 989 business members in its own survey agreed that the UK-EU trade deal was not helping sales growth.A number of other areas could, feasibly, see a similar approach - alignment with single market rules - in exchange for reducing post Brexit barriers across manufacturing, in automotive, chemicals, or for example in arrangements for VAT.European capitals were underwhelmed by the lack of ambition in last year's reset, with the British rejection of some experts who floated the idea of the virtual readmission of British goods to the single market.The detail of arrangements on electricity, and food and farm standards is yet to be finalised. A plan for UK manufacturers to be part of the €150bn (£131bn) Security Action For Europe defence loan fund has stalled over the size of the membership fee, after some objections from France. Canada has joined the scheme.The UK has agreed a deal to rejoin the Erasmus university exchange and further negotiate a youth jobs scheme. This has helped clear the way for further UK-EU talks.Some UK insiders say the publication of the US National Security Strategy (NSS) last month has also changed the context on UK relations with Europe.The NSS said the US would \"cultivate resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\" and praised the \"growing influence of patriotic European parties\".In Downing Street, there is some recognition that even this rapidly changing world has changed again. Domestically, too, Labour expect to be outflanked on Brexit not just by the Liberal Democrats, but also the Green Party, which is targeting Labour's London heartlands in council elections in May.The prime minister's words yesterday are borne of a confluence of economics, politics and geopolitics as the UK starts a year that will mark the 10th anniversary of the Brexit referendum.",

    "body": "1 hour agoThomas MackintoshReutersDenmark's prime minister has told Donald Trump to \"stop the threats\" about taking over Greenland.Mette Frederiksen said \"it makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland\", adding: \"The US has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom.\"Her remarks come after Katie Miller - the wife of one of Trump's aides, Stephen Miller - tweeted a map of Greenland in the colours of the American flag alongside the word \"SOON\".Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of Greenland becoming an annexed part of the US, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth, and doubled down on his claims after Frederiksen's comments. In her statement, posted on the Danish government website, Frederiksen said she was addressing the US \"very directly\".She said Denmark - \"and thus Greenland\" - was a Nato member and covered by the alliance's security guarantee. Denmark already had a defence agreement with the US that gave it access to Greenland, she said, and Denmark had upped its investment in security in the Arctic region.\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have very clearly said that they are not for sale,\" she said.Hours later on Air Force One, Trump reiterated the goal. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it,\" he said.Earlier the Danish ambassador to the US responded to the post by Ms Miller - a right-wing podcaster and former aide to Trump during his first term - with a \"friendly reminder\" that the two countries were allies and saying Denmark expected respect for its territorial integrity.The exchange comes after the US carried out a major military operation against Venezuela on Saturday, capturing its president Nicolas Maduro and his wife and removing them to New York.Trump later said the US would \"run\" Venezuela and US oil companies would \"start making money for the country\".The US president has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland, a vast island in the Arctic. Trump has claimed that making it part of the United States would serve US security interests due to its strategic location and its abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. The Trump administration's recent move to appoint a special envoy to Greenland prompted anger in Denmark.Greenland, which has a population of 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.More on this story",

Strong winds have been causing drifting, with Network Rail Scotland reporting snow drifts up to 1.2m (4ft) on the line between Aberdeen and Dundee. Scottish regional airline Loganair has cancelled flights from Aberdeen and Inverness airports on Sunday and Monday following heavy snowfall.As the snow showers become heavier and more frequent during Sunday night, the Met Office is warning for the potential of another 20 to 30cm of snow.Further road and rail closures are possible and disruption to power is likely in some areas too.The Met Office also warned that mobile phone coverage could be affected.Hundreds of schools in northern Scotland will stay shut after the Christmas holidays on Monday.The return of pupils has been delayed in Aberdeenshire, Shetland and Orkney, while schools in Aberdeen will have a later start.A number of schools in Northern Ireland will also be closed on Monday.

The mercury dropped to -9.3C at Benson in Oxfordshire and -7.3C at Sennybridge in Powys.Sunday night into Monday morning was expected to be even colder with temperatures of -10C or -11C for forecast for some rural parts of Scotland and Wales.Although temperatures will slowly lift through the rest of this week, cold weather health alerts from the UK Health Security Agency remain in place across all of England until Friday. The HSA warns that the prolonged cold spell could lead a rise in deaths, particularly among the elderly or those with underlying health conditions.In Plymouth, four city centre churches have opened their doors to the homeless due to the drop in temperatures, and will offer hot drinks, clean bedding and specialist support.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / silver surferImage caption, Houses in Whitby, North Yorkshire, provided a splash of colour amid the snowfallWill snow, sleet or rain fall?Atlantic weather fronts are likely to bring more snow through this week.

The track will be crucial as there is likely to be a spell of heavy snow on the northern edge of the low and heavy rain to the south.

    "body": "4 hours agoThe US President ramping up \"pressure on Venezuela\" leads the Financial Times today after the White House warned of further armed force in Caracas if \"a series of conditions laid out\" by Marco Rubio is not met by Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, the paper reports. Over the weekend, the US captured the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro. The US accuses Maduro, who is charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences, of running a \"narco-terrorist\" regime - a claim he denies.Trump's warning to Caracas to toe the line or pay a \"big price\" is given full prominence on the Guardian's front page. US officials said they would keep 15,000 troops in the Caribbean in case there was need for fresh intervention \"if Venezuela's interim president did not accommodate their demands\", the paper reports. The Times also focuses on Trump's warning to \"Venezuela's new leader\" against defying the US. Following questions over the president's claim that the US would run the South American country, Trump said Delcy Rodríguez would \"pay a very big price\" if she \"doesn't do what's right\". The Daily Telegraph focuses on Donald Trump's possible next moves, with his sights set on Greenland. The paper includes a quote the president gave in an interview to the Atlantic, in which he states: \"We do need Greenland... we need it for defence.\" Trump has previously refused to rule out using force to secure control of Greenland.A handcuffed Maduro surrounded by US Drug Enforcement Administration officers takes up the majority of the Independent's front page, accompanied by words \"We are NOT at war\". US Secretary of State Marco Rubio insists \"America is at war with drug cartels, not with Venezuela\", the paper reports, as Caracas military leaders called for the release of their president. Labour MPs have accused Sir Keir Starmer of \"double standards\" for not condemning the US strikes on Venezuela and capture of Maduro, the Daily Mail reports. So far, Sir Keir has said he would \"shed no tears\" over \"America's Venezuela coup\". According to the paper, \"left-wing hardliners\" want the UK to criticise its \"greatest ally\".The i Paper takes a different approach, leading with Sir Keir's comments on the UK moving \"even closer\" to \"EU's single market\". The paper describes it as the \"starkest sign yet\" of a \"radically softer Brexit deal\". The Daily Express says Sir Keir has been accused of a \"full-blown Brexit betrayal\". The paper quotes Reform UK's Richard Tice on the matter, who says \"Brits will be rightly worried\" over Starmer's pursuit of closer relations with Europe. A picture of Anthony Joshua and the families of his two close friends and team members killed in a horror crash in Nigeria feature on the front page of the Daily Star. The British boxer shared the picture on social media showing him sitting alongside his mother and the mothers of Sina Ghami and Latif 'Latz' Ayodele, who died in the crash.The Sun focuses on AJ's \"pledge to families of 'brothers' Ghami and Ayodele who died in the crash. Their funerals took place at a London mosque on Sunday. A source told the Sun that AJ is \"fiercely loyal to his friends and family\" and \"will be there for them for the rest of their lives\". Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson is pictured in the Daily Mirror along with the agonising revelation that her twin babies have a rare genetic condition. \"I am grieving a life I thought I was going to have with my children,\" the 34-year-old is reported saying, after her twin girls were diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy. The US raid on Venezuela and the capture of its president, Nicolás Maduro, continues to feature prominently, with many papers choosing an image of the ousted leader in handcuffs as he arrived in New York for their front pages.The Daily Telegraph says Trump has now \"set his sights on Greenland\" after the raid on Caracas, as he says he needs the territory for defence against Russia and China. The paper acknowledges that a US invasion of Greenland is unlikely, but adds that the renewed threat may alarm European leaders.The Guardian tells its readers that the prospect of the US seizing direct control of Venezuela appears to be receding after Trump's warnings to the interim president, Delcy Rodríguez.  It describes the operation to depose Madura as a 'distorted fever dream' which was made real by Trump's return to power.A number of theories about the seizure of Maduro are highlighted by the Times. His son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduro Guerra, a Venezeulan congressman, is quoted voicing suspicions it was an inside job and that \"history will tell who the traitors were\".  Eva Bolinger, the biographer of the country's former leader, Hugo Chavez, alleges that President Trump made a deal with Rodriguez and \"everything else is just noise\".Domestic reaction to events in Venezuela is the focus of The Daily Mail, which claims Labour is \"tearing itself apart\" because Sir Keir Starmer has refused to describe the attack as illegal. It says the Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from left-wing MPs to criticise the US. Sir Keir initially said he wanted to establish the facts before adding that the government would \"shed no tears\" over the end of the Maduro Regime.The Daily Express claims Sir Keir Starmer is plotting what it calls a \"full blown Brexit betrayal\" by edging the UK closer to the EU single market. The I Paper's take is that his push for a \"softer Brexit\" is an attempt to appease what it calls \"unruly\" Labour MPs posing a threat to his leadership. Sir Keir has said the UK should align more closely with the EU if it is in the national interest.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoAlex BishBBC South East InvestigationsGetty ImagesA total of 57 million doses of unauthorised medication have been confiscated by government agencies over the last five yearsPatients who buy illicit painkillers, erectile dysfunction pills and other unlicensed medicines on the black market are risking their health, a doctor is warning, after millions of doses were seized. Figures obtained by the BBC show more than 57 million doses of unauthorised medication have been confiscated in the UK by government agencies in the last five years.Julian Spinks, a GP in Medway, Kent, said there was a risk of buying a dummy pill, a completely different medication or the correct drug at the wrong dose.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: \"Products purchased in this way will not meet our strict quality and safety standards, and taking such medicines may put your health at risk.\"Missed health checksThe seizures between 2020/21 and 2024/25 also included unlicensed painkillers, anti-anxiety medication and sleeping tablets.More than 34 million doses were seized in the two most recent years, according to data released in a Freedom of Information request to the MHRA.In the last year, unlicensed drugs for erectile dysfunction were the most common item seized.Dr Spinks said he was not surprised some patients were buying the drugs online.\"A lot of them are very embarrassed and don't want to talk to their doctor about it,\" he said.\"However, they are missing out on the additional checks doctors do to make sure they can take it safely and to look for underlying causes.\"There's a good chance they're buying a dummy pill and they are wasting their money.\"GP Julian Spinks says there is no way of knowing the dose of illegally traded medicineThe MHRA said the second most common medicine seized in the last financial year was the painkiller Tramadol.Dr Spinks told the BBC there was an increasing reluctance in the NHS to prescribe the opiate because there were \"more risks than benefits to long-term use\".\"This drug does cause tolerance and addiction,\" he said.\"There can be considerable variation in the strength of the drugs, so there is a much bigger danger of overdose.\"Masking symptomsAnother major concern is that these medicines can mask symptoms without treating the underlying problem, according to Surrey doctor David Triska.He said: \"Someone may feel temporary relief from pain, anxiety or insomnia, but the root cause remains unaddressed.\"Dr Triska, who is a GP in Witley, said this could delay proper assessment and treatment and, in some cases, allowed serious conditions to worsen before help was finally sought.\"From a clinical point of view, we often end up seeing people later and sicker than we otherwise would,\" he said.\"There is also a widespread misconception that if something is easy to buy online, it must be safe.\"Kim Webster's 17-year-old son William Horley died in 2018 after taking Tramadol recreationally with a friend.\"It just breaks my heart still,\" she said. \"Life is just so precious and being that person that's living through my son dying from drugs bought online, things need to change.\"You can get them [Tramadol] prescribed from a doctor. Why are they getting these online?\"Ms Webster, from Herne Bay, has since given awareness talks to tens of thousands of pupils on behalf of the Kenward Trust, a Kent-based charity.She said: \"I'm shocked at the age they actually know about [drugs]. There are some children so switched on with what is out there and how to use things and how to get them, it's so scary.\"Kim WebsterKim has campaigned about drugs awareness since her son William Horley died aged 17 The MHRA seizes drugs which are counterfeit, sold illegally without a prescription, or genuine medicines which do not have a licence for use in the UK.The government agency said the biggest challenge was from medicines that were unlicensed or unapproved for use in the UK, which were often smuggled into the country across borders.\"Buying any medicine from unauthorised suppliers significantly increases the risk of getting a product which is either falsified or not licensed for use in the UK,\" said Andy Morling, MHRA's deputy director of criminal enforcement.\"We will continue to work closely with law enforcement agencies, international partners and others to prevent the illegal supply of medicines and to protect patients.\"The government recently launched a new awareness campaign about the risks of taking drugs, including the use of counterfeit medicines.

Residents speak of their pain but also of their resolve to support one another and the families affected.The contrast is as stark as the wind driving snow into the faces of rescuers - wrapped-up families carrying buckets and spades heading to the beach to build snowmen, as weary coastguard officials in blue overalls and hi-vis jackets search for a missing person.On Friday, two people died after being pulled from the water at Withernsea - a town with a population of just 6,500.The victims were 67-year-old Mark Ratcliffe, who died trying to save the others, and 45-year-old Sarah Keeling.Her daughter, Grace Keeling,15, remains missing, although HM Coastguard confirmed the sea search for them was called off at 16:00 GMT on Saturday.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCFamilies trudge through snow on Withernsea's promenade From our vantage point next to the castellated entrance to a former pier, which was destroyed by storms and ship collisions in the late 19th Century, the Reverend Clive Hall, from the town's St Matthew's Church, also spots the families on the promenade. \"Withernsea is a fun place,\" he says.\"It's a place people come to enjoy themselves, even in winter. It's a lot smaller and quieter than Bridlington further up the coast.\"We are very close-knit here. But now we have tears and heartbreak. The mood is sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCThe tragedy is said to have happened near to The Towers, a local landmark in WithernseaMr Hall tells me how the town's five churches have come together, with clergy converging on Withernsea Methodist Church, which has become the focus for prayers.On Sunday, services reflected the town's loss.\"People are already talking about a special service. That will be something to consider at a later point,\" Mr Hall says.Angie Smith, 51, from Hull, is walking with her family. She too associates Withernsea with happy memories.\"It's always been a happy little seaside town,\" she says.\"What an awful start to the year this is.\"Like us, those people [those who died] will have gone to the seaside for a walk and then this happened.Kevin Shoesmith/BBCCoastguard officials search the beach in a snowstorm for the missing person Darrin Stevens' photographs showing the initial search and rescue efforts have been  widely published.Now, he stands - without a camera - on the promenade, reflecting on events, as a woman lays a bouquet of flowers. \"The balcony of my home overlooks the sea,\" he says, pointing to it.\"Within minutes, all I could see was a wall of flashing blue lights.\"Mr Stevens did not see anyone in the water, with the seawall saving him from witnessing the tragedy.Like Mr Hall, he describes a town that supports each other.\"So many people came down on to the promenade on Friday evening,\" he says.\"They weren't there taking pictures for social media; they were there to show support.\"My neighbours brought coffees and teas for the rescuers. People just wanted to help in any way they could. It was remarkable for all the wrong reasons.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCWithernsea-based photographer Darrin Stevens captured the initial emergency response to the tragedyJason Catlin, 45, who lives opposite the town's RNLI station, agrees with those sentiments.\"Even though something like this does not directly affect everyone, everyone feels it,\" he says.\"It feels really sombre.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJason Catlin says the town \"feels sombre\"Friends David Lewis, 69, and Neil Finn, 63, know this stretch of coastline well, and they tell of the dangers.Gesturing to the road that runs parallel to the promenade, a good distance from the sea, Mr Lewis says: \"I used to be a road sweep for the council and I'd often find pebbles and wood, thrown up by the sea, scattered all along here after a storm.\" Mr Finn adds: \"I've seen the sea come up over the towers before.\"The sea can be very dangerous.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCNeil Finn and David Lewis say the sea can be perilous even to those walking on the promenadeDownload the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesA national day of mourning has been announced in Switzerland for 9 JanuaryThe bodies of the 40 victims of a bar fire in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve have been identified by police.The victims range in age from 14 to 39 years old, with 15 aged under 18. The youngest were a Swiss girl and a French boy, both 14. The group includes people of Swiss, Italian, Romanian, Turkish, Portuguese, French, and Belgian nationalities, as well as a citizen of the UK, France and Israel.In addition to the 40 killed, 119 others were injured. Most have severe burns - six of them so severe that they have yet to be identified. A criminal investigation into the French couple who managed Le Constellation bar is under way. Sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling are the likely cause of the fire, a preliminary investigation has found.Police said no further details will be released about the victims they had identified out of respect for their relatives.However, Arthur Brodard's mother took to Facebook on Saturday night to announce her is 16-year-old son, Arthur, was one of the dead. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light,\" she said as she appeared visibly upset in a video message. He \"has left to party in paradise\", she said.While Arthur was still presumed missing and information on his whereabouts was scarce, Ms Brodard-Sitre told local newspaper Le Temps that she had been \"living a nightmare\".Some of his friends had been found with burns covering nearly half their bodies, she told the newspaper. \"There are no words - they went through hell.\"Laetitia Brodard-Sitre/FacebookArthur Brodard's mother posted a moving tribute to her sonLe Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.SUPPLIEDVideo from inside the bar appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fireThe French couple who own the bar - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office for the Valais region said.Beatrice Pilloud, Valais canton lead prosecutor, said in a statement that investigators were looking into whether the acoustic foam on the venue's ceiling was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".A teenager who went to two schools in the UK has been confirmed as one of the victims killed in the fire. Charlotte Niddam, who was believed to be 15, previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire and the Jewish Free School in north-west London, according to reports.In a post on social media, the teenager's family announced her death \"with great sadness\" and said details of her funeral arrangements would be made in due course. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper also confirmed the news in a post on X.Italian media named junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini, 16, as the first identified victim of the fire following a statement from the Italian Golf Federation paying tribute to the \"young athlete who carried with him passion and authentic values\".His father is quoted as saying his son was at Le Constellation. A spokesperson for the Italian foreign ministry previously told the BBC it would not confirm the death.",

    "body": "Former Australia batter Damien Martyn has woken up from an induced coma and is making a \"miraculous\" recovery after he was diagnosed with meningitis just over a week ago.The 54-year-old, who played 67 Test matches between 1992 and 2006, fell ill late last month and was admitted to a Queensland hospital on 27 December.In a statement on behalf of Martyn's family, close friend and former Australia teammate Adam Gilchrist said on Sunday: \"It's been an unbelievable turn of events in the last 48 hours.\"\"[Martyn] has responded extraordinarily well since coming out of the coma to the point where his family feels it's like some sort of miracle,\" the statement said, adding \"he is now able to talk\".Gilchrist, a former wicketkeeper, said Martyn's condition was \"so positive\" that medical staff were hopeful he may move out of the intensive care unit, which showed \"what a great recovery it's been and how quickly it has flipped around\".Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It can come on suddenly and kill within hours if not treated quickly. Gilchrist and Martyn's family also thanked the staff at the Gold Coast University Hospital \"who have been nothing short of amazing throughout this challenging time\".\"He will remain in hospital and continue to receive treatment but the turnaround has been miraculous\".Martyn is in \"good spirits and overwhelmed by the support,\" the statement continued, with his wife Amanda adding that the \"love, goodwill and sense of care\" from his supporters has helped in his recovery.Martyn, who made his Test debut at the age of 21, played in four Ashes series and during his career scored 4,406 Test runs at an average of 46.37. He won two World Cups with Australia and retired before the Third Test of the 2006-07 series.During the 2003 World Cup final, Martyn - batting with a broken finger - scored an unbeaten 88 as Australia defeated India.Martyn was also a prolific one-day international batter, scoring 5,346 runs from 208 matches at an average of 40, with five hundreds and 37 fifties.He also represented Yorkshire as an overseas player in 2003.",

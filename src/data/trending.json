Carol, Breaking Up Is Hard To Do, Bad Blood, Laughter in the Rain and Calendar Girl, has died at the age of 86.\"Our family is devastated by the sudden passing of our beloved husband, father and grandfather,\" his family confirmed in a statement.  \"A true rock and roll legend, an inspiration to millions, but most importantly, at least to those of us who were lucky enough to know him, an incredible human being who will be deeply missed.\"Sedaka, a skilled pianist nominated for five Grammy awards, also wrote hits for several other famous musicians in his six-decades-long career. His family did not disclose his cause of death or where he died.The Brooklyn native and student of the famed Julliard School in New York was a founder of the doo-wop group The Tokens in the late 1950s. After producing several hits through the early 1960s, he later returned to Billboard's Top 10 chart in 1975 after writing the song Love Will Keep Us Together for duo Captain & Tennille. He also recorded several albums for Elton John's record label in the 1970s.He wrote his first hit song with his neighbour while still a teenager. Connie Francis recorded and released \"Stupid Cupid\" in 1958. Sedaka's popular music faded from the spotlight later in the 1960s, as the British Invasion era took hold of the US.\"It's wonderful for the soul to be able to play classical music,\" he said.\"But to travel around, playing your own lyrics and music is a very rewarding feeling and I chose that, and I have no regrets.\"",

    "body": "First writing may be 40,000 years earlier than thought2 days agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterUniversity of Tübingen / Hildegard JensenA 40,000-year-old mammoth figurine with engraved rows of crosses and dotsThe history of writing down thoughts and feelings could be tens of thousands of years older than previously believed, surprising archaeologists who made the discovery.The researchers discerned patterns of meaning in lines, notches, dots, and crosses on objects like mammoth tusks as old as 45,000 years in caves in Germany.Traditionally historians date the first written words to proto-cuneiform scripts made around 5,000 years ago in ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia.The precise meaning of the symbols in Germany remains a mystery.The objects are from just before Homo sapiens moved to Europe from Africa where they interacted with Neanderthals.Until now it was thought that writing developed in Mesopotamia around 3,000 BCE, followed by hieroglyphics in Egypt and later in China and Mesoamerica.\"The Stone Age sign sequences are an early alternative to writing,\" says Prof Christian Bentz from Saarland University, an author of the new research.The work suggests that Stone Age people were as clever as modern-day humans, according to researcher Ewa Dutkiewicz from Berlin's Museum of Prehistory and Early History.\"So far, we've only scratched the surface of what can be found in terms of symbol sequences on a wide variety of artifacts,\" she says.The team analysed more than 3,000 characters on 260 objects to uncover what they call the DNA of writing.Some of the objects are from a 37-km long cave system called the Lonetal in Baden-Württemberg, southern Germany.Landesmuseum Württemberg / Hendrik ZwietaschThe so-called \"adorant\" has a human-like figure and several rows of notches and dots. On a small mammoth carved from tusk, the researchers analysed carefully engraved rows of crosses and dots.And on an artefact called \"adorant\" from the Geißenklösterle cave in the Achtal valley, they identified rows of dots and notches on an ivory plaque showing a lion-human creature.They believe the arrangement of the marks, in particular the dots on the back, show the patterns acted as communication.The researchers believe that Stone Age people deliberately carved these symbols to communicate messages, meaning, and convey thoughts.Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Vorderasiatisches Museum / Olaf M. TesmerA proto-cuneiform tablet from around 3350 years ago \"Our results also show that the hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic era developed a symbol system with a statistically comparable information density to the earliest proto-cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia – a full 40,000 years later,\" says Bentz.The clue to finding meaning is in the density of the symbols. They found high repetition of the signs and predictability in the subsequent symbols that is \"comparable to much later proto-cuneiform,\" according to Bentz.They found denser patterns on figurines than on tools.The team say that it shows that communicating information was very important for Paleolithic people.\"They were skilled craftspeople. You can tell they carried the objects with them. Many of them fit very well in the hand, just the right size to fit in the palm,\" says Dutkiewicz.The research is published in the journal PNAS.",

    "body": "Across the UK, the Worm Moon is at its fullest on Tuesday 3 March at 11:38 GMT during the day.However it will appear full overnight on both Monday and Tuesday.It tends to look its most impressive when closest to the horizon at moonrise which occurs at different times across the UK, including:17:42 in London17:44 in Edinburgh17:48 in Cardiff17:50 in BelfastLook to the east in the early evening sky.For some parts of the world, the full Moon will be visible as it undergoes a total lunar eclipse, becoming what is known as a Blood Moon.A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth moves directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a shadow onto the Moon's surface. During this, the Moon can turn a rusty red colour, which is where it gets it nickname, the Blood Moon.Those most likely to see the phenomenon include observers in parts of North America, South America, East Asia, and Australia.The UK, however, will sadly miss out as the Moon will be below the horizon whilst the shadow is being cast.",

    "body": "Inside Iran, panic as strikes hit but for some it's a moment of relief41 minutes agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsGetty ImagesMany residents have begun heading north from TehranVideos circulating on social media show people near the blast sites running in panic, with the sounds of screams and crying in the background.But, says BBC Persian, at the same time there appears to be a sense of relief - even celebration - among those who believe the regime's downfall can only come through military intervention.In one video, a woman speaks with unmistakable relief, saying Ayatollah Khamenei's residence has been hit. Another clip shows teenagers at a school dancing and chanting that the strikes have happened, adding, \"I love Trump.\"Many people had been anticipating a possible US attack. Since Friday night, long queues have formed at petrol stations, and many residents of the capital, Tehran, have begun leaving the city for the north, near the Caspian Sea, which they believe is safer.With Iran coming under an almost total internet blackout since the attacks started, it has been difficult to contact anyone inside the country. Some people briefly managed to access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks, and may be able to do so again.Getty ImagesPeople in Iran are trying to find out news of the attacks amid an internet blackoutThe BBC has, however, been able to reach a number of pro-regime figures who spoke about the situation in Tehran.\"We have heard lots of explosions. I live in middle of Tehran,\" one of them told BBC Newshour. \"This was a normal day until the United States and Israel started attacking the city. Our children have gone to a school in the morning. We had to go and get the children.\"Another told the BBC Weekend programme he heard fighter jets and two explosions early in the morning from his office in the north of the city. The atmosphere was tense and there was a sense of war in the air.He said that people were shopping and stocking up on canned food.One resident told BBC Persian via Starlink there was a heavy security presence on streets leading to the compound of the Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.'Look after our children'Before the blackout, some people posted messages on social media in case they were killed in air strikes.\"If I die, don't forget that we exist too - those of us who oppose any military attack, those of us who will become just a number in reports of the dead,\" one Iranian wrote on social media.Another wrote: \"Damn the Islamic dictatorship that caused this war. We have already endured three wars.\"Some posts highlight the strain of communication and fear for children caught in the conflict: \"The internet is almost down... If the network is completely cut, know that we are not soldiers for any leader, nor collateral damage,\" said another user. \"We are human and have the right to live. Try to make our future democratic, not dependent on individuals.\"Another user wrote: \"Promise that if anything happens to us, you will look after our children and be very, very kind to them. Tell them we did everything we could - we joined silent marches, we voted, we worked multiple shifts, we endured great hardship.\"Others, however, fear that air strikes alone may not bring about the regime's collapse. They worry it could survive and, in response, become even more brutal towards its own people.At the time of protests more than a month ago in which thousands were killed, US President Donald Trump had encouraged Iranians to continue protesting, vowing that help was on the way. Now, some Iranians report receiving text messages reading, \"Help has come\" - urging people to stay at home and calling on regime forces to lay down their arms.But public sentiment could shift sharply if civilians are killed in the strikes, with many Iranians reacting with anger after state media reported that an Israeli strike on a girls' school killed dozens of people. There is no confirmation.An Iranian living abroad who opposes military intervention in Iran commented: \"The first victims of this war are 40 girls in Minab, hit by a missile attack. Is this the war you cheer for?\"Deep mistrust of the Iranian regime, however, makes official reports difficult for many to accept, and some Iranians directly blamed the regime for the attack.One user wrote: \"Even if the regime did not directly target schools, the deaths of children in Minab remain the responsibility of the Islamic Republic. \"People have no shelters, the internet is cut, phone lines are down, and there has been no warning to keep children out of school. In these conditions, the minimum requirement should be to stay at home.\"",

    "body": "Iran says it has hit US base in Bahrain, as it launches strikes across region3 hours agoTom BennettReutersPlumes of black smoke were seen rising above an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth FleetIranian forces say they have struck a US naval base in Bahrain, as Iran launched strikes across the region in retaliation for a \"massive\" and ongoing attack against it by the US and Israel.Huge plumes of black smoke were seen rising from an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. The extent of any damage is unclear and the US has not commented. Elsewhere across the region, the UAE, Qatar, Jordan and Kuwait - all home to US military bases - said they have intercepted missiles fired towards them.  In Doha, Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted several missiles apparently targeting the al-Udeid air base, the largest US base in the region.The US has about 13 military bases across the Middle East, with 30,000 to 40,000 troops normally deployed between them. Authorities in Bahrain confirmed the attack on the US naval base, known officially as Naval Support Activity Bahrain. It is the home port for ships including anti-mine vessels and logistical support ships, though it is unclear if any were present. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it was targeting US bases and assets as part of operation \"Truthful Promise 4\", in retaliation for the attack on Iran launched by the US and Israel on Saturday morning. That attack - launched at approximately 09:30 Tehran time (06:00 GMT) - has so far targeted areas linked to the Iranian leadership, with US President Donald Trump encouraging the Iranian people to rise up against the regime. In Israel, sirens have been activated across the country throughout Saturday - with its military saying numerous rounds of missiles had been launched at it by Iran, and that its air force is working to intercept them. In neighbouring Jordan, the armed forces said they had shot down two ballistic missiles targeting its territory, with authorities saying there were no casualties. The defence ministry of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said in a statement that the country has been subjected to a \"a blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\".\"UAE air defence systems dealt with the missiles with high efficiency and successfully intercepted a number of missiles,\" it added. It said debris fell on a residential area in Abu Dhabi, causing some material damage and killing a civilian. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the attack by the US and Israel as \"wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate\", and said Iran's armed forces \"are prepared for this day and will teach the aggressors the lesson they deserve\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentPA MediaShabana Mahmood visited a removals centre in Denmark this week to examine how its policies workHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood is to press ahead with reforms to the asylum and immigration system, despite the loss of a once-safe Labour seat to the Greens in the Gorton and Denton by-election.The Green Party has criticised Labour's stance on immigration – with its leader Zack Polanski recently accusing the party of echoing \"the racist rhetoric of the far right\". The Greens have also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work.Following their victory on Thursday, some Labour MPs have warned ministers not to try to \"out-Reform Reform [UK]\".But a source close to Mahmood told the BBC that the government should not learn the wrong lessons from the result - and that it was \"wrong\" to assume Muslim voters were deserting Labour over immigration. Left-wing Labour MPs are now calling for a change of approach.Richard Burgon – of the Socialist Campaign Group – told the BBC it was time to \"ditch the approach of aping Reform and kicking the left which has alienated so many people who have voted Labour previously\".Apsana Begum said a number of factors including immigration had played into the \"catastrophic result\" for Labour, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Someone has to take responsibility.\"If some in Labour are now queasy about the home secretary's approach, sources are suggesting that the alternative was the \"far right raising up the drawbridge\" and putting in jeopardy the future of the asylum system - and even of the Labour Party itself.Mahmood herself has said that illegal immigration was putting immense strain on the country and undermining the contract between the government and its citizens.Mahmood visited reception and removal centres for asylum seekers near Copenhagen, the Danish capital, this week, to examine how a tougher set of policies was working in practice. Danish government policies influenced Labour's proposals for asylum reform aimed at reducing incentives for people to enter the UK illegally, and the home secretary is expected to begin implementing some of them from next week.These include making most migrants wait for up to 10 years - rather than the current five – before being able to apply for permanent residence, with refugees waiting for up to 20 years. The proposals also included offering only temporary protection to those whose asylum claims have been accepted - and reducing the number of appeals that unsuccessful applicants can lodge. This is not as far as Reform UK has said it is willing to go.Its home affairs spokesman Zia Yusuf said Mahmood was \"all talk and no action\", and that the government could not fix the immigration system while it was \"chained\" to the European Convention on Human Rights (EHCR).He said a Reform government would leave the ECHR immediately and \"completely abolish indefinite leave to remain\", as well as imposing visa bans on countries refusing returns and \"criminalise aiding illegal entry, regardless of intent\". Mahmood is expected to double down on her approach in a speech next week.She will seek to make a \"Labour case\" for \"firm and fair\" Danish-style immigration policies.Imran Hussain, from the Refugee Council, a charity, was sceptical about proceeding with new asylum and immigration rules.He said that \"the big lesson of recent years was that tough talking\" did not lead to \"smart action\" and the government should instead focus on the \"basics\" - swifter asylum decisions, swifter appeals and help for refugees to integrate.",

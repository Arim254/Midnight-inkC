Serious offences including murder, robbery and rape will still go before a jury. Lammy has said the reforms were “bold” but “necessary”. Adam is joined by home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.\nAnd, amidst all the noise around last week’s budget you may have missed the Prime Ministers suggestion that he will accept all the recomendations made in a report that criticised the UK’s nuclear power industry as expensive and “overly complex”. \nThe man who wrote it, John Fingleton tells Adam about what he found and what he thinks it tells us about the UK’s approach to regulation. \nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

    "body": "Trans girls can no longer join Girlguiding, organisation says9 hours agoJames MelleySenior Social Affair ProducerAlamyGirlguiding is responsible for youth girl groups including Brownies and GuidesThe organisation that oversees girl guide groups in the UK has announced it is banning trans girls from joining.Girlguiding said the move – which means it will not accept biological boys who identify as girls - was in response to the Supreme Court ruling earlier this year that said sex meant biological sex in equality law.The trustees said they had made the \"difficult decision\" with a \"heavy heart\" and there would be further announcements on what this will mean for current members.Trans rights organisation TransActual said: \"There is no problem being solved here, only harm being done.\" Women's rights charity Sex Matters said Girlguiding had done the \"right thing\" in making the change. Around 385,000 girls and young women between the ages of four and 18 take part in Rainbows, Brownies, Guides and Rangers groups around the UK.Girlguiding said: \"From today (2 December) trans girls and young women, and others not recorded female at birth, will no longer be able to join Girlguiding as new young members.\"Girlguiding said there would be no immediate changes for young members, but more information would be shared next week. It is not clear how many people the rule change will directly affect, as the organisation says it does not collect data on gender identity.\"This is a decision we would have preferred not to make, and we know that this may be upsetting for members of our community,\" the trustees said. \"Girlguiding believes strongly in inclusion, and we will continue to support young people and adults in marginalised groups.\"In UK law, the 2010 Equality Act sets out the rules for single sex organisations and spaces being able to exclude members of the opposite sex.In April, the Supreme Court ruled that this meant biological sex, meaning, for example, that a trans man could be excluded from a service set up for men.Draft guidelines on how to interpret the law by the equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), were presented to the government for consideration in September. A leaked copy was reported on last week, but it has not been officially published.Girlguiding said it has made its decision following consultation with members and legal advice. It will now allow only biologically female members to join.It said: \"Girlguiding's governing charity documents set out that the membership and people who benefit from our organisation are girls and women.\"The organisation was reportedly facing legal action from a parent who felt it was failing to follow the law.Biological girls who identify as boys are still able to join. The organisation also said most adult roles were already open to all and it was \"confident that no volunteers will have to leave\". Other adult roles are already designated specifically as female roles.Reacting to the decision, Sex Matter's CEO Maya Forstater said Girlguiding had done the \"right and only thing for it to do\".\"Both girls and boys deserve to have opportunities for adventure and learning, and Girlguiding provides an organisation that is just for girls.\"Tammy Hymas, from trans rights campaigners TransActual, said: \"It's awful that an organisation, which would happily be inclusive and has been for many years, is being forced to exclude young trans girls\".",

    "body": "A young turtle from a Canadian children's book series is caught in an international feud after the US Defence Department used the character in a cartoon about killing alleged drug traffickers.The publisher of \"Franklin the Turtle\" books is criticising Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth for a social media post depicting the beloved children's character shooting the alleged criminals.\"We strongly condemn any denigrating, violent, or unauthorized use of Franklin's name or image\", publisher Kids Can Press said. The publisher is not alone. Sabrina Carpenter lashed out at the White House on Tuesday for using her song in a video about deporting migrants, saying it was \"evil and disgusting\".\"Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda,\" the singer posted.The White House used the pop star's music in a 1 December social media post showing a compilation of ICE operations and captioned it was a lyric from her song Juno. In Franklin's case, the cartoon posted by Hegseth on social media is a mock book cover depicting Franklin in a military helicopter firing a large weapon at alleged drug boats. The faux title reads: \"Franklin Targets Narco Terrorists.\"The image comes amid a string of US strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats since early September. The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by attacking boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.Hegseth captioned the post: \"For your Christmas wish list...\"Franklin, the 6-year-old cartoon turtle, is known for navigating everyday challenges, from learning to ride a bike to having his first sleepover.He originated as the titular character in the Canadian children's book \"Franklin the Turtle\" and has grown to star in a number of television shows, films, video games and live productions.\"Franklin the Turtle is a beloved Canadian icon who has inspired generations of children and stands for kindness, empathy, and inclusivity,\" publisher Kids Can Press said in its statement, adding that such a violent depiction \"directly contradicts these values\".Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement on Monday night that \"We doubt Franklin the Turtle wants to be inclusive of drug cartels... or laud the kindness and empathy of narco-terrorists\".The artists credited with creating Franklin and authoring his books did not respond to requests from the BBC for comment.In September, Pokémon said it did not give permission for the use of its theme song and other footage to be used in an ICE deportation raid video posted by the US government.British singer Jess Glynne also criticised White House officials in July after they used a viral Jet2holiday advert featuring her song in a video promoting deportations.",

The egg opens up to reveal a tiny basket of white quartz flowers inside. The Fabergé house only ever made 50 eggs for Russia's imperial Romanov family, and the Imperial Winter Egg is one of just seven left in private hands. The others are either missing or owned by institutions or museums.The eggs were made from 1885 until Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate in 1917.",

    "body": "3 hours ago\"No justice\" exclaims the Daily Mirror after a report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster was published, which it says leaves \"police shame\". Not one officer of 12 that could have faced gross misconduct charges over the stadium crush that killed 97 will do so as they have all retired, it writes. The Mirror is also among several papers to feature a photo of television presenter Holly Willoughby on its front page after she pleaded guilty to \"driving without care\" and was fined £1,653.The i Paper echoes the Mirror with a headline reading \"Still no justice\", after 36 years of investigations. It features photographs of all 97 victims of the disaster in a grid,  saying lives were lost after \"failures\" on the day - citing the latest inquiry's findings.The Guardian quotes families of those that died in the Hillsborourgh disaster as saying that it is \"a bitter injustice\" that no officers will face proceedings. Also on the front page, the Guardian reports Vladimir Putin made \"hard-edged remarks\" before meeting US officials for talks over the Ukraine war by saying that \"Russia does not intend to fight Europe, but if Europe starts, we are ready right now\". The paper also highlights criticism from MPs that the handling of the China spy case was \"shambolic\".A photo of Sarah Everard, who was abducted, raped and murdered by police officer Wayne Couzens in 2021, is splashed across the front page of the Daily Express. Her mother has spoken at an inquiry into her death as a new report warns \"more lives are at risk\" from violent sexual attacks on women and girls. There is \"no better time to act\", the Express adds, quoting the report.A warning from economists of \"low growth and higher bills\" leads the Times. The paper also features a photo of Sarah Everard as her mother says she continues to suffer \"sadness, rage and guilt\" more than four years after her murder.Sarah Everard's mother is \"still tormented by the horrors\" of her daughter's final hours, writes the Independent. The chair of the inquiry into her death is quoted by the paper as saying it is \"shocking\" that her police vetting recommendations are yet to be fully implemented after nearly two years.Metro headlines on Justice Secretary David Lammy's decision to end jury trials for thousands with a headline reading \"the jury's out\". MPs \"from all sides\" have \"railed\" against the call according to Metro, which Lammy made to cut a backlog of 80,000 cases.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has told party donors that he expects a \"deal or merger\" with the Conservatives before the next election, according to the Financial Times. This \"suggests he believes he cannot sweep to power alone\", it writes. In Russia, US special envoy Steve Witkoff has been in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The discussions, at a large white table, are shown on the FT's front.The Daily Telegraph continues to focus on questions over whether the chancellor may have misled the public over the state of the UK's finances before the Budget. It reports senior figures at the Office for Budget Responsibility said Treasury permanent secretary James Bowler - the department's top civil servant - approved the publication of a letter showing the chancellor knew \"the financial hole was smaller than previously thought\".Royal rents are \"under fire\" as \"cut-price\", writes the Daily Mail. Following the scandal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's peppercorn rent of Royal Lodge, now MPs will \"scrutinise deals enjoyed by Sophie, Edward and Princess Alexandra\", it reports.The Daily Star focuses on the Holly Willoughby court case. The paper reports the TV presenter collided with man on a scooter near her home in London, who was knocked to the ground and sustained a fracture to his neck.For the Sun, it is the \"great game robbery\" as it says tickets at the World Cup in the US, Canada and Mexico next year will be \"the most expensive ever seen\". Fifa has \"grabbed\" a share of the resale market and tickets are already going for £1,000, it reports. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJosh MartinandOsmond ChiaAirbus has confirmed an unspecified number of its aircraft will undergo inspections after a \"supplier quality issue\" with metal panels used on some A320 planes was identified.The problem, which the firm said impacts a \"limited number\" of planes, comes days after thousands of the same model were grounded for an urgent software update.On Tuesday, the European manufacturer said it was taking a \"conservative approach\" by checking all planes that could be affected, even though not all are expected to need repairs.The company told AFP news agency around 600 A320s, a model widely used by major airlines, could be impacted. Airbus did not confirm the number in its response to the BBC.\"The source of the issue has been identified, contained and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements,\" Airbus's spokesperson told the BBC.A statement continued: \"Only inspections will determine where an aircraft may have panels with quality issues and the appropriate action to be taken.\"AFP reported Airbus as saying the number of planes that needed to be checked was \"reducing day by day as inspections progress to identify those needing a specific action to be taken\".The BBC has contacted major airlines that use the A320, including British Airways, American Airlines, Korean Air, Lufthansa Airlines and Delta for comment.Earlier this week, thousands of Airbus planes were grounded for a software update after it was discovered that intense solar radiation could interfere with onboard flight control computers.That issue was discovered after a plane travelling between the US and Mexico suddenly lost altitude as a result of the vulnerability, injuring 15.More than 6,000 Airbus aircraft needed emergency computer updates in one of the largest ever aviation industry recalls.It resulted in global disruption and flight cancellations over the final weekend of November, a busy time of the year for travel - particularly in the US, where it coincided with Thanksgiving. Airbus shares have fallen by more than 6.5% in the past five days.",

    "body": "7 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonReutersSarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, while the other officer Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains in hospitalProsecutors officially filed murder charges against the suspected shooter accused of killing one National Guard soldier and injuring another in Washington DC last Wednesday.According to a criminal complaint, Rahmanullah Lakanwal shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" as he fired and was reloading after a Guard member shot and wounded him.  Lakanwal, who came to the US from Afghanistan in 2021, pleaded not guilty during a virtual court appearance from a hospital bed, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. Charges against him include first-degree murder and assault with intent to kill.The Trump administration paused all asylum decisions following the shooting and ordered a review of Afghan refugees in the US.National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries, while the other officer Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured and remains in hospital. Both were on assignment in the US capital from West Virginia. The charging complaint, which includes photos from security-camera footage, lays out what prosecutors say happened last Wednesday near an underground train station while Beckstrom and Wolfe were on patrol with other National Guard troops. The pair were dressed in military uniforms a few blocks from the White House at about 2:15 p.m. talking to two other Guard members when gunfire erupted. A supervisor heard gunshots and saw Wolfe and Beckstrom collapse. He \"immediately pulled his service weapon and engaged the defendant\", the complaint says.  \"During the subsequent gunfight, the defendant was shot and fell to the ground.\"The supervisor said the shooter stopped firing and was trying to reload when another Guard member jumped on him, and Secret Service officers helped subdue the suspect, the complaint says.Both Wolfe and Beckstrom had been shot in the head and were rushed to hospital.  Beckstrom died the next day. An autopsy found the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of her head and the manner of death \"homicide\".ReutersFile photo: Rahmanullah LakanwalWest Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey on Monday described Wolfe's condition as \"positive\" and said he responded to prompts from a nurse. Morrisey also asked for prayers \"as Andrew fights to survive.\"A judge said the case against Lakanwal was \"exceedingly strong\", according to CBS, and ordered him held without bond.Lakanwal worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and fled to the US after the Taliban overthrew the civilian government in 2021. US officials feared people like Lankanwal would be targeted by the Taliban because of their connections to US forces.Officials told CBS his 2024 asylum request was granted earlier this year and he lived in Bellingham, Washington state with his wife and five children. Lakanwal became withdrawn from society and isolated in a room for weeks, according to emails from a social worker last year who said they thought he had mental health illness.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentThe Princess of Wales has sent a Christmas message about the importance of acts of kindness in times that can seem \"fragmented or uncertain\", in a letter to guests attending her carol concert in Westminster Abbey on Friday.\"The time, care and compassion you give, often quietly and unspoken, and without any expectation or recognition, make an extraordinary difference to the lives of others,\" writes Catherine.Alongside members of the Royal Family, the 1,600 guests will include volunteers and people who have helped local communities.Traditional Christmas carols will be sung in the specially decorated Abbey, with readings and music from performers including Hannah Waddingham and Kate Winslet.\"At its heart, Christmas speaks of love taking form in the simplest, most human ways,\" write Catherine in her letter to guests.\"Not in sentimental or grand gestures, but gentle ones. A moment of listening, a word of comfort, a friendly conversation, a helping hand, presence.\"Last month she gave her first public speech in two years, as she gradually recovers after her cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy.While guests are waiting to get inside Westminster Abbey, they will hear music from young people supported by the the Future Talent charity, co-founded by the late Duchess of Kent, who died this autumn.The duchess, who taught music in a state primary school, wanted to provide wider access to music lessons to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.Among the guests will be Anna and Jonathan Cordiner, whose daughter died of a brain tumour, and who set up a charity, Kayleigh's Wee Stars, to support families where a child has a terminal illness.Also attending will be Saphia Turner, aged nine, the winner of the BBC's Make a Difference Young Hero Award, who sells artwork and carries out sponsored challenges to raise money for food banks.\"As the year draws to a close, I hope this season brings you moments of peace and clarity, and that you too, feel surrounded by the same love and care that you offer so freely,\" writes Catherine.Earlier on Tuesday, MPs on the Public Accounts Committee published information about royal leases, including Prince William and Catherine's new home, Forest Lodge in Windsor.It showed they had a 20-year lease with the Crown Estate, with the couple paying a market rent, determined by independent valuers.The public spending watchdog is to hold an inquiry into the Crown Estate and royal property next year, in the wake of questions over Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrangements in Royal Lodge.",

    "body": "Cyclone catastrophe in Sri Lanka awakens volunteer spirit4 hours agoIshara Danasekara,News Editor, BBC News SinhalaandKoh EweWatch: Sri Lankan communities under water after catastrophic floodingSri Lankan actor and musician GK Reginold rides a motorised fishing boat through Colombo's suburbs, hoping to bring food and water to those in desperate need.Some of the families, Mr Reginold says, have not received aid for days, isolated by the South Asian island nation's worst weather disaster in recent years.Cyclone Ditwah lashed the country last week, bringing catastrophic floods and landslides that killed more than 460 people, left hundreds missing and damaged some 30,000 homes.But the deluge has also inspired volunteerism among its people, as they face what their president has described as the \"most challenging natural disaster\" in its history.\"The main reason why I wanted to do this, is to at least help them to have one meal,\" Mr Reginold tells the BBC. \"And I was so happy that I was able to do that.\"BBC SinhalaVolunteers have been taking fishing boats out to rescue flood victims and deliver aidMore than one million people have been affected by the disaster and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency.Sri Lanka's military has deployed helicopters for rescue operations, while humanitarian aid is flowing in from foreign governments and non-governmental organisations.But it will be a long journey to recovery for Sri Lanka, which has seen its fair share of turmoil in recent years.Activists volunteer in community kitchenIn Colombo's Wijerama neighbourhood, activists who protested against former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2022 are now helping run a community kitchen that churns out food aid.The protests from three years ago were fuelled by a spiralling economic crisis that caused shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Public anger exploded and led to Rajapaksa being ousted. Now, that political activism is being channelled to cyclone relief.\"Some volunteers came after work, some took turns and some even took leave to be there,\" Sasindu Sahan Tharaka, a social media activist, tells the BBC.\"We reactivated the group as soon as we heard what was happening last Thursday,\" he says.Sasindu Sahan TharakaAt a community kitchen in Wijerama, volunteers prepare meals for flood-affected residentsMr Sahan also considers the kitchen as an \"extension\" of his volunteer work in 2016, when torrential rain and floods killed 250 people across the country.Volunteers have compiled hundreds of requests for help, sent it to authorities, and organised the distribution of food to residents, Mr Sahan says.\"Whatever we asked for, we got more than enough in response from the community,\" he says.Online campaigns for aidA flurry of activity is also happening online, where social media users have created a public database to direct donations and volunteers.Another volunteer-backed website helps donor find relief camps and what is most needed in those areas.Private companies have organised donation drives, while local television channels have launched an effort to provide food and basic necessities like soap and toothbrushes.Facing criticism over his handling of preparations for Cyclone Ditwah, President Dissanayake has urged Sri Lankans to \"set aside all political differences\" and \"come together to rebuild the nation\".Opposition politicians have accused authorities of ignoring weather warnings, which they say exacerbated the disaster's impact.On Monday, opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in parliament, claiming that the ruling party was trying to limit debate on the disaster.On the ground, however, there remains a sense of unity as Sri Lankans pick up the pieces after the floods.\"In the end, the joy of helping someone else to save lives makes that tiredness fade,\" Mr Sahan wrote in a Facebook post on Monday, after putting in long hours at the community kitchen in Wijerama and other relief sites.\"Disasters are not new to us. But, the empathy and capacity of our hearts is greater than the destruction that occurs during a disaster.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe public inquiry into the Covid pandemic has cost the government more than £100m to respond to so far, the BBC has learnt. This is on top of the £192m spent by the inquiry itself - meaning the cost to the taxpayer is over 50% more than previously thought.The government spending covers legal advice and staffing costs – at last count a team of 248 were working across key departments to produce evidence for the inquiry.Inquiry sources questioned the approach, saying the government has at times been \"hostile and difficult\", blocking the release of information and delivering documents late.But the Cabinet Office said it was committed to the inquiry and learning the lessons for the future.However, the TaxPayers' Alliance has branded it a waste of money and the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said while the work being done was vital, public inquiries generally needed to become more efficient and less adversarial.'Defensive attitude'The scale and cost of the Covid Inquiry has already been questioned by some.It got under way in 2022 and its final report is not expected until 2027. It has already cost £192m – a figure which is expected to rise past £200m by the time it is finished, making it one of the most expensive public inquiries in history.In total there are 10 separate investigations – or modules as they are called. So far only two, looking at pandemic preparedness and government decision-making, have been completed.But analysis of Cabinet Office documents by the BBC has found government departments spent around £101m from April 2023 to June 2025.The bulk of this is thought to have been accrued by five key departments – the Cabinet Office, Home Office, Department of Health and Social Care, Treasury and UK Health Security Agency, which have been repeatedly asked to provide evidence.The costing estimates do not include time officials spend preparing and appearing as witnesses in person.More than half the £101m spend has been on legal fees – including bringing in external lawyers.An inquiry source said that to some extent the spending reflected the defensive attitude of the government towards the inquiry.Inquiry chair Baroness Hallett and the inquiry legal team have criticised government departments for delays providing documents and blocking the release of key information.This most famously came to a head in 2023, when the inquiry and government ended up in the High Court over the government's refusal to release Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages, diaries and notebooks. The government lost the case.Sources said the government had set up a \"huge operation\" which had at times seemed \"hostile and difficult\" to the inquiry.A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"The government is fully committed to supporting the work of the inquiry and to learning lessons from the pandemic to ensure the UK is better prepared for a future pandemic.\"The Cabinet Office argues the court case was brought to gain clarity on a point of principle - the right of an inquiry to request information that the provider considers  irrelevant.'Disgrace'John O'Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance think tank, said: \"It's an absolute disgrace that ministers have burnt through an extra £100m on top of what the inquiry itself has already spent.\"These new figures show the total cost to taxpayers will be far higher than previously feared.\"Ministers must urgently get a grip on the spiralling costs of the Covid Inquiry and commit to delivering answers swiftly and efficiently.\"A spokesman for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said the work of the inquiry was \"vital\" and any costs would be recouped many times over in the future if lessons were learned by reducing the economic impact of the next pandemic as well as saving lives.But he added: \"The inquiry process is far from perfect.\"He said the group supported the Hillsborough Law, which is working its way through parliament and strengthens the legal duty on public authorities to assist public inquiries.He said public inquiries like the Covid one needed to become more efficient and less adversarial.\"Only then can we bring down the cost of future inquiries while protecting access to justice.\"A spokesman for the Covid Inquiry said: \"The inquiry is unlike any previous public inquiry. It was given a very broad scope because it is investigating multiple aspects of a pandemic that affected everyone in society.\"He said the chair had made clear at the start that would take time and have significant cost, but it would result in recommendations that are intended to better protect the UK when the next pandemic strikes.He said the inquiry would not comment on the nature of the relationship with the government.",

Known as the \"workhorse\" of the British Army, the MAN Logistic Support Vehicle is used to deliver food, fuel and other supplies to troops. The fleet was withdrawn from service following a recent exercise named Titan Storm on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, when faults were discovered in the propshaft of some vehicles, which delivers power to the wheels.  All 6,000 vehicles, some of which have been in service for nearly 20 years, are being fitted with replacement parts after some were damaged because they were fitted incorrectly, according to BFBS Forces News.Pollard told MPs: \"It's pretty standard fare, right across our military platforms, for there to be safety notices issued and rectification work taking place.\"He added: \"With the platforms we have, the age of some of them, and the usage for them, there's updates required on a regular basis.\"Pollard was also questioned by MPs about a separate incident on the Titan Storm exercise, which led to the suspension of the Army's Ajax armoured fighting vehicles.About 30 soldiers training to use the Ajax vehicles became unwell because of noise and vibration, with some seen emerging from the vehicles vomiting.Pollard told the committee \"none of them required hospitalisation\" and \"many of them have returned to their normal duties\".But he added: \"I have always been clear that the safety of our people is our top priority, that's why we have paused operations.\"It comes weeks after Pollard claimed the much-delayed £6.3bn Ajax programme had \"left its troubles behind\" and was ready to be deployed with squadrons on operations. Pollard said he had made this statement after receiving written confirmation from the chief of the general staff and the national armaments director saying Ajax was \"demonstrably safe to operate\".He said the Army had launched an investigation into what happened with the Ajax vehicles during the Titan Storm exercise, which he said would be reporting \"very shortly\".The Defence Accident Investigation Branch has also launched an investigation which would take longer to report, Pollard told MPs.And he said he had launched a separate review into the reassurances he had been given by officials about the vehicles' safety.Asked if he had been misled about their operational readiness, he said:  \"Until I see the findings of the preliminary report into what happened, I don't want to make a judgement on the process that led up to it.\"",

    "body": "MPs warn China spy trial failures could happen again3 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash (right) deny the charges against themSystemic failures that led to the collapse of a China spy trial could be repeated without major reforms, a committee of MPs has warned.A report by the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy said \"shambolic\" mismanagement led to prosecutors dropping charges against Chris Cash and Chris Berry, who were accused of passing sensitive material to a Chinese intelligence agent.Both men maintain their innocence.Critics accused the government of deliberately letting the case fail to avoid damaging trade relations with China, but the report found no \"co-ordinated effort\" to bring down the trial.Committee chair Matt Western warned mishandling similar future cases will \"corrode public trust\".Mr Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and China-based academic Mr Berry, were both charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024.Mr Cash worked for two prominent critics of China, the MPs Tom Tugendhat, then chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Alicia Kearns, who later held the same role.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case collapsed after deputy national security adviser (DNSA) Matthew Collins refused to designate China an \"enemy\" at the time of the alleged offences.But the committee of MPs said they were \"surprised\" by the CPS's decision, suggesting it could have been \"put before the jury\".The committee found there was no \"co-ordinated high-level effort\" to collapse or obstruct the trial.Instead, it was beset by \"shambolic\" mismanagement and \"confusion and misaligned expectations\". Communications between the CPS and government were \"inadequate\", and the eight-month delay in obtaining a second witness statement remains unexplained.The report also rejected the government's claim similar trials in the future under the National Security Act 2023 would not collapse. The legislation was brought in under the Tory government to lower the bar in espionage cases  - from aiding an \"enemy\" to offences tied to foreign powers - and covers modern threats like cyber attacks.\"We urge the government to avoid characterising the failure of the Cash/Berry case as a one-off peculiarity created solely by outdated legislation,\" the report said.Western, who is a Labour MP, said: \"As the global security environment worsens, sensitive national security cases will arise more frequently. \"The government must show the public that it is confident in standing up to adversaries when required: failing to do so will corrode public trust in our institutions.\"The report calls for the government to consider bringing in sweeping reforms within six months to prevent a repeat.The role and responsibility of the DNSA - which had been left \"isolated and exposed\" - must be urgently reviewed and overhauled, the report said.Communications between the CPS and the government must also be \"reviewed and improved at pace\".In future trials, every espionage case must convene a formal conference within 30 days of charge. These will bring prosecutors, investigators, government witnesses, and law officers to spot weaknesses in the evidence early.Greater \"clarity\" must be given on whether government witnesses are giving policy details or evidence, the report said.",

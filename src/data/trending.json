    "body": "7 minutes agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterA key witness in the China spying case removed the term \"enemy\" from the final draft of a witness statement submitted to prosecutors, because it did not reflect government policy at the time.In a letter to MPs, deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins said the word \"enemy\" was included in the draft witness statement written when the Conservatives were in power.But he said he told police investigating the case he could not call China an \"enemy\" as this did not reflect government policy\".Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been accused by the Conservatives of allowing the case to collapse earlier this year by not describing China as a threat to national security.The PM's official spokesperson said Collins' letter and evidence by others published today \"underline the position the government has set out repeatedly\".\"The position throughout has been clear that what is relevant in a criminal case of this nature is the government's position at the time of the alleged offences.\"Figures in Downing Street say these documents are proof that there was no political interference from the current government, no minister or special adviser was involved in the evidence, and witness statements could not be shared.These are all things the Conservatives have been arguing to the contrary. The focus now turns on the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in the ongoing row about who was to blame for the collapse of the trial.Charges against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry - who deny the allegations - were dropped in September.Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson, who heads the CPS, said the case fell apart because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.The Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy, which is made up of senior MPs and peers, launched an inquiry last week and has published evidence from Collins and others.It's expected that evidence submitted to Parliament by the Director of Public Prosections will also be published later today.Among those giving evidence at a hearing next week will be Collins, who provided prosecutors with three witness statements - two written while the Conservatives were in power and one under Labour.The three statements were published by the government last week.In his first witness statement, submitted on 22 December 2023, Collins described the UK's policy towards China, as it stood under the then-Tory government.He said China posed an \"epoch-defining challenge\", in language that mirrored government policy at the time, as outlined in the Integrated Review Refresh 2023.Collins - the deputy director of national security (DNSA) - has now submitted evidence in a letter to the committee before appearing in front of MPs.Cash and Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act 1911.Under the legislation, anyone accused of spying can only be prosecuted if the information they passed on was useful to an enemy.In his letter, Collins said Counter Terrorism Police (CTP) requested that he act as a witness in the case in August 2023, including to support the \"enemy\" description needed to mount a prosecution under the 1911 Act.Collins said his legal counsel worked with junior officials to prepare \"a draft text which could form the basis of a witness statement\".He said he reviewed the \"draft wording and amended the statement to ensure factual accuracy and that it was in line with current government policy\".In his letter, Collins wrote: \"These amendments reflected the DNSA's assessment of the evidence provided by operational partners based on his professional experience in advising the prime minister on national security threats, and to accurately represent the government's view of the range of national security threats posed by China.\"Drafts of a statement provided to DNSA included the term 'enemy' but he removed this term from the final draft as it did not reflect government policy.\"Collins said he sent a final version of the draft to the prime minister at the time, Rishi Sunak, and his special advisers.He said at this point, police were told he \"could not call China an 'enemy' as this did not reflect government policy\".Collins said prosecutors were made \"aware of this in December 2023, which was before charges were brought\".He said police asked him to provide two further witness statements, which he submitted in February and August this year.Collins said when police requested the third witness statement, it was \"made clear by CTP that they were only asking for the government's view of the threat from China at the material time that the offences were committed\".Labour's Attorney General Lord Hermer has also submitted evidence to the same committee.In it, he revealed he was informed on 3 September that prosecutors were dropping the case - but was told not to alert other ministers, including the prime minister.Lord Hermer said he received routine updates from the CPS in August indicating the trial was expected to proceed.But during a meeting on 3 September, DPP Parkinson confirmed the decision to drop the case.Lord Hermer said at the DPP's request, he kept the information confidential until police and defendants were informed.The attorney general said \"there is nothing unusual\" in the law officers \"being requested to keep information about individual prosecution decisions confidential even from senior colleagues\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterRetail sales volumes have risen for the fourth month in a row, driven by consumers buying gold online and new tech gadgets. Monthly sales rose by 0.5% in September 2025, new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show, defying an expected decrease of -0.2%. \"Although food stores saw very little growth, good weather in July and August boosted sales of clothing, while online retailing also did well,\" said ONS senior statistician Hannah Finselbach. Tech sales were boosted over the summer by the launch of Nintendo's long-awaited Switch 2 gaming console and Apple's iPhone 17.Within non-store retailing, online jewellers reported strong demand for gold.Between July and September, retail sales were 0.9% higher than the previous three months.The amount spent online between July and September was 3.5% higher than the previous quarter and 5% higher than the same period last year.Retail sales volume are a measure of the quantity of goods sold during a certain period. The figures are a positive sign amid ongoing concerns that the British economy is slowing down.Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis, said consumers were starting to feel a bit more confident about spending.\"Interest rate cuts and above inflation pay increases have meant many workers have had a bit more cash to play with, even if pressures on household budgets have remained high.\"Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the month on month rise in retail sales volumes was better than expected.\"But against a backdrop of weak employment, high inflation and with tax rises on the horizon, we doubt the retail sector will be able to sustain this strength,\" he said.Mr Kerr said that a strong demand for gold jewellery from online retailers could be a result of surging gold prices. Despite this, recent results from the UK's longest-running consumer confidence survey, conducted by GfK, indicate that shoppers are holding back on spending before Black Friday.Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth said that in addition to this, the \"constant background of running commentary on the upcoming budget\" was likely discouraging consumers from discretionary spending.The ONS gathers its figures from all of Great Britain's large retailers and a representative sample of smaller ones. Monthly figures for retail sales are generally more volatile than quarterly.ONS statistics are used in deciding government policy, which affects millions, and are also used by the Bank of England to make key financial decisions, such as setting interest rates.But a recent review of the ONS was highly critical of the agency, calling into question the quality of the economic data it produces.The ONS has struggled, as have many statistical bodies, with tight budgets and with the problem of getting people to fill in the questionnaires needed for their data.",

I saw them juggling work and home. They instilled really strong values in us,\" she added.Kyei hopes to inspire more young people to consider banking as a career.\"You don't need to be a mathematician, you don't need to be an accountant and you don't need to be an economist. What we're looking for is fresh perspectives and we want the best people\".Kyei takes the place of tech CEO Dean Forbes at the head of the list.The rest of the 2026 Powerlist Getty ImagesGetty Images for W Magazine2.

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorKiran Ridley/Getty ImagesThe Louvre attendant described the moment thieves burst into the first-floor galleryA gallery attendant on duty at the Louvre when thieves broke in and stole eight of France's crown jewels has said \"no-one could have been prepared\" for what unfolded as visitors began to arrive on Sunday morning.\"All of a sudden we heard an huge noise,\" she told radio station France Inter, in the first account given by an attendant at the scene.The unnamed attendant and two colleagues initially thought the noise to be an angry visitor, but it was not a normal sound: \"It was a dull, slightly metallic noise.\"It was, in fact, the moment thieves had used an angle grinder to burst through a reinforced window into the Gallery of Apollo, where the Louvre's collection of historic jewelry is kept.Within eight minutes, the gang seized treasures, including a necklace that belonged to Napoleon's wife Empress Marie-Louise and a diadem of Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugenie, worth an estimated total of €88m (£77m).The thieves used a mechanical ladder on the back of a lorry to lift them to a first-floor balcony to gain entry to the gallery.Two tourists ran towards them in panic, she said. \"I saw one of the criminals turn around with something that looked to me like a chainsaw, then I yelled at my colleagues to get out,\" she recalled. She shouted a second time that it was a robbery and that they should run.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOne of her colleagues raised the alarm over a walkie-talkie and then \"we finished evacuating the visits without quite realising really what was going on\". They shut all the doors as they left to protect the neighbouring galleries.On reflection, the attendant said \"for us it was unbelievable the display cases could have been broken... never for a moment did we think there was such a risk... nobody can be prepared for that\".How Louvre gang carried out France's most shocking theftNo camera covered Louvre wall where jewel thieves broke in, director saysLouvre heist lift-maker seizes the moment with new ad campaignAnother Louvre employee came forward to describe the moments after the gang escaped.The anonymous security guard spoke of a very strong smell of petrol as he arrived at the scene outside the Louvre where the gang had parked their lorry.\"I ran outside through the [glass] pyramid and across the courtyard... I got there at the very moment the criminals got away by scooter,\" he told BFMTV.The gang had ruptured the lorry's fuel tank and there was a blowtorch near by, he said. \"It's clear they intended to set fire to their vehicle. I genuinely think we thwarted their plan because they would never have left behind so much evidence.\"\"They even lost one of the pieces they'd meant to steal, because they'd lost [Empress] Eugenie's crown, which they'd just stolen and it had fallen on the ground.\"The security guard and his colleagues were the first to find the crown, he said: \"I can't say I jumped for joy, especially because the piece had obviously been damaged.\"Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe director of the museum, Laurence des Cars, said the empress's crown appeared to have been damaged when the gang prised it out of a narrow gap they had cut in one of the two display cases with an angle grinder.She told French senators this week that initial indications were that \"delicate restoration\" would be possible for the 19th-Century crown inlaid with diamonds and emeralds.Although French ministers insist security at the museum had worked properly on the day, the Louvre director has spoken of years of underfunding and of just one external security camera, facing the wrong way, where the break-in took place.Her damning assessment was backed up by the attendant, who complained that \"for some time we've felt the culture of security is in decline at the museum\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesFBI director Kash Patel described the fraud scheme as \"mind-boggling\"Celebrities, professional sports stars and wealthy gamblers sat at a table hoping to win big in a game of Texas Hold 'Em.But they didn't know it was nearly impossible. They were \"fishes\" allegedly being targeted by the mafia in an elaborate poker gambling scheme that included X-ray card tables, secret cameras, analysers in chip trays and sunglasses and contact lenses that could read their hand. In what sounds like an Ocean's Eleven film plot, prosecutors say these \"unwitting\" victims were cheated out of at least $7m (£5.25m) in poker games - with one person losing at least $1.8m.The scheme, which US prosecutors described as \"reminiscent of a Hollywood movie\", was dismantled in a sprawling federal investigation that led to more than 30 arrests, including members of La Cosa Nostra crime families, Portland Trail Blazers basketball coach Chauncey Billups and former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Damon Jones. FBI director Kash Patel called it a \"mind-boggling\" fraud scheme that cheated victims in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other US cities. Arrests in the scheme were announced on Thursday along with those in an alleged basketball betting plot, in which professional NBA players are accused of faking injuries to influence betting odds. The underground poker scheme started as early as 2019, prosecutors say, and was allegedly operated by the mafia - specifically by members of notorious crime families, including Bonnano, Gambino, Lucchese and Genovese. A cut of the profits, prosecutors say, helped fund their criminal enterprise. Former professional athletes, described by prosecutors as \"face cards\", were enlisted to help in the scheme and entice victims into playing. Lured in by the opportunity to play with a high-profile celebrity - such as Billups or Jones - a wealthy, \"unwitting victim\" would be recruited for illegal, underground poker games where tens of thousands of dollars were on the line, prosecutors allege. Unbeknownst to the lured-in players - referred to in the scheme as a \"fish\" - everyone surrounding them was in on the elaborate scam - from the players to the dealers, even the technology used to shuffle the deck and count the chips, according to a lengthy federal indictment. Sophisticated wireless technology was also used to deceive the players during the games, most commonly in Texas Hold 'Em.What we know about gambling arrestsUS Department of JusticeAn X-ray poker machine was employed to read facedown cards and a rigged card-shuffling machine was also used in the plot, prosecutors sayThe technology was everywhere - an X-ray table that read any face-down card, analysers inside chip trays, a rigged shuffling machine that read cards and predicted who would have the best hand, and pre-marked cards that allowed those wearing special sunglasses and contact lenses to read what was in everyone's hands. Secretive cameras - built into tables and light fixtures - also helped convey information to those helping in the plot, authorities say. Then there was also a sophisticated method of communicating and rigging the game, prosecutors allege. Information from the game would be sent to an off-site conspirator - called an \"operator\" by prosecutors - who then would send information to another player sitting at the table who was in on the scheme - who prosecutors call a \"quarterback\" or \"driver\". That person would then secretly signal to others, prosecutors allege, effectively stealing money and making it impossible for victims to win. Texts from the US justice department's evidence suggest the \"quarterback\" would either touch the $1,000 poker chip, tap his chin, wrist or arm to signal which conspirator had the best hand. If the victim had the best hand, the \"quarterback\" would touch his black chips.The texts also appear to show that at times conspirators agreed to lose some hands in order to keep victims at the gambling table for longer.US Department of JusticeAnother series of texts suggests participants in the scheme avoided suspicion of cheating by swapping in players and losing money to co-conspirators.Authorities estimate that each game would leave a victim out of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.Prosecutors say the defendants allegedly laundered the funds from the scheme through cryptocurrency, cash exchanges and shell companies. A cut of the profits went to those who helped in the plot, prosecutors say, and some allegedly went to fund the mafia's criminal enterprise. \"This alleged scheme wreaked havoc across the nation, exploiting the notoriety of some and the wallets of others to finance the Italian crime families,\" said FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia.Billups, who was accused of being a face card in the fixed card games, was arrested in Portland and was placed on leave by the NBA. The Portland Trail Blazers said in a statement that they were aware of the allegations involving their head coach and were \"fully co-operating with the investigation\".Jones was arrested in relation to both the poker and NBA injuries scheme. He is charged with two counts each of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.",

You have probably already noticed that the nights are drawing in - in fact we are currently losing four or five minutes of daylight every day.However, there's nothing this subtle with the clock change, as sunset leaps forward by an hour in one one go.What time do the clocks go back?The clock change happens at 02:00 BST on Sunday 26 October in the UK. The clocks will go forward again at 01:00 GMT on 29 March 2026, when we return to BST.The easy way to remember which way the clocks change is the phrase \"spring forward, fall back\".In other words, we turn the time forward an hour in spring and back an hour in fall - or autumn.What is Daylight Saving Time?Changes to the clocks have been taking place for well over a century. The first country to make use of Daylight Saving Time (DST) was Germany, in 1916 during World War One.It was intended to maximise evening daylight meaning less heating and lighting was needed, reducing fuel consumption during wartime.Many other countries followed suit just a few weeks later, including the UK where it was named British Summer Time.The time shift has mostly continued ever since, although during a short period in World War Two there was British Double Summer Time, where the clocks went forward by two hours.An experiment between 1968 and 1971 trialled year-round BST and there continue to be some debates about whether the UK should wind its clocks forward permanently.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / Rainbow WatcherImage caption, A permanent switch to BST would mean lighter evenings but darker mornings - especially in winterArguments for keeping the time zone in summer mode include a potential boost in economic productivity as well as a possible reduction in evening road accidents.It would also eliminate the minor disruption caused to sleep patterns by the annual gaining - and losing - of an hour.However, it would also mean some very gloomy winter mornings, especially in Scotland.In Edinburgh and Glasgow the sun does not rise until around 08:45 GMT in the second half of December, which would equate to 09:45 BST.It would leave Scottish commuters and schoolchildren making their winter morning journeys in darkness - bringing increased risks on the roads.Will my clock change automatically?Image source, GettyMost smartphones, digital devices and even modern cars will adjust the time automatically when GMT begins.However analogue clocks will need switching manually, especially important if you are relying on an old-fashioned alarm clock to wake you up.And if you are anything like me the clock on the oven will present a particular challenge.What countries have Daylight Saving Time?We are certainly not alone in switching time zones twice a year.Most of North America and Europe observes Daylight Saving Time, although only small parts of Asia, Oceania, South America and Africa take part.However different countries change their clocks on different dates.For example in the USA the switch takes place on 2 November this year, while in Egypt it happens on 30 October.One benefit of an earlier sunset is that it might be easier to get out and capture it on camera.If you do, feel free to sign up and send your photos to BBC Weather Watchers.Click here to play 'Cooler than me?'",

    "body": "32 minutes agoOsmond Chia,Business reporter, and Maia DaviesGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has announced an immediate end to all trade negotiations with Canada over an advert critical of the tariffs he has imposed on the nation.The advert, sponsored by the government of Canada's province of Ontario, quoted Trump's predecessor, Ronald Reagan, an icon of US conservatism, saying tariffs \"hurt every American\".Trump wrote on social media that the advert was \"FAKE\" and \"egregious\", adding that trade talks were \"HEREBY TERMINATED\".His administration has imposed a 35% levy on many Canadian imports, as well as individual tariffs targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing. Ontario has been particularly hard-hit by these.Trump has allowed exemptions for goods that fall under a free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada that he negotiated during his first term.But Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney has since his election earlier this year attempted to strike a deal that would ease the US tariffs.This has been complicated by Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who is one of the most vocal critics of the taxes levied on US firms buying Canadian products.In the minute-long advert published last week, Reagan's voice can be heard narrating over images that include the New York Stock Exchange and cranes adorned with both US and Canadian flags.The video excerpts a 1987 national radio address by Reagan that focused on foreign trade.\"When someone says, 'let's impose tariffs on foreign imports', it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while it works, but only for a short time,\" Reagan says in the advert.\"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American, worker and consumer.\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars... Markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs.\"The Ronald Reagan Foundation - which is charged with preserving his legacy - released a statement on Thursday saying the advert had used \"selective\" audio and video of the former president's remarks.It said the advert \"misrepresents\" the former president's address, without specifying why, and accused the Ontario government of not seeking permission to use and edit the remarks.The foundation said it was \"reviewing its legal options\".Trump referenced this statement, and said the video was designed to \"interfere with\" the US Supreme Court's upcoming decision in November on whether Washington's sweeping tariffs on many nations' products are legal.  The court's decision represents the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and signature economic policy, potentially forcing the US to refund billions collected in tariffs.While the minute-long advert only includes excerpts from the original, five-minute-long address, it does not alter Reagan's words.The order in which he makes the comments has been changed. The advert's penultimate sentence is taken from near the beginning of his speech, and a phrase that features about halfway through the advert is likewise taken from an earlier point in the address.The original address - titled Address to the Nation on Free and Fair Trade - is regarding a specific set of tariffs the Reagan administration had at the time imposed on some Japanese goods.Reagan seeks to use the speech explain why he had introduced the tariffs in this \"special case\" despite his belief that \"imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take\".He makes clear that he wants to lift them as soon as possible \"to promote the prosperity and economic development that only free trade can bring\" - a position he stresses throughout the speech.Trump later doubled down on his criticism of the advert, writing that \"Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY\".Getty ImagesDoug Ford, Ontario's premier, has been a vocal critic of Trump's economic policiesThe advert was run as part of a campaign worth $75m Canadian dollars (£40m; $54m) on mainstream TV channels in the US.In a post accompanying the advert, Ford wrote that \"we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada\".China's embassy in Washington also used a similar Reagan clip in a post on X to cast doubt on Trump's global tariffs earlier this year.Ontario is Canada's most populous province and its largest regional economy, and has suffered the most as a result of the US tariffs. Ford hit back at Trump's earlier tariff threat against Canada by saying he was willing to cut off power supply to the US.He had also described Washington's trade policies against Canada as having pulled a knife and \"yanked it into us\", and called on US lawmakers to put pressure on Trump.Trump's sector-specific levies on Canadian goods include a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.The White House's global tariffs - particularly on steel, aluminium and cars - have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and putting pressure on businesses.Carney and Ford have not yet commented on Trump's announcement.It is the second time Trump has said he was ceasing trade talks with Canada, after Ottawa announced it would impose a digital services tax on US technology firms earlier this year.When Canada rescinded the tax, the White House said Carney had \"caved\" to pressure from Trump.",

    "body": "Four big questions from the Caerphilly by-election result1 hour agoAdrian BrowneWales political reporterPA MediaPlaid Cymru's Lindsay Whittle was celebrating victory just after 02:00 when the result was declaredAfter a night of high drama in Caerphilly, Plaid Cymru is celebrating a stunning by-election victory.Reform piled on the votes but suffered a setback after \"throwing everything\" at victory, only to finish second.Labour is nursing its wounds after a truly appalling result, coming a poor third in a part of the world it has owned for more than a century.As eyes turn to the full Senedd election in May, and the prospect of an exciting pre-election six months ahead, last night's result raises some key questions about what is clearly now a very different political world in Wales.How did Plaid Cymru pull it off?Lindsay Whittle and party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth presented Plaid as the alternative to ReformIt is difficult to overstate how ecstatic the party, and its leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, will be with Plaid Cymru's victory. Labour may reasonably point out that Plaid has long had a presence here, but this was a Senedd seat the late Hefin David won with 46% of the vote in 2021 and a constituency that has always been Labour in Cardiff Bay and Labour-owned for more than 100 years at Westminster.Plaid Cymru successfully presented itself as the vehicle for change from a deeply unpopular Labour UK government and a Welsh Labour party that's been ruling the roost since Tony Blair's landslide victory in 1997.Aided by opinion polling showing Labour on the slide and Reform on the rise, Plaid Cymru was able to frame the by-election as straight choice between itself and Nigel Farage's party.Plaid's challenge has long been to break out of its traditional Welsh-speaking heartlands in north and west Wales. Parking the potentially divisive issue of independence for Wales, front and centre under previous leader Adam Price, has been part of the solution, Ap Iorwerth is downplaying independence for now, promising to publish a plan for Welsh independence - but not within the first term of a Plaid-led government.The party campaigned in this by-election for a better funding deal for Wales from Westminster, attracting jobs and improving healthcare - nothing to scare the horses.Expect a similar approach for the 2026 election.The momentum is clearly with Plaid Cymru now, the question is whether it can maintain that between now and May.Where does Labour go from here?Getty ImagesLabour candidate Richard Tunnicliffe had a dreadful nightThe result for Labour's Richard Tunnicliffe is abysmal.A Labour loss was widely expected, so a victory for the party would have been astonishing, but that does not diminish the significance or nature of this defeat.There are, naturally, caveats. By-elections are frequently different beasts from full elections, Caerphilly voters might behave differently in just a few short months.But this close to that full Senedd election, Labour appear to be in deep in the mire.Crucially, last night's result goes with the grain of everything we have been hearing about the trouble Labour is in across Wales - from pollsters, voters, rival parties and even figures within the party itself.Welsh Labour figures blame Sir Keir Starmer for their Caerphilly woes rather than First Minister Eluned Morgan.They want more muscular efforts to distinguish her Welsh administration from his.Others call for a \"big retail offer\" to capture voters' imagination come May. It is beginning to look desperate. Could the real game be about limiting Labour losses, rather than expecting to be the biggest party in Cardiff Bay?Might Labour's best hope be to win enough seats in six months time to give it the option of joining a Plaid-Labour Welsh government as junior partner, perhaps with some Greens and Liberal Democrats - a \"progressive coalition\" to keep Reform out?How big a setback is the result for Reform?Getty ImagesThere was a huge swing to Reform's Llŷr Powell, but it was not enoughThere are no prizes for coming second in first-past-the-post, but capturing 36% of the vote after winning just 2% in 2021 is no mean feat.Reform UK is developing an increasingly sophisticated campaign machine and will have learned from this experience.Interesting trends were at play in Caerphilly. The Nigel Farage media show, when it comes to town is great at capturing attention and so it was here.But did the Farage fireworks, appearing to dominate the discourse, in some ways, aid Plaid campaigners' efforts to urge Labour voters to back them to stop Reform?Reform figures say they still expect to win the coming Senedd election. Whether or not this is the case, anything like this result in May would mean a major Reform presence in Cardiff Bay under a new, proportional system.What does Caerphilly mean for the Senedd election?Getty ImagesThe contest for seats in Cardiff Bay looks set to be hotly contestedIt is the start of what is likely to be the most exciting six months in Welsh politics most of us can remember.The record turnout of 50.43% suggests that, when you introduce some jeopardy into the mix, voters do become engaged. The message of change, mixed with some voters being motivated to back Plaid to stop Reform, proved the winning formula for Plaid Cymru this time.Devolved elections, let's be frank, haven't been the most exciting experiences over the past couple of decades.Whatever happens between now and May's Senedd election, it will not be boring!More top stories",

    "body": "7 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, in JerusalemAFPThe bodies of the dead Palestinians were transferred by the Red Cross in refrigerated lorriesOut of a single room, with no DNA testing facilities or cold storage units of its own, the forensics team at Gaza's Nasser hospital face the challenges brought by peace.Over the past eleven days, 195 bodies have been returned to Gaza by Israeli authorities, in exchange for the bodies of 11 Israeli hostages, under the terms of Donald Trump's ceasefire deal. Two other bodies – those of Tanzanian and Thai hostages – have also been returned.Photographs released by Gaza's medical authorities show some of the bodies badly decomposed, and arriving in civilian clothes or naked except for underwear, some with multiple signs of injury. Many have their wrists tied behind their backs, and doctors say some bodies arrived blindfolded or with cloth roped around their necks.The forensic team at Nasser hospital are working with almost no resources to answer vast questions about torture, mistreatment and identity.The head of the unit, Dr Ahmed Dheir, said one of their biggest limitations is a lack of cold storage space. The bodies arrive in Gaza thoroughly frozen and can take several days to thaw out, ruling out even basic identification methods like dental history, let alone any deeper investigation or post-mortem (autopsy).\"The situation is extremely challenging,\" he said. \"If we wait for the bodies to thaw, rapid decomposition begins almost immediately, putting us in an impossible position [because] we lose the ability to examine the remains properly. So the most viable method is to take samples and document the state of the bodies as they are.\"Dr Ahmed Dheir says the lack of cold storage space means he and his colleagues have little time to examine the remains properlyThe BBC has viewed dozens of photographs of the bodies, many of them shared by Gaza's health authorities, others taken by colleagues on the ground.We spoke to several of those involved in examining the bodies in Gaza, as well as families of the missing, human rights groups, and Israeli military and prison authorities.We also spoke to three forensic experts outside the region, including one specialising in torture, to educate ourselves about the medical processes involved in this kind of investigation – all agreed that there were questions that were difficult to answer without post-mortems.Dr Alaa al-Astal, one of the forensic team at Nasser hospital, said some of the bodies arriving there showed \"signs of torture\", such as bruises and marks from binding on the wrists and ankles.\"There were extremely horrific cases, where the restraint was so tight that blood circulation to the hands was cut off, leading to tissue damage and clear signs of pressure around the wrists and ankles,\" he said.\"Even around the eyes, when the blindfolds were removed, you could see deep grooves - imagine how much force that took. The pressure left actual marks where the blindfold had been tied.\"Dr Astal also mentioned the loose cloths tied around the necks of some bodies as needing further investigation.\"In one case, there was a groove around the neck,\" he said. \"To determine whether the death was due to hanging or strangulation, we needed to perform a post-mortem, but because the body was frozen, it was not dissected.\"The bodies are bring brought to a temporary facility at Nasser hospital in Khan YounisSameh Yassin Hamad, a member of the Hamas-run government committee responsible for receiving the bodies, said there were signs of bruising and blood infiltration indicating that the bodies had been severely beaten before death. He also said there were stab wounds on the chest or face of some of them.Some of the images we saw from the unit clearly show deep indentations or tightly-fastened cable-ties on the wrists and arms and ankles. One photograph appears to show the bruising and abrasion that would confirm that ties had been used while the person was still alive.Other bodies showed only deep indentation marks, meaning a post-mortem would be needed to determine whether the ties had been used before or after death. Cable-ties are sometimes used when transporting bodies in Israel.When we asked Israel's military about the evidence we gathered, it said it operates strictly in accordance with international law.We showed the photographs we were given to the outside forensic experts. The images represent a fraction of the bodies transferred to Gaza by the Red Cross.All three experts said that some of the markings raised questions about what had happened, but that it was difficult to reach concrete conclusions about abuse or torture without  post-mortems.\"What is happening in Gaza is an international forensic emergency,\" said Michael Pollanen, a forensic pathologist and professor at the University of Toronto. \"Based upon images like this, there is an imperative for complete medical autopsies.  We need to know the truth behind how deaths occurred, and the only way to know the truth is to do autopsies.\"But even with limited forensic data, doctors at Nasser hospital say the routine cuffing of wrists behind the body rather than in front, along with the marks observed on the limbs, points to torture.\"When a person is naked, with their hands tied behind their back, and visible restraint marks on their wrists and ankles, it indicates that they died in that position,\" Dr Dheir told us. \"This is a violation of international law.\"And there is strong evidence to suggest widespread abuse of detainees - including civilians - in Israeli custody in the months after the war began in October 2023, particularly in the military facility of Sde Teiman.Unidentified bodies are being buried in a mass grave once forensic exams have been carried out\"At least in the first eight months of the war, the detainees from Gaza were cuffed behind their backs, and had their eyes covered, 24 hrs, 7 days a week, for months,\" said Naji Abbas, head of the Prisoners and Detainees Programme at the Israeli human rights organisation, Physicians for Human Rights (PHRI).\"We know that people developed serious infections on their skin, hands and legs because of the cuffs.\"We have spoken to several people who worked at Sde Teiman over the past two years, who confirm that detainees were cuffed hand and foot – even while undergoing medical treatments, including surgery.One medic who worked there said he had campaigned to loosen the cuffs, and that the treatment of detainees there was \"dehumanisation\".But many of those detained during the Gaza war are held as unlawful combatants, without charge.One complication for doctors at Nasser Hospital now is determining which of the returned bodies are Hamas fighters killed in combat, which are civilians and which are detainees who died in Israeli custody.Some of the bodies returned by Israel are still wearing Hamas headbands or military boots, but doctors say most are either naked or in civilian clothing, making it difficult to distinguish their role, interpret their injuries, and assess human rights violations.Photographs seen by the BBC show mostly naked or decomposed bodies. One dressed in civilian clothing and trainers has what officials say are two small bullet wounds in his back.AFPOfficials at Nasser hospital have been showing pictures of the bodies and any personal items to relatives of missing peopleSameh Yassin Hamad, from Gaza's Forensics Committee, said that Israel had sent back identification with only six of the 195 bodies it had returned – and that five of those names turned out to be wrong.\"Since these bodies were held by the Israeli authorities, they will have full data about them,\" said Dr Dheir. \"But they haven't shared that information with us through the Red Cross. We were sent DNA profiles for around half the total number of dead, but have not received any details about the dates or circumstances of death, or the time or place of detention.\"We asked Israel's army about the details in this report, including striking allegations by Gaza's forensic team that Israel had removed single fingers and toes from the bodies for DNA testing.Israel's military said \"all bodies returned so far are combatants within the Gaza Strip.\"  It denied tying any bodies prior to their release.A spokeswoman for the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Shosh Bedrosian, on Wednesday described the reports from Gaza as \"just more efforts to demonise Israel\" and suggested the media focus instead on the experience of Israeli hostages.Somaya Abdullah was at the hospital looking for her sonAs families of those missing gather at the hospital gates, Dr Dheir and his staff are under intense pressure to identify the dead and provide answers about what happened to them.So far, only some 50 bodies have been positively identified – mostly through basic details like height, age and obvious previous injuries.  Another 54 have been buried, unidentified and unclaimed, because of intense pressure on space at the unit.Many families of the missing attended the burial of the unnamed dead this week, just in case one of them was theirs.\"Honestly, it's hard to bury a body when you don't know whether it's the right one or not,\" said Rami al-Faraa, still searching for his cousin.\"If there was [DNA] testing, we'd know where he is – yes or no,\" said Houwaida Hamad, searching for her nephew.  \"My sister would know if the one we're burying is really her son or not.\"Donald Trump's ceasefire deal has brought some relief for Gaza, but little closure for the families of most of those missing, left burying a body in place of a brother, husband or son.Correction 24 October 2025: An earlier version of this story said the bodies of 13 Israeli hostages had been returned. This has been amended to a figure of 11 Israeli bodies, as well as that of one Tanzanian and one Thai.",

His fishing boat had capsized.Just two days earlier, the vessel had ventured out on what he had hoped would be a long and fruitful voyage. But as the winds grew stronger, its captain was ordered to turn back. On the way to port, a powerful wave struck from two directions creating a whirlpool, and the boat flipped. Five of the 10 crew members, who had been asleep in their cabins below deck, drowned.\"When I heard the news, I felt like the sky was falling,\" said Mr Hong.Last year, 164 people were killed or went missing in accidents in the seas around South Korea – a 75% jump from the year before. Most were fishermen whose boats sunk or capsized.\"The weather has changed, it's getting windier every year,\" said Mr Hong, who also chairs the Jeju Fishing Boat Owners Association. \"Whirlwinds pop up suddenly. We fisherman are convinced it is down to climate change.\"South Korean CoastguardFive of Mr Hong's crew members drowned when this fishing boat capsized in FebruaryAlarmed by the spike in deaths, the South Korean government launched an investigation into the accidents.This year, the head of the taskforce pinpointed climate change as one of the major causes, as well as highlighting other problems - the country's aging fishing workforce, a growing reliance on migrant workers, and poor safety training.The seas around Korea are warming more rapidly than the global average, in part because they tend to be shallower. Between 1968 and 2024, the average surface temperature of the country's seas increased by 1.58C, more than double the global rise of 0.74C.Warming waters are contributing to extreme weather at sea, creating the conditions for tropical storms, like typhoons, to become more intense.They are also causing some fish species around South Korea to migrate, according to the country's National Institute of Fisheries Science, forcing fisherman to travel further and take greater risks to catch enough to make a living.Environmental campaigners say urgent action is needed to \"stop the tragedy occurring in Korean waters\".BBC/Hosu LeeSome fish species are migrating from the waters around South KoreaOn a rainy June morning, Jeju Island's main harbour was crammed with fishing boats. The crews hurried back and forth between sea and land, refuelling and stocking up for their next voyage, while the boats' owners paced anxiously along the dock watching the final preparations.\"I'm always afraid something might happen to the boat, the risks have increased so much,\" said 54-year-old owner, Kim Seung-hwan. \"The winds have become more unpredictable and extremely dangerous.\"A few years ago, Mr Kim began to notice that the popular silvery hairtail fish he relied on were disappearing from local waters, and his earnings plunged by half.Now his crews have to journey into deeper, more perilous waters to find them, sometimes sailing as far south as Taiwan.\"Since we're operating farther away, it's not always possible to return quickly when there's a storm warning,\" he said. \"If we stayed closer to shore it would be safer, but to make a living we have to go farther out.\"BBC/Hosu LeeFishermen on South Korea's Jeju Island say hairtail fish have become scarcerProfessor Gug Seung-gi led the investigation into the recent accidents, which found that South Korea's seas appear to have become more dangerous. It noted the number of marine weather warnings around the Korean Peninsula - alerting fishermen to gales, storm surges, and typhoons - increased by 65% between 2020 and 2024.\"Unpredictable weather is leading to more boats capsizing, especially small fishing vessels that are going further out and are not built for such long, rough trips,\" he told the BBC.Professor Kim Baek-min, a climate scientist at South Korea's Pukyong National University, said that although climate change was creating the conditions to make strong, sudden wind gusts more likely, a clear trend had not yet been established – for that, more research and long-term data is needed.BBC/Hosu LeeCaptain Park fishes for anchovies from this small boatOne foggy morning, we left shore in the dark on a small trawler with Captain Park Hyung-il, who has been fishing anchovies off Korea's south coast for more than 25 years. He sang sea shanties, determined to stay upbeat. But when we reached the nets he had left out overnight, his mood crumpled.As he wound them in, the anchovies could barely be seen among the hordes of jellyfish and other fodder. Once the anchovies had been separated out, they filled just two boxes.\"In the past, we'd fill 50 to 100 of these baskets in a single day,\" he said. \"But this year the anchovies have vanished and we're catching more jellyfish than fish.\"This is the predicament facing tens of thousands of fishermen along South Korea's coastlines. Over the past 10 years, the amount of squid caught in South Korean waters each year has plummeted 92%, while anchovy catches have fallen by 46%.BBC/Hosu LeeThere are far fewer anchovies to be sorted by fishing workersEven the anchovies Park had caught were not fit for market, he said, and would need to be sold as animal-feed.\"The haul is basically worthless,\" he sighed, explaining it would barely cover the day's fuel costs, let alone his crew's wages.\"The sea is a mess, nothing makes sense anymore,\" Park continued. \"I used to love this job. There was joy knowing that someone, somewhere in the country was eating the fish I caught. But now, with barely anything to catch, that sense of pride is fading.\"And, with livelihoods disappearing, young people no longer want to join the industry. In 2023 almost half of South Korea's fishermen were over the age of 65, up from less than a third a decade earlier.Increasingly, elderly captains must rely on help from migrant workers from Vietnam and Indonesia. Often these workers do not receive sufficient safety training, and language barriers mean they cannot communicate with the captains – further compounding the dangers.Woojin Chung, South Korea's chief representative at the UK-based Environmental Justice Foundation, described it as \"a vicious and tragic cycle\".When you combine more extreme weather with the pressure to travel further, the increased fuel costs this brings, and the need to rely on cheap, untrained foreign labour, \"you have a higher chance of meeting disaster\", she explained.BBC/Hosu LeeFishermen Jong-un (left) and Yong-mook (right) were killed in a fishing boat accident this yearOn 9 February this year, a large shipping trawler sank suddenly near the coastal city of Yeosu, killing 10 of the crew. It was a bitterly cold, windy day, and smaller boats had been banned from going out, but this trawler was deemed sturdy enough to withstand the gales. The reason it went down is still a mystery.One of those killed was 63-year-old Young-mook. A fisherman for 40 years, he had been planning to retire, but that morning someone called and asked him to fill a last-minute opening on the boat.\"It was so cold that once you fell in you wouldn't survive the hypothermia, especially at his age,\" said his daughter Ean, still distraught over his death.Ean thinks it has become too easy for boat owners to blame climate change for accidents. Even in cases where bad weather plays a role, she believes it is still the owners' responsibility to assess the risks and keep their crew safe. \"Ultimately it is their call when to go out,\" she said.BBC/Hosu LeeYoung-mook's daughter Ean (right) wants boat owners to make their vessels saferAs a child, she remembers her father's fridge would be filled with crabs and squid. \"Now the stocks are gone, but the companies still force them to go out, and because these men have worked as fishermen their whole lives, they don't have alternative job options, so they keep fishing even when they're too frail to do so,\" she said.Ean also wants owners to better maintain their boats, which are aging too. \"Companies have insurance, so they get compensated after a boat sinks, but our loved ones can't be replaced.\"The authorities, aware they cannot control the weather, are now working with fishermen to make their boats safer. As we were with Mr Hong, whose boat capsized earlier this year, a team of government inspectors arrived to carry out a series of on-the-spot checks on two of his other vessels.The government's taskforce is recommending that boats be fitted with safety ladders, fisherman be required to wear life jackets, and that safety training be mandatory for all foreign crew. It also wants to improve search and rescue operations, and for fisherman to have access to more localised and real-time weather updates.Some regions are even offering to pay fishermen for the jellyfish they catch, to try to clean up the seas, while squid fishermen are being given loans to protect them from bankruptcy, and encourage them to retire.BBC/Hosu LeeBecause the problem will likely worsen. The UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation forecasts that total fish catches in South Korea will decline by almost a third by the end of this century, if carbon emissions and global warming continue on their current trajectories.\"The future looks very bleak,\" said the anchovy fisherman Captain Park, now in his late 40s. He recently started a YouTube channel documenting his catches in the hope of earning some extra money. Park is the third generation of his family to do this work and likely the last.\"Back then it felt romantic getting up early and heading out to sea. There was a sense of adventure and reward.\"\"These days it's just really tough.\"Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun Choi",

    "body": "Sheffield Wednesday have been placed in administration and hit with an automatic 12-point deduction by the EFL. Julian Pitts, Kris Wigfield and Paul Stanley of Begbies Traynor have been appointed joint-administrators after it was revealed His Majesty's Revenue & Customs were set to issue a winding-up petition against the club.Staff have been briefed, while administrators also held a meeting with players. The Owls host Oxford United at Hillsborough on Saturday (15:00 BST) with the club bottom of the Championship and now on -6 points.While enforcing the immediate deduction, in a statement the EFL said that administration was \"the opportunity to move matters towards a successful sale and secure future under new ownership\". The move into administration effectively ends Dejphon Chansiri's decade-long ownership of the club with the Sheffield Wednesday Supporters Trust confirming their boycott of matches is over.BBC Sport has contacted Sheffield Wednesday for comment.BBC Sheffield understands there are interested buyers and that the administrators are already in active discussions and are also inviting formal offers from other credible potential investors.Wigfield, a managing partner at Begbies Traynor, said: \"The joint administrators have taken over the running of the club with immediate effect to protect the interests of creditors, and to ensure Sheffield Wednesday can continue operating while we seek a new owner as swiftly as possible.\"Like many football clubs, it has been trading at a significant loss for many years, with those losses historically funded by the owner. Mr Chansiri is no longer willing to provide that financial support.\"While the recent fan boycott has not directly caused the insolvency, it has increased financial pressure on the club. As a result, the owner has chosen to place the club into administration.\"Supporters are the backbone of any football club. The money they spend at the gate and in the ground is vital. I've been a season ticket holder since 1984 and know first-hand the passion of this fanbase.\"Now, more than ever, we need fans back in the ground — buying tickets, merchandise, pies and pints. Every penny spent will go directly to supporting the day-to-day running of this club, not to the former owner or professional costs. This will help stabilise the club while we secure a suitable buyer.\"Creditors of the club have been encouraged to contact the administrators to register a claim.Stanley, one of the other joint administrators, said: \"There should be no interruption to the fixture schedule and we are in close contact with the EFL to ensure the effects of this administration on the employees, supporters, the community and the players are minimised as far as possible.\"Sheffield Wednesday is a massive, historic club with a loyal fanbase in a city that lives and breathes football. If more fans return to Hillsborough, the club can cover its day-to-day costs and move towards a viable sale to a new ownership capable of restoring long-term stability.\"With the right ownership structure, we are confident the club has a bright future and will meet all EFL regulatory obligations.\"Thai businessman Chansiri took over at Hillsborough in March 2015 with ambitions to lead the club back into the Premier League for the first time since 2000.They were beaten in the Championship play-off final by Hull City the following May but that was the closest they came to ending their top-flight exile under his ownership and were relegated to League One in 2020-21 after a six-point deduction for breaking spending rules.Darren Moore led them back to the second tier in 2023 but left by mutual consent shortly afterwards and Danny Rohl then stabilised the club after a wretched start to 2023-24 under Xisco Munoz.During Chansiri's reign there had previously been some issues with wage payments but things really came to the fore when May's wages were not paid on time, having previously happened in March.At present, they are under five EFL embargoes and wages have not been paid on time in five of the past seven months.The highly-rated Rohl, who has now taken over at Rangers, departed in July and his assistant Henrik Pedersen took charge with the club unable to add to their small playing squad because of the financial issues.As well as protests before and during games this season, fans boycotted the EFL Cup ties with Leeds United and Grimsby Town, while a small number entered the field of play to temporarily halt the 5-0 home reverse by Coventry City and there was then a mass boycott of the league game with Middlesbrough.Chansiri has been absent from the club for the whole period of turmoil.",

    "body": "13 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesCarlile was a key part of Joni Mitchell's rehabilitation, sitting with her as she relearned her own lyrics after a brain haemorrhageWhen Brandi Carlile was 12 years old, living in a mobile home in an isolated community 50 miles outside Seattle, she begged her parents for a piano. She'd fallen in love with her mum's Elton John albums and wanted to play along.But when she broke her tiny Casio keyboard out of its Toys R Us box, she had to face an uncomfortable reality. \"I was just nowhere near talented enough,\" she laughs.Instead, she put on Bruce Springsteen's Streets Of Philadelphia, dialled up the keyboard's \"synth strings\" setting, and pressed down two keys.\"You just hold them, all the way through the verse,\" she recalls. \"Anyone can do it, but that's the foundation of my career.\"Fast forward 32 years and Elton John is one of her best friends. In January, they released a collaborative album, Who Believes In Angels, that topped the UK charts (Carlile contributed significantly more than two notes).The musician has also been responsible for Joni Mitchell's musical rehabilitation, coaxing the 81-year-old back onto the stage after a near-fatal brain haemorrhage. And she's spent the last six years duetting with some of pop's biggest stars, from Miley Cyrus to Noah Kahan, while curating her annual Girls Just Wanna festival in Mexico.All those opportunities stemmed from a single performance at the 2019 Grammys, where Carlile delivered a spine-tingling version of The Joke, an anthemic ballad for the persecuted.\"I'd played that song hundreds of times but I never could really hit that last note,\" she confesses now. \"But at the Grammys, I really wanted to get it right. So for days leading up to the show, I trained and I trained and I trained. And when I hit it, I could hardly finish the song. I wanted to jump up and down.\"She wasn't the only one. Jaws were dropped. Eyes were popped. A star was born. Before she'd even left the stage, Carlile's phone was blowing up with texts from people \"so famous I couldn't fathom it\".\"I suddenly had this river of opportunity flowing into my life, and I didn't know how long it was going to last, and so I said yes to everything,\" she recalls.EPAThe star gave one of the stand-out performances at this year's Glastonbury festival, where she made her debut on the Pyramid StageLooking back, she reckons the eagerness to grasp those opportunities was a reaction to her childhood. Growing up in rural America, Carlile knew she was gay, but had \"never met\" another gay person in her life. Her sexuality changed her relationship with her mother. \"All the ways she thought she was going to relate to me, she couldn't,\" says Carlile. \"I didn't want to do make-up or learn to shave my legs or have long hair, and she was just like, 'What do I do with this child?'\"They eventually bonded over music - even forming a sort of informal tribute act to mother-daughter band The Judds.But the sense of otherness remained, even after Carlile married and had two kids with British charity director Catherine Shepherd. So when opportunity came knocking, she felt obliged to chase it.\"I think it could be the gay thing, this kind of coyote thing, where it's like, 'Keep your eye on the prize. You're being included right now, you might not be included tomorrow. Accept everything, do everything, achieve, assimilate,'\" she says.Getty ImagesCarlile formed a country supergroup with Maren Morris (left) and tempted Texan superstar Tanya Tucker (centre) out of retirementThen, as suddenly as it arrived, the instinct vanished. Last October, she flew straight from a show with Joni Mitchell to a recording session with Aaron Dessner - co-founder of rock group The National, and a key collaborator for Taylor Swift.By the time she landed in New York, she was hungover and overwhelmed with emotion. Instinctively, she knew the comeback concerts she'd masterminded with Joni had run their course. \"I couldn't bear the thought of not sitting next to her and listening to her sing Both Sides Now again,\" she says. \"I'd had the best damn seat in the house.\"Dessner showed Carlile a few pieces he'd been working on, then left her to work in his barn. Exhausted, she went upstairs, climbed into bed, and wrote a poem that captured her mood.\"Returning to myself is such a lonely thing to do / But it's the only thing to do.\"After six years of chasing opportunities, it was time to turn inwards.   \"I knew I was at the end of something,\" she says, \"and that, yes, the phone might stop ringing, but I don't want to miss out on my kids' childhood.\"Collier Schorr\"When I look back on my life - my sense of serial monogamy, being raised in an addicted household, I don't think I ever have come into myself in some ways,\" says CarlileThe poem became the title track and north star for her new album, which wrestles with the passage of time, and the delicacy of human connection. When Dessner started playing atmospheric synth chords in the studio, it unlocked the memory of those first musical experiments on her Casio keyboard.\"I felt 13 or 14 again, and it made me write things differently,\" she says. \"I had this huge lump in my throat the whole time. I was embarrassed to sing the songs in front of everybody because I thought I would cry - and I did.\"Listeners might need a box of tissues, too. When Carlile played You Without Me at Glastonbury this summer, there were more than a few misty eyes, as people digested the story of a parent coming to terms with their child's independence.\"I've started to see those moments, and it's soul crushing,\" says the singer, whose  eldest daughter, Evangeline, is 11. \"But at the same time you're overwhelmed with pride.\"Same-sex marriage threatHer daughters inspired one of the record's angrier songs, too. Church And State rails against the increasing influence of conservative religious ideology on US politics. Recorded live on election night 2024, it addresses Carlile's fear that the Supreme Court could overturn Obergefell v Hodges, which recognised same-sex marriage in 2015. It was prompted by a dinner conversation, where Evangeline suggested the family could just get on Carlile's boat and \"bebop up to Canada\" if gay marriage was outlawed.\"I don't want to go to Canada,\" protested their youngest, Elijah.\"And Evangeline just snapped and said, 'Elijah, it's better than not having a mommy or a mama'.\"I felt so ashamed for not explaining it better. They assumed that if it ever happened, they'd be orphans.\"And then I felt so angry that something so archaic and antiquated could even be a possibility in the country I live in, let alone legitimately on the horizon.\"Getty ImagesCarlile helped to orchestrate the \"Joni Jam\" concert series, where Mitchell would hold court over a rotating cast of musicians, performing some of her biggest songs and deepest cutsThe album's other guiding light is Mitchell, whose strict quality control is \"the reason I write a lot fewer songs,\" Carlile says.She pays an affectionate but cheeky tribute to the singer on a song simply called Joni. \"She doesn't suffer fools, she won't make cups of tea, and she won't bandage bruised egos,\" sings Carlile over a delicately plucked guitar. \"She is a wild woman,\" laughs the star. \"She's 83 and she will drink you under the table. \"She loves Cadillac margaritas and plain Black Jack. And she is unpredictable, untameable, unknowable sometimes, and it's amazing.\"Presumably it was nerve-wracking to play Mitchell the song?\"Oh, I was quaking,\" she laughs. \"She was sitting at her desk in her bedroom, putting butterfly clips in her hair, as Joni Mitchell does, and just listening to the song with this furrowed brow, not reacting whatsoever. \"But this big smile spread across her face after the last chorus. Then she made me wait a good minute before she nodded at me like, 'This is great.'\"One lyric, however, created a little friction. \"When I tell you I love you, and you tell me 'OK'... That's love in your way.\"\"When she heard that she called me an asshole!\" Carlile laughs, \"because she knew exactly what I meant - and you're not supposed to get Joni Mitchell. She doesn't want to be understood.\"As you might expect, Carlile is full of similarly starry anecdotes.She recalls seeing Paul McCartney at the side of the stage during her Glastonbury set (\"that was a top five moment\"); and spills the beans on Dolly Parton's tattoos (\"I haven't seen them, but I know people who have. She can be really rugged and curse.\")So what would that lonely child, who warmed her hands around a wooden stove and struggled to play Elton John songs, think about her elevation to the highest echelons of music?\"I have a lot of affection for that girl now, in ways that I didn't at the time,\" she reflects.\"She would love to know that it happened and that she made it. Because I've made it beyond where I hoped, and I'm not sure what to do with that.\"If Returning To Myself is the first draft of her answer, it suggests the possibilities are limitless. With a new confidence and a new direction, Carlile is breaking into uncharted territory: Herself.",

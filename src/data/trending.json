    "body": "Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes was a potential medal hope in this event but she is not in the final after finishing 16th in qualification. Reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand topped qualification, ahead of the Netherlands' Melissa Peperkamp. The rest of the field were at least nine points behind the pair. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. That was the case in runs one and two too, with Lochner leading Friedrich by 0.80. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, are down in eighth, 0.40 off the medals. Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. He was fifth in qualification. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, and he qualified in third. USA's Mac Forehand and Austria's Matej Svancer were the top two in qualification. Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentandClaire KeenanEPALocal election administrators have warned that councils face \"an uphill struggle\" to be ready in time for the May local elections after the government reversed its plan to delay some votes. Local Government Secretary Steve Reed had initially approved delays in 30 council elections in England until 2027.But the government abandoned plans to postpone ballots after advice was given that the move could be unlawful. It followed a legal challenge brought by Reform UK.A group that represents electoral officials in the UK said the teams who help to run elections had lost months of preparation time and would struggle to be ready.The government argued that some councils were worried about the cost of running elections for authorities which are due to be abolished in a major reorganisation of local government.Local elections in Norfolk, Suffolk, Blackburn, Lincoln, Thurrock and two dozen more parts of England, will now take place on 7 May, and about £63 million will be made available to local authorities who are undergoing changes.Some organisers said they were still preparing anyway, aware there was a legal challenge to the government's decision to postpone votes in their areas, which was due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA) said it was \"extremely disappointed\" that months of \"essential planning time\" had been lost. The AEA's deputy chief executive Laura Lock said returning officers, electoral registration officers, and electoral administration teams would be affected. \"These teams now face an uphill struggle to catch up to where they should be,\" she said.The AEA represents electoral officials in the UK, and provides training. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit, told BBC Breakfast the elections would put pressure on \"hard-working council officers\".\"It will be done, as always, by hard-working council officers just going the extra mile, working harder, doing the extra hours, giving up their weekends. They can do it, but I don't think it's fair to ask them to\", he said.He said the situation \"damages our democratic process\", and warned the  last-minute change sends the message that \"these elections are optional\".Matthew Hicks, leader of Tory-run Suffolk County Council said: \"Local councils across the country are experiencing whiplash as major government decisions shift repeatedly and without warning.\"Hicks said the uncertainty impacted on the ability \"to plan effectively\" and \"deliver stability for residents\".Meanwhile, the leader of Labour-run Thurrock Council Lynn Worrall said it was \"disappointing that this decision has been reversed so late in the day\".The announcement made on Monday was welcomed by opposition parties, who had called the delays undemocratic.In celebration of his win, Nigel Farage, writing on X, said: \"We took this Labour government to court and won.\"The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal costs relating to the proceedings, which a party source said would be at least £100,000.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party \"fought tooth and nail to stop this stitch-up and the government has been forced into a humiliating U-turn\".Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoAna Faguy,Washington DCandEloise Alanna,MontrealWatch: 'Integrity in sport is important' - Canadians react to Olympic curling cheating rowA scandal at the Winter Olympics has left the Canadian curling teams on the defensive and Canadians reeling over the crack in their country's polite persona.Over the weekend, Canadian curler Marc Kennedy had an expletive-filled outburst after Sweden accused him of cheating during a match, and later said his team might be the target of a \"premeditated\" attack by their rivals.Kennedy was accused of \"double-touching\" - touching the stone a second time after initially releasing it down the ice. The next day, Canadian women's captain Rachel Holman was accused of using the same move. Both have denied the accusations, but Canada's curling teams, who historically have dominated the sport, now face questions over their tactics. While the curlers have shown their anger over the situation during matches, fans of the sport and Canadians have questioned whether the team acted in the spirit of curling.\"It's a sad day for Canadian sport,\" Tim Gray, from Alberta, told the BBC. \"Integrity in the sport is important, even if you have to call it on yourself.\"An opinion piece in the Canadian news outlet, the Globe and Mail, pointed to some of the frustration: \"These Canadian curling teams are not fun bad guys. They come off like the sort of competitors who need so desperately to win that they will do anything – even things that are pointless – in order to get there.\"Cathal Kelly, the writer of the opinion piece, continued: \"There's an easy way out of this – stop struggling. Stop acting like our curling reputation matters more than our national one. Be the bigger man and woman, even if you don't think you did anything wrong.\"The controversy began on Friday when Swedish player Oskar Eriksson accused Kennedy of double-touching. As the game continued, Kennedy and Eriksson got into a verbal back-and-forth that included expletives. Their exchange quickly went viral as a video appearing to show Kennedy touching the stone on occasion.Kennedy got a verbal warning from World Curling for using foul language, but he was not formally charged with cheating by the governing body. The next day Kennedy said: \"I probably could have handled it better. But we're human out there and there's a lot of emotions. I'm not going to apologise for defending my teammates and standing up for myself.\" \"I've curled my whole life, never once with the intention of getting an advantage through cheating,\" he added. ReutersCanada's Marc Kennedy was accused of double-touching stones when he released themThen, Canadian curling had another instance of purported cheating. Match officials accused the Canadian women's team on Saturday of the same double-touch violation.  Rachel Homan who said there was a \"zero percent chance\" of the violation, as she and her teammates looked on frustratingly. The Canadians lost to the Swiss, 8-7.On Sunday, Great Britain's men's team was accused of the same violation. Both Homan and British men's curler Bobby Lammie had stones removed from play due to alleged violations.Homan later slammed the officials' decision to remove her stone during a defeat to Switzerland, saying it was \"insane\".All of the incidents led World Curling to clarify that double-tapping is not allowed.\"During forward motion, touching the granite of the stone is not allowed. This will result in the stone being removed from play,\" they said.World Curling does not use video to review play, but they did send two officials to monitor how players released their stones in subsequent games. \"Following a meeting with representatives of the competing National Olympic Committees, an update in the stone monitoring protocol has been confirmed, beginning with the evening session on Sunday 15 February,\" World Curling said in a statement.\"This change in protocol will see the two umpires who had previously been actively monitoring athlete deliveries remain available in the field of play, but will now only monitor athlete deliveries at the request of the competing teams.\"AFP via Getty ImagesCanada's Rachel Homan slammed the officials' decision to remove her stoneReaction to the controversy in Canada has been mixed.\"Do I think the finger affects the rock, no I do not,\" Ankara Leonard from the Royal Montreal Curling Club told the BBC. \"Do I think we have to play within the rules? Yes.\"While curling columnist and Olympian Tomi Rantamaki, in an article for The Curling News, warned that Canada's dominance in the world of curling means its players should be mindful of the influence they have.\"Young players in Finland, Korea, Italy, Sweden – everywhere – often copy what Canadian teams do. They copy the athlete's delivery, the sweeping, the tactics, the communication,\" Rantamaki wrote. \"And they copy the behaviour.\"",

    "body": "Teenagers guilty of killing man they lured to beach15 hours agoJoshua Askew,South EastandAdina Campbell,UK correspondentKent PoliceAll three teenagers denied the murder of Alexander Cashford, 49, in KentTwo teenagers have been found guilty of manslaughter after luring a man they thought was a paedophile to a beach where another teenager threw rocks at him.A 16-year-old girl and two boys, 15 and 16, all denied murdering Alexander Cashford in Leysdown-on-Sea, on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, on 10 August last year. The 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Woolwich Crown Court was told the teenagers believed Cashford, 49, was a paedophile after he met the girl by chance at an amusement arcade two days earlier and gave her his phone number.Using the alias Sienna, the three teenagers had messaged Cashford and arranged to meet him by the sea wall.Danny Robinson KC, defending the girl, told the court the texts started as a \"big laugh\" but might have become a wish to name and shame Cashford.\"It was a childish escapade that got out of hand very quickly with tragic consequences,\" he said.Footage shows the moment Alexander Cashford was attacked on the beachProsecutors said Cashford was chased and hit with rocks and a bottle before he was found lying face down in the mud.A post-mortem examination showed injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, alongside a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.The 16-year-old boy had earlier told the court how he and the others had discussed giving Cashford a \"slap\" before the attack.He claimed he attacked Cashford because he thought police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they had reported the man for trying to meet up with the girl.'Relentlessly pursued'The girl filmed the boys chasing Cashford as she shouted \"get him\", the court heard.After he was arrested, the 16-year-old boy shared footage of the attack with three people. \"This was a carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack on someone who was not expecting it and who could not defend himself,\" said Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\"The three teenagers – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were acquitted of murder on Monday.They are expected to be sentenced for manslaughter in April.\"These verdicts will change their lives forever,\" said the judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "14 hours agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Watch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Duvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsHis other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

    "body": "Six of Sarah Ferguson's companies winding down13 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterGetty ImagesSix companies linked to the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, are being wound down, documents filed with Companies House show.Ferguson is the director of all six businesses that are due to be struck off the register in ten days - unless legal cause is shown to prevent it.It is unclear what the firms' activities were, although one is related to public relations and another to retail. None appear to be very commercially active.Their closure comes in the wake of further revelations from the Epstein files which suggest the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told the wealthy paedophile how desperate she felt over her financial difficulties.Email exchanges between Ferguson and Epstein indicate she asked for his financial advice over how to deal with her £6m debt pile while he was still in jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.A spokesperson for the former Duchess of York has been approached for comment.The companies that are set to close are S Phoenix Events, Fergie's Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrepreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd, none of which have any public profile.Listings for five of the six companies state there is an \"application to strike the company off the register\". That means the company will stop trading and will cease to exist.The sixth, S Phoenix Events, which also notes the receipt of an application to strike off, lists Sarah Ferguson as the person authenticating the application on behalf of the company.Ferguson is listed as an active director for three other businesses registered with Companies House: Ginger and Moss, set up as a lifestyle brand to sell tea, jewellery and housewares, a \"motion picture production activities\" business called Coat, and Librasol, classified under \"artistic creation\" on the official register for private companies.All the companies being dissolved were set up more than a decade ago. Most are classed as \"dormant companies\", with very little or no reported recent commercial activity.Ferguson is the sole remaining director for all of them.Late last year, documents show she submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson.There have been reports of Ferguson's financial difficulties for many years, but the publication of the files of Jeffrey Epstein's correspondence has laid bare how much pressure she was under.One of the files suggests she told Epstein she was about to \"freak with exhaustion\" at a time when he was still in custody in Florida and that she also leaned on him for emotional support.",

    "body": "Ancient bone may prove legendary war elephant crossing of Alps15 hours agoGeorgina RannardScience reporterGetty ImagesHannibal's invasion of Europe has acquired almost mythical statusAn elephant foot bone found by archaeologists digging in southern Spain may be evidence that a troop of war elephants stomped through ancient Europe.It would be the first concrete proof of the legendary Carthaginian General Hannibal's troop of battle elephants, according to academics.Drawings of Hannibal's war against the Romans had long suggested that the beasts were used in fighting, but no hard evidence backed up the theories.Now the creatures' skeletal remains appear to have been found in an Iron Age dig near Cordoba.\"Beyond ivory, the discovery of elephant remains in European archaeological contexts is exceptionally rare,\" says the team of scientists in a paper published in Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.Often considered one of the most successful commanders of classical times, Hannibal led his army from the powerful imperial city Carthage, in modern day Tunisia, into Europe as he battled to control the Mediterranean.It is thought he took soldiers and animals from Carthage through Spain and France to invade Italy, crossing the Alps with 37 elephants in 218 BCE during the second of the so-called Punic Wars.The remains found in Spain are presumed to be from an animal that died before reaching the Alps.The archaeologists, led by Professor Rafael M. Martínez Sánchez, found the elephant's bone beneath a collapsed wall on a site called Colina de los Quemados. Martínez Sánchez et alThe top row is the Iron Age elephant bone found in SpainThey used carbon dating techniques to estimate the age of the 10cm cube-shaped bone. The result led them to believe it is from the Second Punic War.They also compared the bone of modern elephants and steppe mammoths to determine which animal it came from.The team found artillery, coins and ceramics during the excavations in 2020, providing more clues that the place was the site of a battle.\"As non-native species and the largest living terrestrial animals, these imported beasts would have required transportation by ship,\" the academics said.They say that it is very unlikely that dead animals were transported, and the bones are unattractive suggesting they were not decorative or used in craft.But the scientists say it will be very challenging to work out which species of elephant the creature was.\"While [the bone] would not represent one of the mythical specimens Hannibal took across the Alps, it could potentially embody the first known relic − so sought after by European scholars of the Modern Age − of the animals used in the Punic Roman wars for the control of the Mediterranean,\" the scientists conclude in their paper.",

He said it was \"a very hard blow\" for the region and for tourism.\"Nature as it created the bow, has taken it back\", he added.Passers-by first noticed the absence of the natural landmark on Sunday morning.Officials have suggested severe weather brought by a storm named Oriana - which has battered southern Italy in recent days - accelerated the rock's erosion, causing its collapse.\"We have lost one of our region's defining characteristics, a symbolic asset,\" Puglia's regional president Antonio Decaro told reporters at the site on Monday.\"Unfortunately, natural processes are often accelerated by meteorological phenomena, such as the tail end of storm Oriana\", he said.Decaro said authorities needed to concentrate on attempting to slow coastal erosion and preserving the coast.The Salento region, where the arch was located, is one of Italy's most popular tourist areas.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNews of the government abandoning plans to delay 30 council elections after a legal challenge from Reform UK is a focus of today's papers. The i Paper reports that it could trigger the \"next threat to Starmer's leadership\". Reform's leader Nigel Farage has hailed the reversal as a victory for his party and \"democracy in this country\". The paper quotes council leaders saying they are \"experiencing whiplash\" from the changes. The Financial Times also leads with the decision not to delay some 7 May elections in England after the government received \"advice that the move could be against the law\". It reports Farage saying he was \"delighted\" by the government's U-turn, and calling on Steve Reed, local government secretary, to resign.The Guardian also leads with the government's climb down, focusing on the angry reaction from Labour MPs. \"Most councillors feel devastated ... many didn't want to cancel elections. They felt pressurised into it,\" a Labour MP for one of the affected areas is quoted saying. Meanwhile, Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor who has died aged 95, makes the lead image. The Daily Mail reports Sir Keir Starmer will face the \"wrath of voters\" after he was forced to abandon \"controversial plans to cancel elections for millions\". The paper counts it as the prime minister's \"14th major U-turn\". Robert Duvall, who starred in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died \"peacefully\" aged 95, the Times reports, with an image of the Oscar-winning actor taking up the front page. The prime minister's decision to not delay elections in May is the lead story, with the Times reporting how the move \"increases the political jeopardy for Starmer\". Again, the Daily Telegraph leads with Labour's U-turns on plans to delay local elections for \"4.6m people after lawyers warned it would be illegal\". Sir Keir's new plan for children online safety leads the Metro today, with the prime minister promising to \"protect young people from addictive social media ... 'in months not years'\". The paper includes worries from a campaigner and co-founder of parental tool Safetymode, who is reported saying the plans will be like \"putting gaffer tape over a pothole\".\"Tributes to Godfather Star\" is the focus of the Daily Star, following the death of actor Robert Duvall, 95, who died on Sunday. His wife Luciana said: \"Goodbye to one of the greatest actors of all time\", the paper reports. \"Another Starmer U-turn\" is the Independent's lead headline today, as \"ministers change course ... with only 11 weeks to go\". A young Robert Duvall in a scene from Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now takes the lead image, as the paper remembers the actor who has died aged 95. The Daily Express claims Sir Keir \"stands accused\" of \"secretly plotting to lock\" Britain back into the European Union through his reset deals. The paper reports senior Tories saying the \"PM is planning to return our sovereignty to Brussels\". A grieving mother, who says her son's death was linked to a social media challenge, has welcomed the Labour government's change in online data law, the Daily Mirror reports. Ellen Roome has called for immediate action on social media reforms to \"save our next generation\". The Sun leads on an exclusive by its TV editor on the new Line of Duty series that will \"re-open the hunt to identify arch-villain 'H'\". The last season's finale was met with fury and disappointment from fans, the paper says. The government's decision to abandon plans to postpone local elections across 30 councils in England this May is the lead for many of this morning's papers. The Mail describes, what it says is Sir Keir Starmer's 14th major U-turn during his time in office, as a \"new humiliation\" for the prime minister. The Telegraph says it's heard from councillors and other local authority insiders who have spoken about the \"chaos\", \"turmoil\" and the \"unnecessary race against time\", they now face.The i Paper quotes one council leader as saying that local authorities are \"experiencing whiplash\" from changing government decisions, \"making it almost impossible\" to plan effectively for residents. It says the U-turn is \"triggering\" the next threat to Sir Keir's leadership.The Times describes as a \"watershed moment\" the fact that GP records can now be linked to the UK \"Biobank\". It holds the data of half a million middle-aged Britons who signed up to give blood samples to the project, more than twenty years ago. The paper says the link hadn't been possible before because of bureaucracy. It quotes researchers as saying that now NHS England has taken over the legal liability for the data, they will be able to use it to understand what's really causing disease and help them solve major health challenges.The Guardian says that UK bank chiefs will hold a first meeting this week to discuss alternatives to Visa and Mastercard because of fears that President Trump has the ability to turn off US owned payment systems. The paper reports that the meeting will bring together a group of city funders, who will cover the cost of a new payments company to keep the UK economy going, in case problems occur. The paper says the initiative, which would be government-backed, has been around for years, but that Donald Trump's recent threats against Greenland have raised concerns.Many of the papers carry photos of the Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall whose death was announced yesterday. He was 95 and best known for roles in films such as the Godfather and Apocalypse Now. The Telegraph calls him a \"scene-stealing star\". The Times says he was considered the quintessential \"thinking man's tough guy\".Related Internet Links",

To me, he was simply everything,\" she said. \"His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.\"Godfather star Al Pacino paid tribute, saying it was an \"honour\" to work with Duvall. He added: \"He was a born actor as they say, his connection with it, his understanding and his phenomenal gift will always be remembered. \"I will miss him.\"Duvall was known for numerous tough-guy roles over an impressive six-decade career, such as the mafia consigliere in Francis Ford Coppola‘s The Godfather and The Godfather Part II. He also played a forceful army officer in Coppola’s Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now.He only had a few minutes of screen time but his famous line in the 1979 classic, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\", became legendary.Coppola called his loss \"a blow\".\"Such a great actor and such an essential part of American Zoetrope from its beginning,\" Coppola said in a statement on Instagram, referring to his production company.His Apocalypse Now character was originally meant to be even more over the top but Duvall toned it down and the name was changed from Captain Carnage to Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore.\"I did my homework,\" Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. \"I did my research.”Getty ImagesTributes began to pour in for Duvall after news broke of his death. American comedian and actor Adam Sandler posted photographs of the two from their time together shooting the 2022 film Hustle.\"Funny as hell. Strong as hell. One of the greatest actors we ever had. Such a great man to talk to and laugh with ... sending his wife Luciana and all his family and friends our condolences.\"Oscar winner Jamie Lee-Curtis also posted a tribute on Instagram with a picture of Duvall as Tom Hagen in The Godfather. \"The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen. Bravo, Robert Duvall.\" Co-star, Robert Patrick, who played the son of Duvall's character in the 2013 film Jayne Mansfield's Car said he was \"gutted\". \"Over the years I would call Bobby and we'd talk movies and barbecue. He loved barbecue and I'd always let him know when I was having it in Lockhart, Texas.\"\"I will miss Bobby. I will always be proud that I got to play his son. Rest in peace my friend.\" The statement from Duvall's wife continued: \"For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.\"Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.\"Getty ImagesDuvall (left) appeared opposite Marlon Brando in The GodfatherCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall as Lt Col Kilgore in Apocalypse NowNominated for seven Oscars, Duvall won best actor in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.His other roles included a bullying corporate executive in 1976's Network, and a Marine officer in 1979's The Great Santini, as well as parts in 1990's The Handmaid's Tale and 2014's The Judge alongside Robert Downey Jr.Duvall often said his favourite role was as the Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove in the 1989 TV mini-series, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.He made his screen debut in the 1963 film adaptation of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, playing the reclusive Boo Radley.\"When he did To Kill A Mockingbird he just destroyed you with his performance of Boo Radley, he used not a single word of dialogue, not a single word, and he just shatters you,\" US actor Alec Baldwin said in a short video tribute to Duvall.The screenplay was written by Horton Foote, who also wrote several other films Duvall starred in, including Tender Mercies, Tomorrow and The Chase.In 1997’s The Apostle, which he wrote and directed, Duvall played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.British actress Jane Seymour, who worked with Duvall on the 1995 film The Stars Fell on Henrietta, shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram.\"We were able to share in his love of barbecue and even a little tango,\" Seymour wrote alongside a photo of herself with Duvall. \"Those moments off camera were just as memorable as the work itself.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoPeter Bowes,North America correspondentandChris GrahamGetty ImagesThe president spoke to the press on board Air Force One on Monday, describing the talks as \"very important\"Donald Trump has said he will be \"indirectly\" involved in the talks between Iran and the United States which are due to begin in Geneva later on Tuesday. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the US president added that he believed Iran wanted to make a deal over its nuclear programme. The second round of talks in Switzerland follows repeated military threats against Iran over the country's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and the ongoing dispute over its nuclear programme. On Monday the foreign ministry in Tehran said it believed that the US position on the nuclear issue had moved towards \"a more realistic one\".Iran says Tuesday's meeting, mediated by Oman, will focus on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions imposed by the US. Washington has previously indicated it wants to discuss other issues as well, such as Iran's missile stockpile.Framing the talks as \"very important\", Trump suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate. \"I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal,\" Trump said, adding that Iran learned the consequences of a tough posture in talks last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites. \"We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,\" Trump said, referring to the stealth bombers that carried out the bombings. \"I hope they're going to be more reasonable.\"The president's threats have come amid a US military build-up in the Middle East over the past few weeks. The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Middle East, which could arrive in the region within the next three weeks.In addition to the Abraham Lincoln's arrival, BBC Verify has also tracked an increase of US destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets in the region.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X he was in Geneva to \"achieve a fair and equitable deal\".\"What is not on the table: submission before threats,\" Araqchi said.ReutersThe US military released an image of the Lincoln carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea in FebruaryIran has responded to the US build-up with its own show of force. On Monday the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) launched a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran. The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states. Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House said on Sunday.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be \"very difficult\".\"I think that there's an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement ... but I don't want to overstate it either,\" Rubio said during a visit to Hungary on Monday. \"It's going to be hard.\"",

    "body": "Austrian ski jumper Daniel Tschofenig said he felt \"extremely stupid\" after being disqualified from the men's large hill individual event for wearing oversized boots.Tschofenig, 23, had comfortably qualified for Saturday's final but his Winter Olympics medal hopes were dashed due to an error with his kit.The 2025 World Cup champion was found to be wearing boots that were four millimetres larger than the rules permitted.\"I used new shoes in training which, by the way, I wasn't very happy with, but I kept them,\" Tschofenig said.\"Unfortunately, I was naive and didn't measure it. Extremely stupid of me, there was just so much stress going on. But rules are rules.\"Tschofenig had scored 137.7 in the first round but his rule breach led to an immediate disqualification and handed Slovakia's Hektor Kapustik a route through to the final.Slovenia's Domen Prevc went on to win gold with Ren Nikaido of Japan taking silver and Poland's Kacper Tomasiak picking up bronze.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry SekulichAFP via Getty ImagesA memorial was laid out for Alex Pretti a day after he was shot deadOfficials in the US state of Minnesota say the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has refused to co-operate with its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti.US Customs and Border Protection agents shot dead the 37-year-old intensive care nurse during a protest against immigration enforcement in the city of Minneapolis on 24 January.Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) has accused the FBI of failing to hand over any information and evidence from its investigation into the shooting.BCA Supt Drew Evans called the FBI's actions \"concerning and unprecedented\". The FBI has not yet responded.Minnesota's BCA said it would \"welcome a joint investigation\" with federal officials. \"The BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,\" it said in a statement.Pretti's family has also pushed for a joint investigation, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts. A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development,\" Pretti's family said in a statement.\"It remains unclear if there will be any co-operation or sharing of information related to those two shootings,\" the BCA said.State and federal officials sparred over the course of Operation Metro Surge, an immigration crackdown launched by the Trump administration.It prompted a wave of national protests opposing US President Donald Trump's migration policy and the tactics of ICE.More than 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, according to Homan, including men he said were convicted of rape and other sexual offences.Minnesota's Democrat Governor Tim Walz said the operation left the state with \"deep damage, generational trauma... and many unanswered questions\".",

    "body": "36 minutes agoJessica ParkerBerlin correspondent, BerlinWatch: Hillary Clinton asked about Epstein links and if Andrew should testifyHillary Clinton has accused US President Donald Trump's administration of a \"cover-up\" over its handling of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,\" the former US secretary of state told the BBC in Berlin, where she attended the annual World Forum.The White House insisted that by releasing the files they had done \"more for the victims than Democrats ever have\".Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) earlier this month.At the time, the deputy attorney general said three million pages were not released - due to the existence of personal medical files, graphic depictions of child abuse or other material that would jeopardise investigations.When asked whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should go before a congressional committee, Hillary Clinton said: \"I think everybody should testify who is asked to testify.\"Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing. The committee does not have the power to compel him to appear in front of them, but put pressure on the Clintons to do so, which they agreed to last month.Bill Clinton will make his appearance on 27 February and Hillary Clinton will appear the day before.A planned vote to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for initially refusing to appear was shelved after the pair agreed to testify. It will be the first time a former US president has testified to a congressional panel since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.Hillary Clinton reiterated the couple's call for their congressional committee hearing to be in public rather than a closed-door deposition.\"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,\" Hillary Clinton told the BBC.Republican committee chair James Comer had accused the Clintons of \"delay\", saying the pair \"caved\" as a contempt vote loomed.\"I just want it to be fair,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"I want everybody treated the same way.\"\"We have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly. We think sunlight is the best disinfectant.\"The former presidential candidate argued that she and her husband were being used to divert attention away from Trump.\"Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy.\"Hillary Clinton said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell - Epstein's convicted associate -  \"on a few occasions\".Bill Clinton - who was featured in the Epstein files - was acquainted with Epstein but said he cut off contact two decades ago.Neither Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and both have denied knowledge of his sex offending at the time.The millions of new files relating to Epstein that were made public by the US justice department earlier this month after Congress passed a law requiring the agency to release material related to investigations of Epstein.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited, without the chance of bail, his trial on sex trafficking charges. It came more than a decade after his conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor, for which he was registered as a sex offender.Andrew, the former prince, has faced growing pressure from some US officials and the family of his prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre to testify before the Oversight Committee about his links to Epstein.Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 containing no admission of liability. Giuffre died by suicide in 2025.Trump - who is mentioned in the Epstein files - has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.When asked about Hillary Clinton's comments in the interview, Trump told the BBC he had nothing to hide.\"I've been exonerated. I had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. They went in hoping that they'd find it, and they found just the opposite,\" he said aboard Air Force One.\"They're getting pulled in. And that's their problem... Clinton and many other Democrats have been pulled in.\"In relation to the allegations against Trump, the DoJ has previously said: \"Some docs contain untrue and sensationalist claims against Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear the claims are unfounded and false and if they have any shred of credibility they certainly would have been weaponised against Trump already.\"The White House said: \"By releasing thousands of pages of documents, co-operating with the House Oversight Committee's subpoena request, and President Trump recently calling for further investigations into Epstein's Democrat friends, the Trump Administration has done more for the victims than Democrats ever have.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoTommy Lumby,Business data journalistandPhil Leake,Data journalistBBCWages have been rising faster than prices for the last two-and-a-half years - the longest stretch since the 2008 financial crisis.Use our calculator below to see how your pay could be affected.Tax thresholds are the points at which you start paying more income tax and National Insurance on each extra pound you earn, as your salary rises.You pay no income tax on the first £12,570, which is known as the personal allowance.You then pay 20% on earnings between £12,571 and £50,270 - the basic rate - and 40% on anything between £50,271 and £125,140, which is the higher rate. Anything above £125,140 is taxed at 45%.If you earn more than £100,000 after accounting for certain tax reliefs, you start to lose £1 from your personal allowance for every £2 you earn over that point.Governments have historically raised tax thresholds in line with inflation, to try to ensure your take-home pay keeps up with the cost of living.Weekly earnings across Britain grew at an annual rate of 0.8% between October and December after accounting for inflation, the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows.That means growth in average salaries has now consistently beaten the pace of price rises since July 2023.But thresholds have been frozen for the whole of that period and will remain stuck into the next decade.According to our calculations, the freeze in thresholds will add £465 to the 2030-31 income tax and National Insurance bill for someone currently earning £39,000, which is the salary of the average UK worker.Of that, £227 would be due to the extended freeze announced by the current Chancellor Rachel Reeves in November.Someone on £50,000 would pay an estimated £1,309 more, of which £704 would be because of the extension from 2028-29.You can read more about how the calculator works in the final section of this article.Freezing thresholds is often called a stealth tax by economists because it increases the tax take without a government having to put up rates.Both Labour and Conservative governments have used it to raise additional revenue. Extra money from tax receipts helps pay for public services such as the NHS, schools and welfare spending.Most earners will pay more because of the freeze. But people whose pay rises move them across the thresholds into the basic and higher rates are likely to see the biggest jumps in what they owe.But this only goes up to 2028-29, so does not include the period covered by the extended freeze.Thresholds were initially frozen in 2022 by former Conservative Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who paused them until 2026.The Conservatives later extended that for a further two years, before Reeves announced she would keep it in place until 2031.By 2030-31, official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates an additional 5.2 million people will be paying the basic rate of income tax because of threshold freezes first introduced in 2022-23.An estimated 4.8 million more will be paying the higher rate, and 600,000 more the additional rate.It forecasts that the freezes to income tax thresholds will generate £56bn in revenue in 2030-31. Of that, £12bn will be down to Reeves's extension.Additional reporting by Lucy Dady and Jess CarrHow the calculator worksThis calculator estimates how much extra tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs) you will pay in 2030-31 due to frozen tax thresholds.Using official forecasts produced by the OBR for the November 2025 Budget, it estimates the extra amount you could pay compared with if thresholds had been allowed to rise from 2026-27, and how much of that is down to the current government's extension of the freeze from 2028-29.The calculator does not store your results.What does the calculator not take into account?This calculator is designed to give you an idea of how much frozen tax thresholds could affect how much tax you pay over time, but there are various other factors that can determine your tax bill.For example, if you are over the state pension age, you could be exempt from paying NICs. You can also get tax relief on pension contributions.There are various other taxes you could pay, and tax credits and allowances you could potentially claim, which this calculator does not take into account.It applies to employees working in England, Wales and Northern Ireland only. Scotland has different tax bands and thresholds.It does not apply to self-employed workers, who are taxed differently.How does it calculate how my earnings will rise?It assumes your salary will rise in line with the OBR's financial year forecasts for average weekly earnings growth each year. These forecasts are the OBR's best estimate of how wages across the labour market will rise in the future, and actual wage growth could be different.It also assumes your salary remains regular. If it fluctuates or you change jobs, this could affect how your earnings rise.How does it calculate how tax thresholds will rise?The calculator uses the same Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation figures the OBR uses to estimate how tax thresholds would rise in the future. Actual inflation could be higher or lower.The personal allowance (PA) is rounded up to the nearest £10, and the basic rate limit is rounded up to the nearest £100. The additional rate threshold rises in line with the PA, which means your PA goes down by £1 for every £2 you earn over £100,000.",

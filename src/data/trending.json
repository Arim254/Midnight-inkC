    "body": "Andrew Rosindell has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Reform UK.The former shadow minister and MP for Romford said the Tories were \"irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments\" and not willing to take \"meaningful accountability\" for poor decisions. He said he had spoken to Nigel Farage on Sunday evening before agreeing to join his party. The Reform UK leader called him \"a great patriot\" who \"will be a great addition to our team\".A Conservative source said Rosindell's departure was a prime example of Farage doing Badenoch's \"spring cleaning\" and that Reform was \"welcome\" to him.Rosindell's move comes after Robert Jenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after being sacked from the shadow cabinet by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had accused him of plotting to defect.The 59-year-old, who was shadow minister for foreign affairs before his resignation, said in a statement on X that the \"views and concerns of constituents such as mine in Romford have been consistently ignored for far too long\".\"Our country has endured a generation of managed decline,\" he added. \"Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain.\"Rosindell becomes Reform's seventh MP and the third sitting Conservative MP to join the party, following Danny Kruger and Jenrick.This week's defections mean that - putting aside independent MPs, who do not vote in a block - Reform UK now has the joint fifth biggest party grouping in the Commons, alongside Sinn Fein which does not send any of its seven MPs to Westminster. It is two MPs behind the fourth biggest party, the SNP.About 20 former Tory MPs have switched their allegiance to Reform UK, including former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who did so a week ago.Shadow Welsh secretary Mims Davies told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour that Conservative MPs defecting to Reform were \"self-serving and completely wrong\".\"I do find this very confusing that these people who are saying they want to put things right, want to be right-wing, but ultimately there's a lot in Reform which is very left-wing and obviously populist,\" she said.\"I really don't think that arguing that Britain is failing helps people. People want to know, yes things are wrong but the people they've elected are willing to roll up their sleeves and get themselves up to what needs to be fixing rather than looking self-serving.\"Rosindell has held the Romford seat in east London since 2001, although his majority was cut from 17,893 to just 1,463 at the last general election.After switching to Reform, he cited the Labour government's decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and the \"failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition to actively hold the government to account on the issue\" as among the reasons for his defection.\"Both the government and the opposition have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power,\" he said.Farage said: \"The Tories' lies and hypocrisy over the Chagos Islands betrayal has tipped him over the edge, and we are delighted to welcome him to our ranks.\"The move comes hours after the Reform leader insisted his party was \"not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and would not become the Conservative Party 2.0.Reform will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May, he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.A Conservative source said Rosindell had been \"threatening to defect for months, denying it was happening as recently as Saturday\". They added: \"We're not going to be distracted from holding this disastrous Labour government to account.\"The Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The stench of a failed and dying Tory Party now engulfs Reform.\"Nigel Farage is now unconditionally trying to rehabilitate their disastrous record,\" she added. \"The public won't be fooled: the Tories failed Britain and Reform want to do it all over again.\"A Liberal Democrat source said the defection was \"a change of rosette for a career politician worried about getting a P45\", adding: \"The public are fed up hearing about how Britain is broken from the very same people who broke it.\"Jenrick told a news conference where he announced his defection to Reform that the Tories \"broke\" the country and had \"betrayed its voters\", with the UK now \"in decline\". He later told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that the country needed a \"new and exciting\" leader \"who hasn't been part of that failed consensus\".Badenoch called it a \"good day\" for the Conservatives and said Jenrick was \"now Nigel Farage's problem\".She wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was destined to fail as it welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" she said.Correction - an earlier, breaking news version of this story incorrectly stated that Rosindell was the seventh Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK. He is actually the third sitting Conservative to switch allegiance, and takes the number of Reform UK MPs to seven.",

    "body": "3 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA massive fire that tore through a shopping centre in Pakistan's largest city has killed 14 people, including a firefighter, and rescuers are racing to find dozens more still missing.It took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul Plaza that started Saturday night. The building housed 1,200 stores and spanned 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft). Parts of the building have collapsed, with officials saying the debris and lack of ventilation were hampering rescue efforts.\"Almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\", by the time rescuers arrived at the site on Saturday night, local emergency services said.Fifty-eight people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the fire spread rapidly because of the presence of flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, and perfume in the building.By Sunday evening, various parts of the Gul Plaza were charred and reduced to rubble. Rescuers told Reuters news agency that the whole building could come down.Cranes have been deployed to shift what remains of the partially collapsed building, in the hope of recovering more bodies. However, rescuers are still waiting for the structure to sufficiently cool down so they can conduct a thorough search.At least 26 of those reported missing were last seen inside the building, according to the locations of their phones, a police official told the BBC.ReutersIt took firefighters more than 24 hours to put out the blaze in Gul PlazaZain, a shopkeeper at Gul Plaza, told BBC Urdu that hundreds of people were inside the building when the fire broke out on Saturday.\"My shops were burning before my eyes. We couldn't even get the goods out of those shops. \"There are still many people inside, I have many friends who are out of contact,\" he said.Another onlooker said shopkeepers had tried to use fire extinguishers, but the intense blaze was uncontainable. Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporter,andDaniel De Simone,investigations correspondent ReutersThe government has abandoned a final debate on its Hillsborough Law following a backlash from campaigners and some Labour MPs over the extent to which it would apply to intelligence officers.The draft legislation creates a legal obligation for public authorities to co-operate with and tell the truth to inquiries.But a government amendment would have made co-operation by intelligence officers with inquiries subject to the approval of the head of their service.Bereaved families say MI5 and MI6 officers should be fully subject to the proposed law and point to a series of cases where MI5 has provided false information.The government had originally pulled just the amendment from a vote, due to be held on Monday, before it scrapped the entire third reading of the bill - when a draft law is tidied up before going to the Lords.A government spokesperson said it would continue to work with all parties to strengthen the bill \"without compromising national security\".Removing the amendment was earlier welcomed by the Hillsborough Law Now campaign group, which said it would \"engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security\".The proposed law - named after the football stadium in Sheffield where a deadly crush occurred in 1989 - aims to make public authorities and officials more accountable for failings.The government argued that its amendments on the intelligence services sought to balance the law's new duties with protecting national security.Ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Labour MPs, with around 30 backing a proposal by Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne that would ensure the legislation applied in a fuller way to intelligence officers.The government could still bring forward revised amendments when it reaches the House of Lords.Byrne - a long-standing campaigner for the law - told the BBC after the amendment was shelved: \"I think there's been an acknowledgement that their amendment was heading for defeat, and thank God they've withdrawn it.\"However, he added: \"I won't vote for any law to leave the Commons until myself and the families are happy with what it contains...\"I have spoken to some families, and they are absolutely firm that it has to be the full Hillsborough Law before it leaves the Commons.\"It is understood that Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee did not support the government's proposed amendment, posing an additional problem for ministers, because their amendment had proposed an oversight role for the ISC.It is also understood that, amid increasing government concern about a rebellion, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum was personally involved in speaking to some MPs.The draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, is designed to stop cover-ups and would place the same \"duty of candour\" on public officials.However, campaigners had argued that giving those leading the intelligence services approval over disclosures would allow them to choose what could be made public, and said they could not support the bill in its current form.Families bereaved by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack had also called for the law to apply fully to the intelligence services.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.The Labour mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham, had also criticised the government's amendment, saying it created \"too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation\".A government spokesperson said: \"This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve, and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.\"The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.\"Earlier, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she was confident the government would be able to resolve disagreements over the bill before Monday's vote.She insisted security services would not be exempt from the legislation but said ministers faced the challenge of ensuring officers, who often held confidential information, could continue to do their jobs.Nandy added the government wanted to make sure \"we never ever end up in a situation like we did with the Manchester Arena inquiry... where the security services are able to withhold information and present an inaccurate picture to families and to a public inquiry for a very long time\".The Hillsborough Law is the result of campaigning by families affected by the stadium crush, which led to the death of 97 football fans.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about the disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe fallout from Donald Trump's tariff threat to EU allies that oppose his campaign to annex Greenland dominates Monday's papers. The Guardian says European leaders are considering a plan to levy tariffs €93bn of US goods in response. The paper says Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had a call with Trump to tell his economic attack on Nato allies was wrong.The Times focuses on the UK's role in all this and highlights that Sir Keir Starmer will give an \"emergency speech\" later today under the headline 'PM warns of downward spiral in US tariffs row'.The Financial Times follows with details that the possible retaliatory tariffs are being drawn up to give European leaders leverage in crucial meetings with the US president at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.\"Europe delivers a warning to Trump\" echoes the Independent. Elsewhere, the paper  fills its picture slot with a fist-pumping Emma Raducanu after she began her campaign at the Australian Open with a decisive win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew. Raducanu is a popular picture choice on many of the front pages and the Daily Express accompanies its image of her celebrating victory with the headline \"Smiling Emma wins after slow start Down Under\". Its lead story, like most others, is about the tariffs and it focuses on Europe's warning that Trump's threat \"will rip Nato apart\". It also quotes Russia's response to the row, hailing it as a \"collapse of the transatlantic union\".\"Nato now 'heading for disaster' in Trump row\" is the Daily Mail's take, as the paper says Western leaders are warning the US president that his threat risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" in relations.The i Paper calls row the \"biggest crisis\" to hit the Nato alliance in decades and its \"greatest threat\".The Daily Mirror's headline sums up the fallout as \"Trump's Greenland madness\" and spotlights Lib Dems leader Sir Ed Davey urging the King to axe his planned US state visit in April, saying the UK \"must not be a doormat for an extortionist\". In other news, a new survey reveals tea breaks are becoming a thing of the past for millions of workers, with only half leaving their desk to go to the loo and a third rarely leaving their workspace, Metro reports.Need an antidote for Blue Monday, measured as the day with the lowest public mood of the year? Well the Daily Star gives us news that Bez, whom it joyfully describes as a \"dancing maracas star\", will be heading back on the road in March as part of a 35-year anniversary tour with the rock band Happy Mondays. \"Don't worry... Bez happy\" is the headline as the paper pledges to \"cheer you up every day of the week\".Finally, the Sun reports on the news that former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson and her fiancé Zion Foster have split up after four years together. \"Fears Trump's tariffs threat will rip Nato apart\", is how the Daily Express lays bare the divisions surrounding the US president's plan to take over Greenland. The Daily Mail says the prime minister delivered an \"unprecedented rebuke\" to Trump, when he told him that applying tariffs to Nato allies was \"wrong\".The Times says Sir Keir Starmer is opting to take a \"damage-limitation approach\" in the hope that a \"carve out\" from the tariffs can be negotiated, as was the case last year when the US unveiled sweeping trade levies. The i Paper suggests the challenge facing the prime minister is stark, saying he is in an \"11th hour scramble to save the UK-US relationship\".\"Blackmail\", is the accusation levelled at Trump in the Daily Mirror's headline. The paper quotes the call by the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey, for the government to cancel the King's state visit to the US in April. He says \"the UK must not be a doormat for an extortionist\". The Daily Star's editorial agrees, suggesting \"publicly bruising Trump's ego might be the best way to get the US president to take a step back and think\".The i Paper reports that water company bosses could be fined from their own pockets for issues such as sewage spills under a new industry regulator. A White Paper that sets out plans to reform regulation of the sector will be published by ministers this week. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds, tells the i that bosses will have \"nowhere to hide\".The Daily Telegraph describes Andrew Rosindell's defection from the Conservatives to Reform UK as a \"major blow\" to Kemi Badenoch. The paper says he is the fourth sitting MP to make the move after Lee Anderson, Danny Kruger and Robert Jenrick. The Daily Mail points out that Rosindell's defection will \"renew claims\" that Reform is home to too many Tories and \"not seen as a radical new movement\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is widely expected to call for a snap election, less than three months after taking office, in a bid to shore up greater support.Unnamed officials told local media Takaichi would announce the date of the lower house election at a press conference on Monday afternoon. Japanese voters would then elect the 465 members of the House of Representatives, the lower and more powerful house in Japan.Takaichi and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most out of any party.The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party has just enough seats for a majority in the lower house.A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi, Japan's first female leader, is known as the country's \"Iron Lady\".In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she made comments suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan.The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.On domestic policy, Takaichi is an advocate for heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\".As of December, Takaichi and her administration have charted approval ratings of 60-80% in major polls.But her snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition. Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed a new centrist party with the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner, last week. The new party, the Centrist Reform Alliance, will challenge the LDP in the upcoming election.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "Wayne Rooney says Manchester United's younger fans got a \"taste of what it was like under Sir Alex Ferguson\" during their 2-0 win over Manchester City - and hopes it is a glimpse of what is to come under Michael Carrick.Carrick, 44, was appointed as United's interim head coach on Tuesday until the end of the season, replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.Goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu secured a deserved victory over Pep Guardiola's City on Saturday at a raucous Old Trafford.Rooney, who won five Premier League titles alongside Carrick at United, thinks there was a big difference in the home crowd under the leadership of his former team-mate. \"I wasn't at the stadium, I was in the BBC studios, but did you see the difference in the stadium? Even when he [Michael Carrick] walked out before the game and he's trying to pump the crowd up,\" Rooney said on the latest edition of BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show.\"I think the fans felt something yesterday. They got a taste of what it was like under Sir Alex Ferguson. Some of the young fans who have been through a terrible time over the last 10, 13 years, really, since Fergie left. \"They haven't witnessed a team perform that well. I've been part of some of those teams as well. I've played in some of them. \"They haven't witnessed a team perform that well, with that energy and that belief in their fighting and being brave with the ball, but also being resilient and tough to play against. \"Them fans felt that yesterday and hopefully that's a glimpse of what we've got coming in the next 16 games.\"After a goalless first half, Cameroon forward Mbeumo - returning from Africa Cup of Nations duty - fired United in front, with Dorgu doubling the lead 11 minutes later.  Rooney said it was the \"best performance\" he had seen from United in a long time.\"I think what Michael has done with the team wasn't rocket science. It was a simple tweak in terms of what he'd done in terms of formation,\" the former England striker said.\"I think everyone's been talking a lot about Ruben Amorim's formation in the back three and how it suited Man United as well.\"So he changed that, but if you go back to the last podcast we'd done when I spoke about what United need to do, it's simple really, it's run and work hard. It was so refreshing to see the players do that. \"I thought Amad and Dorgu on the wings were excellent, the work-rate they put in to help the full-backs out and they got into a compact shape, which I spoke about, and hit Man City on the break.\"Amorim was dismissed on 5 January and Rooney said United's win over City was \"night and day from what we've been seeing\" under the Portuguese.Rooney added: \"You can feel it from the fans as well, the difference in energy from the team, the confidence, the belief, the composure on the ball at the right times. \"It was night and day from what we've been seeing, so it was such a good day. It reminded me, when we talk about Man United's DNA, that was it... \"Work hard, run for your team-mate, get back into shape, be hard to play against - [and then] when you get an opportunity run forward.\"",

    "body": "Just nowHarry Sekulich,BBC News,Guy Hedgecoe,MadridandRachel Hagan,BBC NewsFootage shows emergency workers at scene of derailmentAt least 39 people have died in a train collision in southern Spain and dozens more have been injured in the country's worst rail crash in more than a decade, Spain's Civil Guard has said.Carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks, colliding with an oncoming train in Adamuz on Sunday evening.Four hundred passengers and staff were onboard both trains, the rail networks said. Emergency services treated 122 people, with 48, including five children, still in hospital. Of those, 11 adults and one child are in intensive care.Spanish Transport Minister Óscar Puente said the death toll \"is not yet final\", as officials launched an investigation.Puente described the incident as \"extremely strange\". All the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\", he told reporters in Madrid.Rail network operator Adif said the collision happened at 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT), about an hour after the train left Málaga heading north to Madrid, when it derailed on a straight stretch of track near the city of Córdoba.The force of the crash pushed the carriages of the second train into an embankment, Puente said. He added that most of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the second train, which was travelling south from Madrid to Huelva.The type of train involved in the crash was a Freccia 1000, which can reach top speeds of 400 km/h (250 mph), a spokesperson for the Italian rail company Ferrovie dello Stato told Reuters news agency.Rescue teams said the twisted wreckage of the trains made it difficult to recover people trapped inside the carriages.Córdoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.Footage from the scene appears to show some train carriages had tipped over on their sides. Rescue workers can be seen scaling the train to pull people out of the lopsided train doors and windows.A Madrid-bound passenger, José, told public broadcaster Canal Sur: \"There were people and screaming, calling for doctors.\"ReutersPassengers were taken to hospital and advanced medical posts near the site of the crashAll rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and are expected to remain closed all day on Monday.Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Málaga, said around 300 passengers were on board the train that first derailed, while the other train – operated by the state-funded firm Renfe – had around 100 passengers.The official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month, according to the transport minister. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident, describing it as \"a nightmare\".King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.The emergency agency in the region of Andalusia urged any crash survivors to contact their families or post on social media that they are alive.EPAFriends and relatives have been seeking information about their loved ones on board either train.Advanced medical posts were set up for impacted passengers to be treated for injuries and transferred to hospital. Adif said it set up spaces for relatives of the victims at Atocha, Seville, Córdoba, Málaga and Huelva stations. The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told RNE radio: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"ReutersThe foyer of the hospital close to the crash site, Caseta Municipal in Adamuz, filled with affected passengers.French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have published statements offering condolences. \"My thoughts are with the victims, their families and the entire Spanish people. France stands by your side,\" Macron wrote on social media.In 2013, Spain suffered its worst high-speed train derailment in Galicia, north-west Spain, which left 80 people dead and 140 others injured. Spain's high-speed rail network is the second largest in the world, behind China, connecting more than 50 cities across the country. Adif data shows the Spanish rail is more than 4,000km long (2,485 miles).Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "16 hours agoGuy LambertCulture reporterThe BBC has called on the makers of The Apprentice to carry out stricter background checks on contestants, after one due to appear on the forthcoming series was found to have made offensive posts on social media.The messages from candidate Levi Hodgetts-Hague included discriminatory remarks towards Muslims and sexist comments about women, according to the Sun on Sunday, which first revealed the posts. Naked, the production company behind the award-winning show, said social media checks had \"failed to flag the offensive posts\", and that the process would be reviewed.Hodgetts-Hague has apologised for the posts, which have subsequently been deleted.The messages from Hodgetts-Hague, from South Yorkshire, are said to have included attacks on Islam and used derogatory language to refer to women.In other published posts from 2013 he reportedly expressed support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.BBC News has not seen the posts following the closure of the candidate's social media account.A BBC spokesperson said the views presented in the posts were \"totally unacceptable\" and the organisation was taking this \"extremely seriously\".\"We were completely unaware that this contestant had made such abhorrent comments,\" they said.\"We have asked the independent production company to fully review the social media checks undertaken given the process has clearly failed in this instance.\"The show presented by Lord Sugar is set to launch its 20th series on 29 January in which 20 candidates will compete for the chance to win £250,000 and go into business with the tycoon.Filming concluded in 2025, meaning Hodgetts-Hague will still appear in the programme.In a statement issued to The Sun on Sunday, Hodgetts-Hague said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" by the posts he made more than a decade ago.\"I offer my sincere apologies to all who I've offended, as well as my fellow candidates, for the truly awful language and views that they contain,\" he said.\"I take full accountability for the publishing of those posts. They are not a reflection of the values I uphold today.\"I would like to apologise for my actions, as well as to the production team for failing to bring this account to their attention.\"Production company Naked said it worked with \"reputable third-party providers\" to carry out comprehensive background and social media checks on all candidates.This is part of the company's \"rigorous due diligence\" before casting, a spokesperson said.\"On this occasion, these checks failed to flag the offensive posts, therefore we will be reviewing this process moving forward.\"\"Levi's historical posts contain language which is unacceptable and Levi has been spoken to about this behaviour,\" they added. \"He has apologised and insists that these posts do not reflect the man he is now.\"Earlier this week, a separate former Apprentice contestant, Dr Asif Munaf, was struck off the medical register after a tribunal found he posted antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media.Munaf, a candidate on series 18 in 2024, posted or reposted a total of 36 \"seriously offensive\" comments on X between October 2023 and July 2025.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

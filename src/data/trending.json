    "body": "What growing up in war does to a child's brain - and how it really affects them years later22 hours agoFergal KeaneSpecial correspondent BBCContent warning: this article includes details about the impact of conflict on children in war zones and descriptions of injuries that some readers may find distressing.The first thing was that Abdelrahman's dad was killed. The family home was struck by an Israeli air strike. The boy's mum, Asma al-Nashash, 29, remembers that \"they brought him out in pieces\".Then on 16 July 2024 an air strike hit the school in Nuseirat, central Gaza. Eleven-year-old Abdelrahman was seriously wounded. Doctors had to amputate his leg.His mental state began to deteriorate. \"He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard,\" Asma recalls. \"He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone.\"When I meet Abdelrahman at a hospital in Jordan in May 2025, he is withdrawn and wary. Dozens of children have been evacuated to the Kingdom from Gaza for medical treatment.\"We will return to Gaza,\" he tells me. \"We will die there.\"Abdelrahman is one of thousands of traumatised children I've met in my nearly four decades of reporting on conflicts. Certain faces are embedded in my memory. Some as though I had only met them yesterday. They reflect the depth of terror inflicted on children in our time.AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesHundreds of thousands of children have lived through more than two years of war in GazaThe first was on a hilltop in Eritrea in the mid-1980s. Adonai Mikael was a child victim of an Ethiopian napalm strike, crying in agony as the wind blew dust on to his wounds. The cries, the expression of pure agony in his eyes sent me fleeing from the tent where he was being treated. In Belfast a few years later, I remember a boy following the coffin of his father, blown up by the IRA. Never before had I seen such a distance in anyone's eyes.In Sierra Leone during the civil war, there was the girl whose hands were hacked off by a drunken militiaman; from Soweto there is the image of a child helping her mother mop the blood of a murder victim on their doorstep; and in Rwanda the boy who broke down when I asked him why the other children called him \"Grenade\" – a moment of insensitivity I will always regret.He had been wounded by an explosion that killed his parents.Figures underscore the sheer scale of the crisis. In 2024, 520 million children were living in conflict zones - one in every five children worldwide - according to an analysis by the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which pieced together conflict records with population data to arrive at the estimate.Prof Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light, a book about former child soldiers, calls this \"the largest humanitarian disaster since World War Two\".She warns trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future. \"[It can affect] the developing architecture of the brain in young children, with lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health.\"But given how much time has been spent researching the impact of war on children's minds, what can help?This is a question that has never been more relevant following this period of multiple global conflicts that have affected millions of children: from those Sudanese children who, in October, saw their mothers and sisters raped by militiamen in el-Fasher, Darfur; the youngsters abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, many having witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours; the children of Bucha in Ukraine whose parents were among the people massacred by Russian troops in February 2022; and the hundreds of thousands of children like Abdelrahman who have endured more than two years of war in Gaza.AFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesSudanese refugees in 2025I should declare a personal interest. I suffered from post traumatic stress disorder – PTSD both as a child in a broken home, and later as an adult, witnessing war and genocide. Though different from experiencing war as a child, I know the symptoms all too well: the extreme anxiety, hypervigilance – being constantly on guard against threats - flashbacks, nightmares, and depression. The symptoms were severe enough to require several hospitalisations.Personal experience has made me intensely curious about how children respond and are treated.\"The evidence is quite solid across different studies that the exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Michael Pluess, a professor of psychology at the University of Surrey.He has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptions. \"It's important to recognise that children differ in how they respond.\"A variety of factors can influence the outcome. How long was the child exposed to the traumatic events? Were they physically wounded? Did they lose an important person in their life, or see them killed or injured? Did they have physical security and emotional support in the aftermath?In a sample of 2,976 children from Bosnia-Herzegovina - all of whom had been exposed to war and were aged between nine and 14 - high levels of post-traumatic symptoms and grief symptoms were reported.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGetty ImagesBosnia-Herzegovina: Children in SarajevoBut there is the potential for long-term health damage – heart disease, autoimmune problems - linked to \"toxic stress\", where the body is flooded with hormones like cortisol and catecholamines, which produce adrenaline.There is also a developing field of research into epigenetics, which asks whether the experience of trauma by one generation can show up in later generations through changes in the way our genes behave.Are we more susceptible to, say, poor mental health, addictions or other health problems if our families have a history of trauma - and how much has this to do with genetics versus our family setups and everyday lives?The family drip-feed effectEpigenetics is a tentative and debated area of scientific research with much still to be learned.\"I think there is some evidence that there is a sort of intergenerational transmission of trauma,\" says Prof Pluess. \"Some of that or much of that will happen through social practice rather than biological practice, but there's some evidence to suggest that there are some epigenetic factors as well.\"Prof Metin Başoğlu, director of the Istanbul Centre for Behavioural Sciences, is sceptical. However, he says it is possible that certain temperament traits (for example, predispositions that are transmitted genetically across generations) might make some people more vulnerable to traumatic events.During research for a book on my own PTSD, I remember a conversation with one of Britain's most eminent experts in the field, Prof Simon Wessely, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. I wondered whether my own family history – great-grandparents born during the Irish famine, a grandmother who was traumatised by her war experiences in the 1920s – could have made me more genetically predisposed to PTSD?\"There is simply no way of knowing, without studying a representative sample group from the same area, with ancestors born in the same place and subjected to the same conditions,\" he told me. \"I can't do it on one person…\"What I think is much easier to understand - and, I think, is also the most powerful - is the influence of our background. And it's absolutely impossible for you to have grown up in the household that you did, with the interests that you have, for that not to have the same effect on you.\"AFP via Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesProf Pluess has carried out long-term research into the children of Syrian war refugees, and cautions against making assumptionsThere is broader consensus that trauma is a family crisis. It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.Getty ImagesHulton-Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty ImagesFox Photos/Getty Images\"The evidence is quite solid [...] exposure to war and displacement is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems,\" says Prof PluessProf Edgar Jones, of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.Overcoming fear and establishing controlIn my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.Getty ImagesAFP via Getty ImagesGetty ImagesGlobal conflicts have affected millions of children, including the young people abducted from Israel by Hamas on 7 October, 2023, those who witnessed the slaughter of family and neighbours that day, and those dealing with the aftermathIn a paper for the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health journal, a team of Israeli specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.'We were dehumanised'Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"VCG via Getty ImagesMirrorpix/Getty ImagesLiaison/ Getty ImagesGlobal conflicts that have affected millions of children - in 1994, up to 800,000 people were massacred in Rwanda over a period of 100 days Beata was joined by her mother who also survived. Her father had died before the slaughter.Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. \"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocideCreating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.Additional reporting by Harriet WhiteheadTop picture credit: EPA/ShutterstockMore from InDepthBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy, has died aged 35.Her family announced her death in a social media post shared by the John F Kennedy Library Foundation, writing: \"Our beautiful Tatiana passed away this morning. She will always be in our hearts.\"In November, Schlossberg, a climate journalist, announced her diagnosis of an aggressive form of cancer. She said in an essay that she had been given less than a year to live.Schlossberg was the daughter of designer Edwin Schlossberg and diplomat Caroline Kennedy.In an article published last month in The New Yorker titled, \"A Battle With My Blood,\" Schlossberg revealed she had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024, after giving birth to her second child.\"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me,\" she wrote.Schlossberg described the treatments she received, including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, but shared that doctors did not give her a good prognosis.She also wrote of the pain she feared her passing would cause for her family, which has endured multiple personal tragedies. Her grandfather, President Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963 and her uncle, John F Kennedy Jr, died in a plane crash in 1999. Her younger brother, Jack Schlossberg, is running for Congress in New York.\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,\" Schlossberg wrote.\"Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she said.In her essay, Schlossberg also expressed disappointment in her uncle Robert F Kennedy Jr's appointment to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Before her widely-read essay about her diagnosis, Schlossberg forged a successful career as a climate journalist.Schlossberg authored the book \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have\". She also wrote about climate and other beats for the New York Times.In December 2021, she reported on local experiments to harness the energy of the London Underground to provide heat to homes, in an effort to fight climate change.\"I think climate change is the biggest story in the world, and it's a story about everything,\" she told NBC News in 2019. \"It's about science and nature, but it's also about politics and health and business. To me, looking at this as a journalist, it seemed like a really important story to tell.\"\"And if I could help communicate about it, that might inspire other people to get involved and work on the issue,\" she said.",

    "body": "8 hours agoAmy WalkerGelsenkirchen PolicePolice say the thieves used a parking garage to gain access to the branchThieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables, police have said.A police spokesman likened the break-in to the Hollywood heist film Ocean's Eleven, telling AFP news agency it was \"very professionally executed\".During the heist at Sparkasse savings bank in the city of Gelsenkirchen, thieves broke open more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes containing money, gold and jewellery. Gelsenkirchen Police said they became aware of the crime after a fire alarm was set off in the early hours of Monday morning.Currently, no arrests have been made and the perpetrators remain at large.Police said the thieves had used the \"quiet Christmas days\" to rob the building on Nienhofstrasse in the Buer district.Initial investigations suggest they gained access to the bank, and escaped, via an adjacent parking garage.Witnesses have reported seeing several men carrying large bags in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday. Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage, on De-La-Chevallerie-Strasse, early on Monday morning.The hole into the underground vault room was discovered when a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, and police and the fire brigade searched the building.Affected bank customers have been asked to contact Sparkasse bank, which has set up a hotline. Police secured the entrance of the branch on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information.Watch: Bank customers demanded to be let in following heistA message on the bank's website said the branch would remain closed on Tuesday following the break-in.Sparkasse said 95% of customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, so the likelihood they were affected is \"very high\". It added that the contents of each compartment are insured up to €10,300 and told customers to check if they had additional coverage through their home insurance.",

On Tuesday, a third man, 28, from Edgware in north-west London, was also arrested in connection with the incident.Police said the two occupants of the Mercedes had fled on foot.Ralph Belmonte, a resident of Grange Road for 47 years, said a postman discovered the body on the road after having mistaken it for a dummy strapped to the roof of a driving car.\"It was only on his return to drop the rest of the mail off that he saw [the body] on the road and approached it thinking that it might have been a dummy and it could create a problem, an accident,\" Mr Belmonte said.\"And as he went to turn it over, he realised it was actually a body.\"He added: \"It's as safe as anybody's area really, until something like this happens, you know – everything's safe until becomes unsafe.\"It's not an area known for high crime rate, but it can happen anywhere.\"Witness appealDetectives investigating the crash released CCTV images which showed two hooded men dressed in dark clothing on a pavement on foot, with one appearing to be running while carrying a number plate.South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedics treated the pedestrian at the scene but he later died, a spokesperson said. Det Insp Zoe Wilczek, of Kent Police's serious collision investigation unit, said the force was continuing to appeal for witnesses.\"We would like to thank all those who have assisted our investigation so far,\" she said.\"We are urging anyone who witnessed the incident, or saw the vehicle or pedestrian prior to the collision, to contact us.\"We're also asking anyone who may have caught any part of the incident on their dashcams and CCTV, and has not yet got in touch with us, to do so.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "US actor George Clooney, his wife, human rights lawyer Amal and their two children have been awarded French citizenship, the government said. The family's new citizenship was made public in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.Their farm in Brignoles, in the south of France, serves as the family's primary residence. The couple purchased the home in 2021.Didier Brémond, the city's mayor, told local media that their decision to become French citizens was a testament to \"his love for our country\".  He told broadcaster BFMTV that the Clooneys are \"a very simple and very accessible family\". \"Here, he wants to live normally, and that's what he is trying to do,\" he said.In an Esquire magazine interview earlier this year, George Clooney said his family decided to move to France because he was \"worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood\".\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he added.\"We live on a farm in France,\" Clooney told Esquire. \"A good portion of my life growing up was on a farm, and as a kid, I hated the whole idea of it.\"But now, for them, it's like – they're not on their iPads, you know? They have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"In addition to their home in France, George Clooney also owns a home in the UK and in Kentucky, where he was born, according to the New York Times.The Clooneys' twins, Ella and Alexander, were born in London in 2017. Their mother was born in Lebanon and raised in the UK. The Journal Officiel shows Amal Clooney was naturalised under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The adjustment to French life appears to be easier for Amal Clooney and her children than for her husband. George Clooney described his wife and children's French as perfect in a recent interview promoting his new movie Jay Kelly. The actor, however, described his French as \"horrible,\" despite trying to teach himself the language using an app. \"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face, and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French broadcaster Canal+.",

    "body": "Protests and strikes in Iran over inflation and currency devaluation have spread from the capital, Tehran, to several other cities on a third day of unrest.The protests began on Sunday after shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar staged a strike when the Iranian rial hit a record low against the US dollar on the open market.Since then, videos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd. Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets... But people were absolutely not influenced by what the enemy wanted,\" Khamenei said in September.",

The instruction comes after \"chaos\" saw all Eurostar trains from London to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels suspended following a power outage in the Channel Tunnel. Services have resumed but people looking to get away for New Year's Eve could \"suffer 10-hour delays\", the i Paper adds.The Sun leads on Anthony Joshua, after he was injured in a car crash on Tuesday which killed two members of his team. The paper says the British boxer has said \"I feel pain all over my body\", with sources close to Joshua saying he will remain in hospital for the new year.Family and friends rallying around Anthony Joshua is the focus of the Daily Mirror's front page. It reports that the boxer's mother is \"by his side in hospital\" as the 36-year-old recovers from the devastating crash.The front page of the Daily Star asks readers to \"give a littler respect\" to English darts player Luke Littler as his mum, Lisa, \"slams\" his critics. Littler was booed by crowds during and after his win over Rob Cross at the PDC World Championship.The top of the Financial Times' front page has been taken over by cardboard boxes today with a picture and headline reading \"Where do all the boxes go?\" The paper's lead story, however, is concerned with private equity firms that are selling companies to themselves at a \"record rate amid low exit values\". The Daily Telegraph leads with a warning from former SAS commanders that \"Labour will wreck special forces\" if they go ahead with plans to scrap the controversial Troubles legacy act, which gave legal immunity to troops who had served in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the main picture on the front page is of the King, Prince of Wales and Princess Anne dressed up for the Trooping of the Colour earlier this year - one of the pictures chosen by William and Catherine as their favourite moments of 2025.Some police fores are facing ruin, according to the Daily Mail, which has spoken to the head of the National Police Chiefs Council who has predicted crime will surge by up to 6% in just one year. Police chiefs say it is due to Labour's planned justice reforms, including the plan to \"jail fewer offenders by ditching shorter prison sentences and releasing inmates earlier\".Britain has seen the worst investment levels across the G7, the Times says, which has led Labour MPs to accuse Rachel Reeves of \"broken commitments\" and impacting business confidence. Meanwhile, the Timess main picture captures Mona Seif, the sister of Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, campaigning for his release with David Lammy, who is currently deputy PM, in 2022. Millions of people visiting A&E for coughs or hiccups that health leaders blame on a \"primary care crisis\", wins the top slot for the Guardian's front page today. The paper reports that Health Secretary Wes Streeting \"faces pressure to show he is making progress on the NHS\", which it says is \"failing to give patients prompt access to primary care\". In an exclusive, the Daily Express reports on \"meddling Euro judges\" working on Shamima Begum's case. The European Court of Human Rights has reportedly formally challenged Britain's decision to strip her of her citizenship in 2019, which Ms Begum's lawyers have welcomed, the Daily Express says.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "23 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesScroll through social media and you'd be forgiven for thinking saunas and cold plunges are close to a miracle cure, boosting immunity, burning fat and fixing everything from sore joints to low mood.But the reality, experts say, is more nuanced.\"There are a lot of people who swear by hot and cold exposure, but we don't yet have sufficient evidence to say it's categorically good for you,\" says Dr Heather Massey, associate professor of extreme environments and physiology at the University of Portsmouth.She explains our bodies are \"incredible\" at keeping core temperature stable, usually between about 36.5C and 37C.In everyday life, many of us rarely challenge that system, spending long periods in heated or air-conditioned spaces.Heating or cooling the body creates a small stress, she says, which may trigger adaptive or protective responses.The science behind the saunaThat idea underpins the appeal of saunas, which nowadays at gyms and spas are rarely empty.  For some people it's a reward after exercise while for others, it's the main attraction and many regulars swear by it, convinced that 15 minutes of intense heat does wonders for their body and mind. And there's no doubt it can feel good.\"When you sit in a sauna and work up a sweat, you may feel looser, freer, a bit more mobile and your aches and pains may resolve themselves a bit,\" Dr Massey tells the BBC's What's Up Docs podcast.\"So there's definitely some benefit to using the sauna but the question is whether that's a long-term health benefit or more of a psychological one.\"Getty ImagesDr Massey explains that a recent study put people repeatedly in hot tubs and the results showed changes in insulin and blood pressure.\"We're starting to explore whether heating the body could help people living with lifelong conditions.\"Still, she urges caution when it comes to bold health claims as robust scientific evidence is still limited.\"We've never really done a proper sauna trial,\" she says. \"I suspect we'll find benefits in the future, but we're not there yet.\"For now, she says, it's reasonable to enjoy the ritual for how it makes you feel, without assuming it's a guaranteed shortcut to better health.And if you do try saunas or hot tubs, Dr Massey advises caution, \"ease yourself in gradually\" and check with your GP first if you have any underlying health conditions or are pregnant.What about cold water swimming?Some people like to push things in the opposite direction. Cold-water swimming groups are growing in popularity, with early-morning dips now a familiar sight at beaches, lakes and rivers.Dr Massey, who has swum the channel and competed in the world ice-swimming championships, goes cold-water swimming once a week but only spends a couple of minutes in the water. She finds it \"painful\" at first, but that initial shock is exactly what people are chasing.\"When you first immerse, you get an involuntary gasp and rapid breathing,\" she explains. Heart rate and blood pressure jump and stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline surge. \"That response peaks at about 30 seconds and then drops away very quickly,\" she adds.Repeated exposure reduces the shock response and after several short swims, it can be cut by around 50%.As with saunas, the big question is whether the benefits come from the temperature itself, or everything wrapped around it.Cold-water swimming is usually done outdoors and with others. \"It's an activity with multiple mechanisms - nature, movement and social connection and they are all interlinked,\" Dr Massey says.Podcast host Dr Chris van Tulleken agrees it's difficult to separate those factors: \"We don't know if the benefit is the cold water itself or being with a group of fun people and doing something challenging together.\"Find something you enjoyFor Dr Massey, though, the starting point isn't temperature at all, but enjoyment.\"I speak to people who do Parkrun every week, and describe exactly the same kind of buzz as other people get from cold water swimming,\" she says.\"What matters is finding something you enjoy, can do regularly, and ideally can share with others, as building a friendship group around an activity can reduce psychological stress.\"That could be anything from gardening, birdwatching, joining a choir or simply walking with friends. So even if saunas and cold swims are not essential for good health, says Dr Massey, they may still offer something positive.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "A Vietnamese-American astronaut has opened up about her depression after she received a \"tsunami of harassment\" following the first all-female space trip since 1963 earlier this year.Amanda Nguyen - a 34-year-old scientist and civil rights activist - was part of the 11-minute Blue Origin space flight, which also included pop star Katy Perry and Lauren Sánchez, the journalist and wife of Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, among its crew.The much-derided flight was criticised by some for its expense and environmental impact.Speaking about the experience, Ms Nguyen - who became the first Vietnamese woman to go to space - said the backlash saw her dreams buried under \"an avalanche of misogyny\".Watch the moment the Blue Origin rocket launched and landed in April 2025.In a statement posted on Instagram, Ms Nguyen said that when fellow crew member Gayle King - a US news anchor - called to check in on her in the days following the flight, \"I told her my depression might last for years\".She described the news coverage and social media reaction that followed the trip as an \"onslaught no human brain has evolved to endure\".\"I did not leave Texas for a week, unable to get out of bed. A month later, when a senior staff at Blue [Origin] called me, I had to hang up on him because I could not speak through my tears.\"Ms Nyugen, who has worked as a scientist researching women's health and conducted numerous experiments during the Blue Origin flight, said everything she \"had worked for - as a scientist, my women's health research, the years I had trained for this moment, the experiments I operated in space, the history that was being made as the first Vietnamese woman astronaut, on the 50th anniversary of the US-Vietnam war, as the child of boat refugees, the promise I kept to my survivor self [...] were buried under an avalanche of misogyny\".Ms Nguyen is most recognised for her work protecting the civil rights of sexual assault survivors.She put her own ambition to become an astronaut on hold after being raped while at university and pursuing a years-long campaign for justice, she told the Guardian in an interview in March.Eight months on from realising her dream, she said the \"fog of grief has started to lift\", and thanked those who have followed her and sent her good wishes. \"You all saved me\", she said.She added that despite the backlash, \"there has been overwhelming good that has come out of [the flight]\", listing the media attention brought to her women's health research and opportunities to meet world leaders in relation to her advocacy work.Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket lifted off from its Texas launch site in April and took the six-woman crew on an 11-minute flight which crossed the internationally recognised boundary of space.The crew also included aerospace engineer Aisha Bowe and film producer Kerianne Flynn.The New Shepard rocket does not require human operation and is fully automated.Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBilly KenberPolitics investigations correspondentThe British-Egyptian activist at the centre of a political row appears to have endorsed new and baseless claims that he is the victim of a \"smear campaign\". Alaa Abd El Fattah flew to the UK on Friday to be reunited with his family for the first time in 12 years following his release from an Egyptian jail where human rights groups said he had been unfairly detained.The prime minister welcomed his return in a post on X but subsequently faced criticism after old social media posts emerged in which Mr Abd El-Fattah called for the killing of Zionists and police officers.Sir Keir Starmer has since said he was unaware of the \"absolutely abhorrent\" resurfaced posts, which Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised for, and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case\".\"With the rise of antisemitism, and recent horrific attacks, I know this has added to the distress of many in the Jewish community in the UK,\" he added.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has asked a senior civil servant to review why ministers in the current and former governments were not aware of Mr Abd El Fattah's previous comments.Mr Abd El Fattah's apology, which came in a statement issued in the early hours of Monday morning, said that he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.He said the comments were \"expressions of a young man's anger\".The apology was welcomed by the prime minister's spokesman on Monday. He said it was a \"fairly fulsome apology and that's clearly the right thing to do\".However, within hours of his apology, BBC News has established that Mr Abd El Fattah's Facebook account liked another user's post which described criticism of him as a \"relentless smear campaign\" being waged by \"the richest man in the world, a couple of Middle East intelligence services, and a few Zionist organisations\".Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick has  highlighted a second posted liked by Mr Abd El Fattah's Facebook account on the same day which claimed he was a victim of a campaign by Zionists. BBC News has seen a screenshot of this second message but the original post appears to have been deleted.Jenrick said the two posts \"show El Fattah's apology was insincere and scripted\".\"Far from distancing himself from his earlier extremist views, he confirms that he still holds them. Far from showing contrition, he is presenting himself as the victim of a conspiracy,\" he added.He said the posts \"suggest the threshold for revoking his citizenship could be met: he was, and remains, a threat to national security, and his presence in the UK is clearly not conducive to the public good\".The Facebook account belonging to Abd El Fattah had previously shared a photo of him being reunited with his 14-year-old son Khaled on his arrival in the UK.The activist, who has spent more than a decade behind bars, rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising that forced then-Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to resign.In 2021 he was convicted of \"spreading fake news\" for sharing a Facebook post about torture, in a trial that was widely condemned as unfair by human rights groups.He was granted British citizenship in December 2021, while the Conservatives were in power, and was eligible through his London-born mother.Since his old tweets emerged, the Conservatives and Reform UK have called for the government to strip him of his British citizenship and deport him.Although the home secretary has powers to strip a dual national of their citizenship if it is deemed not to be \"conducive to the public good\", in practice this has typically been used in cases linked to terrorism or serious organised crime where someone is deemed a national security threat.It is understood that Downing Street believes that this high bar is not met in this case. Any decision to strip someone of their citizenship is also likely to face a potentially lengthy and expensive legal challenge.The activist had been withdrawn as a nominee for a human rights prize a decade ago over comments he made online about Israel he had posted in 2012.Rail minister Lord Hendy said it was right the government was looking into why ministers were unaware of the messages.\"What he said was clearly quite abhorrent. Nobody would subscribe to that - certainly not the government. And now there is an inquiry by the Foreign Office about how these tweets were overlooked,\" he said.",

    "body": "Israel is to revoke the licenses of 37 aid groups working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, saying they failed to meet requirements under new registration rules.Well-known international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) such as ActionAid, the International Rescue Committee and the Norwegian Refugee Council are among those that will have their licenses suspended on 1 January, with their operations to end within 60 days. Israel said the groups, among other things, had failed to hand over \"complete\" personal details of their staff. The move was heavily criticised by foreign ministers from 10 countries including the UK, who said the new rules were \"restrictive\" and \"unacceptable\".In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the UK, France, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said the forced closure of INGO operations would \"have a severe impact on access to essential services including healthcare\".They added that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remained \"catastrophic\" and  called on Israel's government to ensure INGOs were able to operate \"in a sustained and predictable way\". Israel's Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, which is in charge of registration applications, said the new measures would not impact the flow of humanitarian assistance to Gaza.It added that aid continued to be delivered through \"approved and vetted channels\", including UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian organisations. It said the primary reason aid groups were having their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\". Earlier this month, UN-backed experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas in October, but 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" the following month. Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said the organisations that will be suspended \"did not bring aid into Gaza throughout the current ceasefire\". It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\". The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs said that fewer than 15% of organisations providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework. That framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic stateDenying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisationPromoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against IsraelCalling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in oneSupporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courtsThe Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international organisations - previously warned that the new registration system \"fundamentally jeopardises\" the operations of INGOs in Gaza and the West Bank. \"The system relies on vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles,\" it said.It added: \"While some INGOs have been registered under the new system, these INGOs represent only a fraction of the response in Gaza and are nowhere near the number required just to meet immediate and basic needs.\"According to the Humanitarian Country Team, INGOs currently run or support most of Gaza's field hospitals and primary healthcare centres, emergency shelter responses, water and sanitation services, nutrition stabilisation centres for children with acute malnutrition, and critical mine action activities.In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"Other organisations to be suspended include CARE, Medico International and Medical Aid for Palestinians.

    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed8 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts.

    "body": "1 hour agoBranwen Jeffreys,Education EditorandJohanna ChisholmGetty ImagesThe government says it plans to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.  The measure is expected to be part of a new Schools White Paper, which will be published in full on Monday morning.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the reforms will help end the \"one-size-fits-all system\" which she says has \"denied\" children from disadvantaged backgrounds the same success as their peers.But there are expected to be radical and potentially controversial changes to support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) which would require backing from Labour MPs.The government plans to end the achievement gap between England's richest and poorest school pupils by reforming how schools target funding for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Phillipson has said: \"These reforms are a golden opportunity to cut the link between background and success - one that we must seize.\"She added: \"Our Schools White Paper presents the blueprint for opportunity for the next generation, with an education system that truly serves every child, whatever their needs and wherever in the country they grow up.\"Leaks also suggest one part of the plan due to be announced on Monday will see children with SEND in England have their right to support reviewed as they move through the school system.Children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - which are legal documents outlining their extra support entitlement - will be reassessed after primary school from 2029 as part of a wider system overhaul.The BBC understands this will sit alongside an extension of legal rights to include all children with SEND through school-led Individual Support Plans (ISP).Every child with identified special educational needs, including those who do not currently have an EHCP, will have an ISP drawn up by the school, which will have some kind of legal status.For Hannah Luxford, whose teenage son has anxiety, it took 18 months to get him an EHCP.\"It's an unhelpful, adversarial, complex system that is designed to make you give up,\" Luxford told the BBC.Now, Luxford says her son is thriving at a funded virtual school. But she worries about his legal rights under the new reforms. \"I want to hear that for those of us already with EHCPs that we are protected,\" she said noting how her son's is getting the \"education he deserves\" at the school he currently attends.\"If that's taken away, it will take us back to where we were five years ago.\"Luke Sibieta, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the situation is \"worst of all worlds\" with rising numbers of EHCPs and increasing costs but no better quality for children.\"Unfortunately we still have a system that is characterised by conflict, by fight, but also by really patchy levels of quality.\"The latest GCSE results show the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).It had previously dropped to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between, but it began widening in the post-pandemic years. In the 2022/2023, it reached the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94.",

    "body": "Iran students stage first large anti-government protests since deadly crackdown10 hours agoSiavash Mehdi-Ardalan,BBC PersianandJaroslav LukivScuffles break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Scuffles were later seen breaking out between them and government supporters. A sit-in was held at another Tehran university, and a rally reported in the north-east. Students were honouring thousands of those killed in mass protests in January.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters - many with national Iranian flags - peacefully marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology at the start of a new semester on Saturday.The crowds chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and other anti-government slogans.Supporters of a rival pro-government rally are seen nearby in the video. Scuffles are later seen breaking out between the two camps.Verified photos have also emerged showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Shahid Beheshti University.The BBC have also verified footage from another Tehran university, Amir Kabir University of Technology, showing chanting against the government.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in the north-east, local students reportedly chanted: \"Freedom, freedom\" and \"Students, shout, shout for your rights\".Sizeable demonstrations in other locations were also reported later in the day, with calls for further rallies on Sunday.It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.Last month's protests began over economic grievances and soon spread to become the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people during that wave, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. Hrana also said it was investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.Additional reporting by BBC Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad, and BBC Verify's Richard Irvine-Brown and Shayan Sardarizadeh.",

    "body": "I didn't know I was experiencing burnout until it was too late8 hours agoGeorgia Levy-CollinsBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesLaviai Nielsen won two bronze medals at the 2024 Summer OlympicsYou've just won two Olympic medals, reached the peak of your career so far, you're the strongest you've ever been, right? Wrong.Laviai Nielsen says straight after the 2024 Paris Olympics she felt \"emotionally, psychologically and mentally\" burnt out.Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, the 29-year-old says that once she realised she had burnout it was too late.\"It would take all of my energy to even get out of bed and get to the track,\" she says.\"It felt very unnatural for me, to think: 'Hold on, I need to slow down'.\"Newsbeat has been hearing from young people who say they have experienced burnout for a range of reasons, including unmanageable workload and pressure - with some pushing back key milestones, like saving for a house, as a result.In Nielsen's case, the Team GB sprinter decided to slow down and ended up taking a three-month break.\"It goes against everything you think an athlete should be,\" she says.\"The conversations leading up to the decision were the hardest bit, but once I made that decision, it was so easy.\"Nielsen began representing her country in her teens and won her first senior World Championship medal in 2017.But by the time she'd reached the Paris Olympics, mid-twenties activities - like socialising - became \"exhausting\".Despite competing at a high level athletically, she's not alone in her experience and young people are struggling with burnout in the workplace.Nielsen took three months off to recover from burnout The charity describes burnout as \"a state of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion\". It can build up over a long period of time - meaning it can take a while to recognise.The charity found that while young people are often seen as championing improved attitudes towards mental health at work, many were found to be \"staying silent\" about their own stress.Mental Health UK's 2026 burnout report also highlighted other aspects of life.\"This group is facing pressures both inside and outside work, alongside an uncertain job market where AI is increasingly seen as a threat to some entry-level roles,\" says the charity's chief executive Brian Dow.\"For many, the social contract that rewarded previous generations for hard work is breaking down,\" he adds.Younger workers aged 18 to 24 were second most likely to report stress due to money worries (64%), behind 65% of those aged 25 to 34, who agreed.University students are also struggling, says cognitive behavioural therapist Hannah Paskin.\"We're now getting lots and lots of graduates that can't get into graduate-level type jobs,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"So they're working really hard at university and then basically entering into quite low-paid, not career-oriented jobs.\"HandoutMimi Abbas returned home to family after experiencing burnout at university Mimi Abbas started to experience burnout in her final year of university and struggled with life after graduation.\"You know that you only have a month left of your degree and nothing in you has the spark or motivation to just carry on,\" Abbas says.The 23-year-old then returned home and spent six months applying for jobs, which she describes as a \"really difficult period\".\"It was just never-ending,\" she tells Newsbeat.The Bristol graduate ended up landing a job in the events industry, which she said was \"great\" but \"tiring with long hours\".\"I was going into the office, working, coming home, falling asleep. I didn't really have the energy to see my friends or go to the gym,\" she recalls. \"Any hobbies or passions I had on the side were kind of just put on the side.\"Abbas ended up leaving her corporate role and withdrawing her house savings.She now works part-time jobs in London - and feels better for it.\"I'd rather be happy and not feel so drained all the time,\" she says.@drbeccasalmonDr Becca Salmon said she was relieved when she took a step back from her workplace Dr Becca Salmon began posting about her own burnout after she left her NHS job.\"I look back on videos and pictures of myself from when I was working as a doctor and I look so unwell,\" she tells Newsbeat.The 29-year-old's video about quitting her role as a doctor in January 2024 sparked a big reaction and following.\"I had so much anxiety posting it, but the support and the familiarity from other people towards that was crazy,\" says Salmon.She says it took her six months to a year to fully recover from burnout.\"I think that's what people quite like in my story,\" she adds.\"It's just nice to know that burnout doesn't have to be the end.\"HandoutSpencer Clark has felt burnout trying to pursue his dream role while also working full-timeSpencer Clark, 23, can also relate to feeling burnout when trying to pursue a dream role.He tells Newsbeat he has been building his social media presence as he wants to be an online fitness coach, but is also working a full-time job in the precious metal industry so he can pay the bills. \"I do 12-hour shifts at work and trying to muddle all of them together has just been really hard,\" Clark says.\"My nutrition's on point, I go to the gym, I'm a healthy guy, but I've just overworked myself clearly.\"He says he often sees self-proclaimed \"fitness gurus\" on social media who are encouraging others to reduce their sleep to fit more in, but he believes that's not the answer. While the Mental Health UK report shows a notable number of young people are being affected by burnout, clinical psychologist Dr Claire Plumley says it is not a new issue - it's just \"being talked about a lot more\".She explains that because it's not an official mental health diagnosis, doctors previously weren't using the term, but there is now greater understanding of it. Plumley, who has written a book on how to manage burnout, also notes it doesn't just affect the younger workforce. \"Millennials and Gen X, they'll have better-paid jobs, perhaps, but extra responsibilities,\" she adds.Nicki CameronHannah Paskin says stepping back and slowing down can help ease burnoutHowever, there are aspects of today's digital society which can particularly affect young people, therapist Paskin says.\"From quite a young age, their life has been on social media, through teenage years when we're very impressionable,\" she says.\"A lot of people's default when they can't switch off is to scroll.\"Scrolling in bed before they go to sleep, and first thing when they're getting up.\"Choice overload, particularly for chronically online young people, can also lead to burnout, she adds. Preventing burnout There are things you can do to help prevent burnout, Paskin says.\"It's that desire to step out of the commercial world, step out of all those sorts of bits of life, step back from phone use.\" She suggests that getting breathing space from stress can restore energy, which is something Nielsen is doing.She is back to training and says rest is her top priority.\"We are a society that pride ourselves on continuing to work hard and going higher and pushing higher,\" Nielsen says.\"Rest is not laziness. It's a necessity.\"The professional athlete says that she now has more balance as a result.\"Instead of being solely focused on athletics, I'm making sure that I'm nourishing some things away from the track,\" she adds.Salmon agrees, saying she now limits how much she books in.\"You're definitely not alone and it definitely does get better,\" she says.\"Be kind to yourself, take that rest.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on thisRelated links",

    "body": "8 hours agoGrace DeanBBCPupils at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active\"If I had a pound for every time I said 'tuck your shirt in', I wouldn't need to teach, I'd be a millionaire,\" laments one Derbyshire secondary school teacher.The teacher, who asked us not to use their real name, works at a school with a strict uniform policy, where pupils can end up in detention if they repeatedly forget their tie or paint their nails. Pupils wear a blazer, shirt and tie, which \"look really uncomfortable\".\"We're meant to stand at the door and greet students just to check that they're wearing the uniform correctly and that their shirts are tucked in and they're looking smart and ready to learn,\" the teacher says. \"It just wastes time.\"She says the regular uniform checks are disruptive for pupils and give teachers unnecessary work.Another secondary school in Derbyshire, Alvaston Moor Academy, is now ditching blazers and ties in favour of a black all-weather jacket and polo shirt from September.The teacher we spoke to called the policy \"genius\". \"It looks so comfortable and it looks smart still,\" she says.One teacher called Alvaston Moor Academy's new uniform \"genius\"Currently, learning to tie a tie for secondary school is almost a rite of passage in the UK. In fact, a 2020 study of the uniform policies of every state secondary school in Scotland found that 90% required ties and 66% had blazers.But Alvaston Moor's new uniform appears to be part of a broader movement to introduce more practical school clothing. Proponents say this encourages children to be more active, is more comfortable and makes life easier for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) - but others argue traditional uniforms look smarter and instil discipline.One concern some parents and staff have about traditional school clothing is that blazers, which some schools demand pupils wear at all times, aren't always weather appropriate.'It's a bigger issue than people realise'One Leeds grandmother says her 11-year-old granddaughter is often \"freezing\" at school wearing her blazer, as opposed to a jumper: \"That isn't conducive to children's learning.\"A former teacher in Walsall says the secondary school where she used to work had the opposite problem - pupils usually weren't allowed to take their blazers off, leaving them uncomfortable at times. Mum Laura has a similar issue with her son, who has ADHD and often gets hot and claustrophobic in his formal shirt and tie.Laura's son isn't alone. Traditional school uniforms can often be difficult for SEND pupils.\"It's actually a bigger issue than people realise,\" says Duncan, from Devon, whose teenage daughter is autistic and has sensory processing disorder, which means she is more sensitive to how clothing feels against her skin.His daughter switched schools two years ago, and one of the main reasons was her school's inflexible uniform policy, he says.The teenager found some aspects of her uniform so uncomfortable that they became painful, like the embroidered logo, seams and tag on her polo shirt, her dad says.\"She was refusing school for a long time,\" Duncan says. He says her previous SEND school turned down his proposal that she wear her own T-shirt in the school's colour and black leggings or jogging bottoms.Among primary schools, the push for more practical school uniforms is largely to encourage physical activity and play. More than half of children aged five to 16 weren't meeting the chief medical officer's guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity per day in the 2023-2024 school year, says Sport England.Link to behaviour \"If you were taking your kids out on a Saturday to play, there is no way that you would choose the kind of clothes that we send children to school in,\" says Prof Helen Dodd, who researches children's play at the University of Exeter. \"The clothes that they're wearing are getting in the way.\"A small-scale 2012 study by Australian academics suggested that girls at primary schools were \"significantly more active\" during breaks and at lunchtime when they wore their sports uniform rather than their winter uniform. A 2021 study was less conclusive but suggested that wearing sports uniforms \"may yield small improvements\" in activity levels throughout the day.Academics and parents also push back against some of the main arguments in favour of more traditional uniforms - for example, that they encourage better behaviour and prepare pupils for the world of work.\"The research evidence does not support that smart uniform affects behaviour,\" says Dodd from the University of Exeter.And fewer people are wearing blazers and ties to work after the pandemic led to people dressing more informally for the office. What people wear to the office has \"just gone so casual\" in the past few years, personal stylist Karina Taylor previously told BBC News, attributing this to the rise in remote work.But many people told BBC News they were still in favour of having some kind of uniform to create a sense of community and to stop pupils who couldn't afford the latest trends feeling left out.\"I think you can have a school uniform without it being cumbersome,\" says Duncan, who also has a son who wears a blazer and tie to middle school.'You don't have to wear a uniform to learn'Some schools have already ditched blazers and ties in favour of a more comfortable uniform.A survey of teachers in 2024 by the app Teacher Tapp suggested that fewer secondary school pupils were wearing ties than the previous year.The pandemic affected school uniform policies, as many pupils could wear what they wanted for virtual lessons, says Dr Rachel Shanks of the University of Aberdeen.\"People could see, especially teenagers, you don't have to be wearing a uniform to be learning,\" she says.And after lockdown, some primary schools began letting pupils come in in their sports kits on days they had PE, \"and a lot of schools have kept to that\" after realising pupils were more comfortable, she says.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to what it called an \"always active\" uniform in 2024 with support from Youth Sport Trust. Pupils now wear leggings or jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a hoodie, with black trainers.Head teacher Iain Williamson tells BBC News it was \"one of the best changes\" the school had introduced, with attendance and behaviour improving afterwards.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to an \"always active\" uniform in 2024He reels off the benefits: PE lessons are 20 minutes longer now since pupils don't need to get changed, they don't have to worry about bringing their sports kit, the uniform is quick drying and doesn't need ironing, and pupils are more active in the playground.Many staff members at the school even opt to wear the active uniforms, too, he says.Some schools say less formal uniforms particularly benefit girls.Girls at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active, head teacher Catherine Parker tells BBC News. Since introducing the new uniform, girls play more during break time, she says.Rachel's daughter is in year seven at a secondary school in Cheshire where pupils wear polo shirts with a choice of sweatshirt, jumper or fleece.\"It's really practical, it looks really smart,\" Rachel says.Duncan's daughter's new SEND school doesn't have a uniform.\"She's allowed to wear what she wants and she's comfortable in because there is an understanding there that it makes a big difference to her ability to engage,\" she says.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoOttilie MitchellEPA/ShutterstockIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed and wounded dozens of people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school.The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.Officials in Nangarhar told the BBC that the home of a man called Shahabuddin had been hit by one of the strikes, killing about 20 family members, including women and children.Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "8 hours agoMany of Sunday's papers continue their coverage of the fallout from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on Thursday over suspicion of misconduct in public office. The Sunday Mirror leads with claims from the Royal Family's former head of protection that \"there was a conspiracy of silence\" over the former prince's relationship with disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Such claims prompted calls for an inquiry to discern \"who knew what and when?\" the paper writes.The ex-Royal's protection chief's \"calls to question 'silence' over Andrew scandal\" also leads the Sunday People.The Observer leads with a zoomed-in photograph of Andrew leaving the police station earlier this week, under the headline of \"nowhere to hide\" and \"monarchy in peril\". Former prime minister Gordon Brown \"demands civil servants face questions over taxpayer-funded flights\" used by Andrew to meet Epstein during his time as a \"trade envoy between 2001 and 2011\", the Sunday Telegraph reports. Brown wrote letters to six police forces urging \"a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links Mr Mountbatten-Windsor's government work to Epstein\", the paper says.The Sunday Times says \"Metropolitan police officers were instructed to provide security for a celebrity dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's New York home\", citing newly-released emails. According to the paper, the 2010 dinner party was held in Manhattan to honour Andrew, where \"two royal protection officers from Scotland Yard\" were stationed outside. \"Parliament should decide if Andy & Mandy have committed treason\", reads the Sun on Sunday's headline, leading with Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat's calls for an investigation into Andrew and former ambassador Peter Mandelson. The paper quotes Tugendhat's calls for a \"special committee\" to probe both men's \"links to Jeffrey Epstein\", which \"would have the power to summon witnesses and demand documents\". The Mail on Sunday reports \"King Charles was warned as long ago as 2019 that the Royal Family was being 'abused' by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's business associations\", quoting a whistleblower's emails to Buckingham Palace seen by the paper. It reports the emails tipped off the palace that \"the former Duke had secret financial links to controversial millionaire financier David Rowland\", as the emails \"threaten to draw Charles further into the crisis\". The BBC cannot verify the claims made by the Mail on Sunday and the former prince has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Melvyn Downes, the SAS Who Dares Wins star, leads the Daily Star on Sunday's front page with his criticism of Andrew, calling him \"arrogant and ignorant\". The paper reports that the TV star and author met the then-prince while serving as a soldier in the Staffordshire Regiment. The Independent leads with a \"harrowing dispatch\" from one of its journalists who  travelled to Nikopol, southern Ukraine, marking the four-year anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. \"The only place to hide from Putin's killer drones is our underground school\", reads the headline, featuring a photograph of teachers and students \"using a cellar as a makeshift classroom\".And finally, the Sunday Express leads with Dame Priti Patel's \"mission to save Chagos\". The shadow foreign secretary \"flies into Washington today on a mission to stop the Chagos Islands surrender,\" the paper writes, adding that if she succeeds in brokering a U-turn on the current deal, which Donald Trump opposes, it could cause \"fresh humiliation\" for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The government has said previously that the Chagos Islands deal is \"crucial to the security\" of the UK and allies.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor features prominently on most of the front pages yet again. The Sunday Telegraph reports that former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is calling for police to look into whether the former prince used taxpayer funded jets and RAF bases to meet Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied wrongdoing in relation to his friendship with the convicted sex offender.The front page of the Observer features a zoomed-in photograph of the former prince as he was driven away from a police station last week. Inside the paper says the King has given approval to staff at Buckingham Palace to give police officers investigating his brother on suspicion of misconduct in public office access to files and records, despite courtiers' fears that they \"may reveal a cover-up\". The Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People focus on a call for an inquiry from the Royal Family's former head of protection, Dai Davies, to find out exactly who knew what, and when.According to the Sunday Times, newly released emails suggests Metropolitan Police officers were instructed to provide security for a celebrity dinner party at Epstein's home in New York in 2010. The paper says two royal protection officers from Scotland Yard appear to have been told by the financier's staff to guard the door of his Manhattan townhouse as guests attended the event, held in honour of Andrew.The Sunday Telegraph says UK exporters are \"dismayed\" after President Donald Trump said he would increase his new global tariff from 10 to 15%, less than 24 hours after first announcing the measure. The paper's editorial argues that Trump's decision to \"double down\" on his policy will see the world suffer.The front page of the Sunday Express leads with the shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, flying to Washington as part of what the paper calls her \"mission to save Chagos\". It says that if she succeeds in brokering a U-turn on the current deal to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, which Trump has said he opposes, it could cause \"fresh humiliation\" for Sir Keir Starmer. The government has said previously that the Chagos Islands deal is \"crucial to the security\" of the UK and allies.And most of the papers mark the upcoming four-year anniversary of Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine. \"Kyiv is bloodied but unbowed\", says the Sun on Sunday. The Defence Secretary, John Healey, has written in the Sunday Telegraph that 2026 must be the year that the war ends. The Sunday Mirror carries a call from a 71-year-old grandmother who lives in north-east Ukraine, for the country's children to be able to play in the streets, without running away from every sound.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Tories vow to lower interest on some student loans3 hours agoDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentandHarry SekulichPA MediaConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party would cut the rate of interest charged on some student loans issued in the decade up to 2023.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Badenoch said the Plan 2 loans from that period \"increasingly feel like a scam\". An estimated 5.8 million people took out Plan 2 student loans between 2012 and 2023. The government is under pressure to reduce student debts, including from some Labour MPs, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves has suggested it would be able to cut repayments on loans by lowering inflation.Loan interest is currently charged at the rate of Retail Prices Index (RPI) plus up to 3%, depending on how much a graduate earns.Badenoch said she would cap the interest charged to RPI only, which is currently 3.8%, arguing it would help a higher number of students pay off their debts. The Conservative leader wrote: \"I am horrified at what graduates today are dealing with, and this is one of the reasons millions of young people feel they've been stitched up.\"The Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government introduced Plan 2 loans in 2012 and tripled tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year. The Plan 2 loans were phased out across England in 2023 but still apply in Wales.Repayments for the loan begin once a graduate starts earning above £28,470 at roughly 9% of income earned above the threshold. Payments are largely deducted automatically through the tax system.The government announced the Plan 2 threshold would be frozen at £29,385 for three years from April, 2027.A freeze would mean workers earning above that amount will be dragged into making larger repayments on their student loans than if the thresholds had risen in line with inflation.Reeves defended the measure pledged in the November Budget, describing the student loan system as \"fair and reasonable\". Interest fees will decrease as inflation drops, Reeves said.However, some Labour MPs have criticised the Plan 2 system, including deputy leader Lucy Powell who called it \"unfair\" and \"egregious\" last week.The Liberal Democrats said the situation is \"appalling\" and the whole system needs to be \"rethought\".",

    "body": "14 hours agoJessica RawnsleyWatch: Giant tortoises return to Galápagos island after nearly 200 yearsGiant tortoises are roaming the Galápagos island of Floreana for the first time in more than 180 years, in what conservationists have called a \"hugely significant milestone\".The release of 158 captive-bred juvenile tortoises onto the island is part of the Floreana Ecological Restoration Project led by the Galápagos National Park Directorate.The reintroduction follows a \"back-breeding\" programme launched in 2017 after scientists discovered tortoises carrying ancestry of the Floreana giant tortoise on nearby Isabela island.Floreana's native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction in the 1840s by sailors who took thousands from the island for sustenance during long voyages. \"The restoration of Floreana has reached a hugely significant milestone, with 158 captive-bred giant tortoises released into the wild this week,\" the Galápagos Conservation Trust (GCT) said in a statement on Friday.\"This long-anticipated moment gives hope, not just for the future of Floreana, but for the future restoration of islands around the world,\" it added.Dr Jen Jones, GCT chief executive, described the moment as \"truly spine-tingling,\"  adding that it had validated two decades of collaboration between scientists, charities and the local community.The conservation project became possible after scientists discovered tortoises carrying Floreana ancestry on Wolf Volcano on Isabela island in 2008. Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

at 20.00 ET.Who are the main contenders?One Battle After Another leads the pack with 14 nominations, followed by Sinners, Hamnet and Marty Supreme.Chalamet is bookies' favourite to win best actor but faces competition from DiCaprio, Michael B Jordan (Sinners), Ethan Hawke (Blue Moon), Robert Aramayo (I Swear) and Jesse Plemons (Bugonia).Irish actress Buckley is widely expected to win best actress for playing WIlliam Shakespeare's wife in Hamnet - but Rose Byrne (If I Had Legs I'd Kick You), Renate Reinsve (Sentimental Value), Emma Stone (Bugonia), Chase Infiniti (One Battle After Another) and Kate Hudson (Song Sung Blue) are aiming to cause an upset.Stellan Skarsgård and Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas from Scandinavian family drama Sentimental Value are thought to be the frontrunners for the best supporting actor and actress trophies respectively.Which Brits are flying the flag?Getty ImagesBritish-Nigerian actress Wunmi Mosaku is nominated for best supporting actress for her role in US vampire horror SinnersThe only Brit up for best actor or actress this year is Robert Aramayo for I Swear, the critically-acclaimed biopic of Tourette's campaigner John Davidson.The Hull actor is also one of five actors up for the EE Bafta Rising Star prize.The best supporting actress category has the biggest British contingent, with Wunmi Mosaku (Sinners), Emily Watson (Hamnet) and Carey Mulligan (The Ballad of Wallis Island) all nominated.Scottish veteran Peter Mullan is up for best supporting actor, where his competition includes Skarsgård plus Paul Mescal (Hamnet), Benicio del Toro (One Battle After Another), Jacob Elordi (Frankenstein) and Sean Penn (One Battle After Another).Although the main categories are often dominated by Hollywood, the Baftas have additional categories that specifically recognise UK talent - outstanding British film and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.I Swear, 28 Days Later, Pillion, H is for Hawk, Hamnet and The Ballad of Wallis Island are among the British films acknowledged.And while Wicked: For Good might have been shut out at the Oscars, it did land two Bafta nominations for British creatives - costume design (Paul Tazewell) and make-up and hair (Frances Hannon, Mark Coulier and Laura Blount).What does it mean for the Oscars?If you've got one eye on the Oscars next month, the Baftas might give you a clue as to who might pick up the top acting prizes Stateside.All of Bafta's acting winners for the past two years went on to triumph in their categories at the Oscars.In fact, 13 of the last 15 best actor winners at the Baftas have gone on to repeat their success at the Oscars, as well as 10 of the last 12 Bafta best actress winners.Who is performing and presenting?K-Pop fans are in for a treat, as Huntr/X singers Jae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami will perform their hit Golden, from animated movie KPop Demon Hunters.However, unlike the Oscars, there is no best original song category at the Baftas, so the chart-topping track isn't nominated.Jessie Ware will also take to the stage to perform during the ceremony's In Memoriam section, which pays tribute to the artists and creatives who have died during the past year.Aimee Lou Wood, Bryan Cranston, Cillian Murphy, Riz Ahmed, Delroy Lindo, Gillian Anderson, Glenn Close, Olivia Cooke, Patrick Dempsey, Sadie Sink, Stormzy, Alicia Vikander and Little Simz will also be among those presenting awards, alongside some of this year's nominees including Michael B Jordan and Kate Hudson.Meanwhile, this year's Bafta Fellowship honour will go to British-born Dame Donna Langley, chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment.Read more about some of this year's awards season films:Hamnet: Jessie Buckley 'overwhelmed' to be starring in Oscar-tipped HamnetMarty Supreme: Timothée Chalamet on table tennis, his twenties and his love of...

    "body": "Team GB face an uphill task to win an Olympic medal in the four-man bobsleigh as they sit seventh at the halfway point in a race where three teams crashed.Pilot Brad Hall had showcased why the British team are medal contenders in Cortina with a brilliant first run of 54.39 seconds, which placed them third.But he was left looking stunned and emotional after they dropped off the pace in the second, losing four places in the standings.They now sit 0.23secs off the bronze medal position before Sunday's podium-deciding heats.\"I'm a bit lost for words to be honest,\" Hall told BBC Sport.\"We had a really good first run and the second run just got away from us and I honestly don't really know where. It felt like a nice run to me but we bled some time.\"The three German teams remain the ones to beat and they occupy the top three spots with Johannes Lochner, who won two-man gold earlier this week, leading the charge with an overall time of 1:48:61. There was a long delay to competition at the Cortina sliding track after Austria suffered a crash during heat two, with one of the athletes treated for a lengthy period on the ice before being stretchered off.GB's Greg Crackett said Austrian pilot Jakob Mandlbauer had gone to hospital but was moving and \"seemed to be alright\".Action resumed after about a 20-minute delay but, with the track now slower because of the rising temperature, the British team were unable to find the speed of their first run and currently sit on 1:49:43.France and Trinidad and Tobago, piloted by Harrogate-born Axel Brown, also suffered crashes but both crews walked away from the sleds.Hall finished 12th in the two-man earlier this week, but said he is targeting a first medal in 12 years with his four-man team.Team Hall finished sixth four years ago in Beijing and the last Olympic cycle has been a fruitful one.Hall is the most successful British men's pilot in World Cup history with 30 race medals, and guided his team to a first world championship medal since 1939 when they took silver in Switzerland in 2023.That came after a first-ever European title in Altenberg earlier that year.Following that success, the sport received a boost in funding from UK Sport, having been cut in 2019 following poor results at Pyeongchang 2018.Training in Cortina has not been perfect, with the team clocking times outside the top five on five of the six runs.Things looked promising after run one and the team fist-pumped and banged the sled in celebration as they came up the finish straight.But mistakes in run two proved costly and their time of 55.04secs was only the 12th-quickest in run two, leaving medal hopes hanging by a thread.Team GB have not won an Olympic bobsleigh medal since Sochi 12 years ago, where the four-man team won bronze. Meanwhile, Team GB's Adele Nicoll and Ashleigh Nelson finished 15th in the two-woman event after producing two impressive runs to redeem themselves after a difficult opening two heats on Friday. Germany’s Laura Nolte and Deborah Levi won gold with compatriots Lisa Buckwitz and Neele Schuten claiming silver, while American veteran pilot Kaillie Armbruster Humphries took her second bronze of the Games having also come third in the monobob.",

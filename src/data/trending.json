    "body": "14 minutes agoFakana familyMarcus Fakana was killed three months after being freed from a Dubai jailThe driver of a car which crashed in London killing a teenager who had been freed from a Dubai jail for having a sexual relationship with a girl aged 17 has admitted killing him.Marwaan Mohamed Huseen, 20, was attempting to get away from pursuing Metropolitan Police officers when he crashed a BMW into a lorry, killing passenger Marcus Fakana.A second passenger in the vehicle was also badly hurt in the crash, which happened in the early hours of 3 October last year in Tottenham, north London.At Wood Green Crown Court on Friday, Huseen appeared by videolink from HMP Pentonville to plead guilty to causing the death of Fakana, 19, by dangerous driving.Huseen, who admitted being uninsured and unlicensed at the time, also pleaded guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving to another of the passengers in the BMW.The crash happened just three months after Fakana, from Tottenham, north London, was set free from a prison in Dubai.He had been with his parents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the summer 2024 when, at the age of 18, he had a holiday romance with a 17-year-old girl from London.The teenager spent around a year in prison before being freed thanks to a royal pardon from Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.At the time of the fatal car crash, the Met Police said officers were attempting to stop a \"vehicle of interest\" in Pretoria Road, Tottenham, and after a short pursuit they temporarily lost sight of the car driven by Huseen.When officers then drove in to The Roundway, they found the vehicle had been involved in a crash.Fakana was taken to hospital and later died from his injuries.The defendant was remanded back into custody and a sentencing date will be set at a further hearing on 27 February.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentGetty ImagesThe switch to CT scanners means clear transparent bags are no longer needed at the airportPassengers at Britain's biggest airport, Heathrow, can leave liquids in containers up to two litres in their bags while going through security, after it finally completed the rollout of new high-tech CT scanners.Electronics such as laptops can also be left in luggage, while clear plastic bags for liquids no longer have to be used.Heathrow now says it is the biggest airport in the world to have the new equipment fully rolled out across all its terminals.But while it has become the largest airport to roll out the new high-tech scanners, it is far from the UK's first, with Gatwick, Edinburgh and Birmingham airports having upgraded to them in recent years and increased to a two-litre limit.At most UK airports, passengers can keep liquid containers of up to 100ml in their luggage, without having to remove them and use clear plastic bags.Bristol and Belfast airports have also raised their liquid limits to two litres.However, other airports that have the new scanners installed are waiting for the green light from the Department for Transport (DfT) to raise the limit from 100ml.A recent report by consumer group Which? found that the sensitivity of the new scanners being rolled out means that at some airports, more bag searches end up being carried out by hand after passing through them. Heathrow said the scanners, which provide better images of cabin bags, could service \"thousands of passengers an hour with significantly greater efficiency, while maintaining high safety and security standards\".The rule change only applies to flights leaving Heathrow, and passengers must  check restrictions on luggage at the airports they are returning from before boarding flights to the UK. The rollout of the new high-tech scanners across the UK has suffered a series of setbacks over the past few years.Boris Johnson promised in 2019 that the rules about taking liquids through security in containers of no more than 100ml, inside plastics bags, would be scrapped by the end of 2022. The pandemic eventually put paid to that.In December 2022, the Conservative government promised state-of-the-art scanning equipment would be installed in security lanes by June 2024 in the \"biggest shake-up of airport security rules in decades\".Then-Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the dominance of \"tiny toiletry\" was nearly over.But, as it turned out, the June 2024 deadline was not achievable for the biggest airports - although a number of smaller ones, with fewer lanes to get sorted, did install the scanners in place before that date.Then, on the evening of Friday 13 June, 2024, the government said those smaller airports who had already introduced the new scanners and dropped their 100ml liquids rules, must reinstate them. This triggered anger among airport operators.The EU also announced a reversion to the 100ml rule in July that year. There has since been a period of inconsistency. Last summer, the Transport Secretary was telling passengers to assume the 100ml rule still applied.Heathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye said the £1bn package of upgrades would mean passengers could spend \"less time preparing for security and more time enjoying their journey\".Of the world's busiest 10 airports, Heathrow is the only one to have scrapped the 100ml rule for liquid containers on international flights.

    "body": "46 minutes agoPhil SimBBC Scotland political correspondentGetty ImagesThe documents in question relate to an ethics investigation into Nicola SturgeonScotland's Information Commissioner is taking legal action against the Scottish government after it missed a series of deadlines to produce documents about an ethics investigation into Nicola Sturgeon. Ministers had been given until Thursday to produce some correspondence relating to the inquiry, which saw the former first minister cleared of breaching the ministerial code over the investigation of her predecessor Alex Salmond. John Swinney told MSPs that it will \"not take much longer\" for these papers to be handed over. But David Hamilton has taken the unprecedented step of instructing solicitors to begin legal proceedings which could see the government held in contempt of court.The Scottish government has been approached for comment.The Commissioner's office is dealing with six different freedom of information appeals relating to the Sturgeon and Salmond inquiries, and Swinney has said almost 90 requests have been received in total. The government is appealing against two key cases in the Court of Session, including an order to produce some of the evidence considered by independent advisor James Hamilton during his ministerial code probe. Swinney told MSPs that some of this material could identify complainers in the criminal court case against Salmond - which saw him cleared of sexual assault in 2020 - and this would breach court orders around anonymity for complainers. Ministers have agreed to produce the papers involved in the current case - involving correspondence with the secretariat working for James Hamilton - but said it was taking time to make necessary redactions. But Information Commissioner David Hamilton said full and timely compliance with requests was a vital part of the freedom of information system, leading to the unprecedented decision to take legal action.Scottish Information CommissionerDavid Hamilton was appointed Scottish Information Commissioner in 2023Benjamin Harrop, a member of the public who made the original freedom of information requests, said it was \"really quite remarkable\" that the matter had resulted in legal action.He said on social media: \"Remember the SG (Scottish government) have had since 1st of December to release a new response to me. \"I am glad the SIC (Scottish Information Commissioner) has initiated these steps, demonstrating that authorities cannot simply disregard legal deadlines without consequences.\"How did we get here?Almost five years have passed since Nicola Sturgeon was cleared of breaching the ministerial code by independent advisor James Hamilton.Hamilton himself voiced frustration that his report had to be heavily redacted, stating that it \"presents an incomplete and even at times misleading version of what happened\".But the Irish barrister was bound by court orders preventing any publication which could lead to the \"jigsaw identification\" of the women who complained about Salmond's conduct.The Scottish government says those same rules are why it has lodged two different Court of Session appeals against releasing documents. John Swinney has been clear that publishing the evidence submitted to Hamilton's inquiry would identify complainers, and thus amount to a contempt of court.Ironically, his government is now at risk of being found in contempt over a request they have actually agreed to comply with.It is taking so long to redact the hundreds of documents involved in this request that two deadlines have been missed – leading to this unprecedented action by the Information Commissioner.It remains to be seen whether those documents are actually handed over before the court sits to consider this case, and whether that will make any difference to how it is judged.",

    "body": "Mandela's prison key, sunglasses and shirt can be sold after daughter wins court battleA South African court has dismissed an appeal by the country's heritage body to stop the sale and export of various artefacts connected to anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela.The 70 personal items include a cell key from Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 of the 27 years he was locked up, a pair of Aviator sunglasses and one of his signature floral shirts. They were due to be exported to the US for auction.The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. In trying to stop their sale, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former resident's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argues that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.",

    "body": "21 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterBBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's 'Board of Peace'Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.Cooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.Cooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.Some of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.The UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.But launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.Trump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"Trump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\". \"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.President Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.President Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.But the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.Putin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.But she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"She said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.Yvette Cooper speaking to BBC Breakfast from Davos, in SwitzerlandDiplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.But Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.Cooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.But when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.The UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.Trump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.But the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.The text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".The leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.The charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.Last Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.More have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.The Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.",

    "body": "Retired civil servants left in pension limbo 13 hours agoMartin GrahamBBC NewsAlamySome former state employees across the country have been left with no income this month after the company managing civil service pensions failed to pay them.The Civil Service Pension Scheme, which manages the pensions of 1.7 million public sector workers in the UK, has been unable to provide lump sums or regular payments to many people since Capita took over the administration of the scheme in December.Capita said it had been left with a much bigger backlog of cases than originally agreed and apologised to those affected.One retiree, Steve Duell, told the BBC he would have to borrow to pay his bills if he does not receive his pension by the end of the month.Steve DuellSteve Duell had made plans to get work done on his house, on the basis that he received his lump sum payment in January, which he has notThe 65-year-old from Hull retired on 1 January after 40 years at the Land Registry. He should have received a lump sum shortly afterwards but has received no information at all about his retirement package.Steve said he made numerous attempts to contact the administrators, including spending nearly 15 hours on the phone on hold.\"We've got no money, and we've got lots of financial commitments.\"We need to pay off car loans and make mortgage payments. \"We arranged to get building work done on the house, on the basis of expecting a lump sum at the start of January,\" he said.The outsourcing services firm, Capita, took over the contract in December after a lead-in time of two years. It administers pensions for public sector institutions including HMRC, the MoD, the Welsh government, the Scottish government, Transport Scotland, the Crown Prosecution Service, Defra and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. Paul McKenna, from Liverpool, spent most of his working life working with the Inland Revenue and HMRC.Now aged 59, he planned to retire early on health grounds, after having a heart bypass operation. He gave the required five months' notice to start his pension, before finishing work on 30 November.He had hoped to use his lump sum to pay off his mortgage, then live off his pension payments, but is still waiting.\"The worry has been affecting my sleep, it's bad for my angina. \"I'm supposed to be getting married in September, but this has left me with lots of uncertainty,\" he said.When he telephoned he waited for an hour on hold before being given the message:  \"The building is on fire and we've had to evacuate.\"He said that happened twice, before getting through, only to be told his case was with the \"resolutions team\".Inherited backlogCapita has previously faced criticism over their management of teachers' pensions in England and Wales, and has lost that contract to rival Tata.Until the end of November 2025, the Civil Service Pension Scheme was administered by a company called MyCSP. The contract was taken over by Capita on 1 December, in a seven-year deal worth £239m.Capita launched a new online portal, for customers to access projections of their expected pensions and lump sum payments. But the portal launch was plagued with problems.In a statement to the BBC, Capita said that when it took over it had expected a backlog of 37,000 cases, but the actual number of outstanding cases was 86,000.  Capita says it now has more than 500 people working on the project, double that of the previous provider.\"Our teams are working tirelessly to clear the backlog we inherited and resolve member queries as quickly as possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to our members,\" the firm said.Parliament's Public Accounts Committee warned in October that Capita would not be ready for the planned takeover.Committee chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said at the time: \"It is deeply frustrating for this committee to be scrutinising an issue that ought to be as seamlessly run as civil service pensions. \"Scheme members who have dedicated their careers to public service ought to be secure in the knowledge that it is under sound administration.\"Responsibility for managing the administrator contract rests with the Cabinet Office. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said it remained \"committed to working with Capita to ensure the scheme's success and [to] safeguard the interests of all members.\"We are aware of the issues some members have faced and we have instructed Capita to fix them urgently,\" the spokesperson added.\"We have been assured that Capita is rolling out targeted fixes to better meet the demands of members and employers.\"Fran Heathcote, general secretary of the PCS union, which represents civil servants, said: \"This fiasco is extremely distressing for those who have worked and paid into their pension all their working lives.\"We believe that this work should be run by the civil service, under ministerial control, so that it can be properly resourced and pensions paid on time.\"",

Nearby, Pulp are queueing for a fresh batch of lasagne. Around them, half a dozen of children are running around, filming everything on handheld cameras. All of them are excitedly awaiting the arrival of Olivia Rodrigo.These were the scenes in London last November, as some of the world's biggest stars convened to record a new charity album in aid of Warchild.The tracklist, revealed yesterday, is like a who's who of indie rock. Wet Leg, The Last Dinner Party, Wolf Alice, Fontaines DC, Nilüfer Yanya, Cameron Winter, Ezra Collective, Foals and Young Fathers all contribute.Over the course of one week, 23 tracks were recorded. At times, five of Abbey Road's famed studios were in use, with collaborations springing up on the spur of the moment.Blur's Graham Coxon plays guitar with Rodrigo on a cover of The Magnetic Fields' The Book Of Love. Damon Albarn's session saw him joined by Johnny Marr on guitar, with additional vocals by Kae Tempest and Grian Chatten.Later in the day, Jarvis Cocker got back from a bathroom break to find them all in his studio - so he got them to sing the intro to a new Pulp song, Begging For Change.\"The just turned up, so I thought, 'Why not?'\" he laughs. \"I'm not used to that kind of thing, but it was really good.\"War ChildThe original 1995 Help album featured Noel Gallagher, Paul McCartney and Paul Weller playing a cover of The Beatles' Come Together, under the name Mojo FiltersThe album is the spritual successor to 1995's Help! - recorded at the height of Britpop, and featuring contributions from Paul Weller, Radiohead, Suede, Paul McCartney, The KLF, Portishead and The Manic Street Preachers.It was also, famously, the only time Oasis and Blur appeared on the same record, just months after their legendary (and acrimonious) chart battle.\"We'll put aside our differences for the cause,\" Noel Gallagher said at the time. \"And it's the only time you'll see us agreeing on anything.\"The record sold 70,000 copies in its first week, raising nearly £1.25m to help children in war-stricken areas, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2025, the fund-raising is even more urgent. According to Warchild, 520 million children worldwide - almost one in five - are affected by war, with simultaneous crises in Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza. The figure is higher than any time since the Second World War, at the same time as governments across the world are cutting international aid.\"At the moment, there really does seem to be a lot of bad things happening, and a lot of people feel powerless,\" says Cocker. \"They're looking at the news and they don't know what to do. So I would hope this album is something the people can enjoy, and also know that they're trying to make a positive change.\"ReutersMore than 15 million children are in need of assistance in Sudan alone, with more than a third of the population fleeing their homes amidst a brutal civil warThe first single, released on Thursday, is a new track by Arctic Monkeys called Opening Night.A sparse, sinister ballad, it finds Alex Turner singing about political sloganeering and \"supercomputer crusades\" before a beautifully harmonised chorus that offers a message of hope in dark times.The song dates back a couple of years, drummer Matt Helders tells the BBC, but had never been finished. Getting the call from Warchild was the prompt they needed to complete the song, with lyrics that felt like a call to arms.\"With charity records, it's often tempting to do a cover, or an interesting collaboration,\" he says, \"but we enjoy making records and being in the studio, so it was fun to work on something that we'd written.\"Adding to the fun was that film crew of children, principally aged between eight and 10, who documented the entire recording progress.They were corralled by Bafta-winning director Jonathan Glazer (Sexy Beast, Under The Skin, The Zone Of Interest), who wanted to connect the music back to the young people it would help.\"They were given free reign to just roam around, which really changed the atmosphere,\" says Helders. \"Studios can be quite a stiff, clinical environment, sometimes. But they were walking around and bumping into stuff. It made it fun.\"War ChildThe stars at Abbey Road were filmed and interviewed by a cast of junior documentariansCocker wasn't so sure.\"I hate anybody watching me sing in the studio, because I'm kind of a self-conscious person and somebody pointing a camera at me doesn't help with that,\" he says.\"And while I was singing in there, I think they were getting a bit bored, so they were just like lying on the floor and filming the ceiling.\"Ultimately, he found the children's presence liberating. Something about their total lack of interest allowed him to shed the idea that the studio recording has to capture \"the perfect, definitive version\" of a song.As a result, Pulp's contribution to Help(2) is called Begging For Change - and it has a loose, live band feeling that exemplifies the album's spontaneity and sense of community.In fact, the youthful camera crew even made it onto the record.\"It's an interesting thing, you know, because kids are always told, 'Shut up, because I'm trying to think', or, 'Shhh, your dad's hungover',\" he says.\"So when they're given the chance to make a noise, they will do that. So what we tried to do on our song was to get them to scream, and they did it very well.\"Jarvis Cocker said he hoped the album would raise both money and awarenessYou won't get to hear that song until Help(2) is released on 6 March. Thanks to record labels and pressing plants donating their services free of charge, it will be cheaper than standard albums - with a double vinyl costing around £26 - and Warchild receiving all the profits.\"We found that this project really lit a fire under the creative community, \" says Rich Clarke, the charity's head of music. \"Lots of people wanted to get involved.\"He lets slip that the 23 tracks on the album weren't the only product of the week-long recording sessions.\"There's a there's a whole load of tracks, around 10 or so, that that came in when people heard about the project. So actually, there were some tough decisions for the team about what made it onto the record.\"But Olivia Rodrigo's song - about the purity of love - was always earmarked as the closing track.\"It's a really beautiful cover,\" says Clarke. \"The record really takes you through a journey, with some powerful themes around conflict, but Olivia leaves you with a track about the redemptive power of love, which is a really poignant final note\".",

    "body": "United States forward Trinity Rodman has become the world's highest-paid female footballer after signing a three-year deal with Washington Spirit, according to her agent.The 23-year-old, daughter of former NBA star Dennis Rodman, has been a free agent since her previous deal with the Spirit expired on 31 December.But her new deal, worth a reported $2m (£1.5m) a year including bonuses, will keep Rodman with Spirit until 2028. Her agent, Mike Senkowski, told ESPN the deal will make Rodman the highest-paid female footballer in the world.\"It feels amazing. I'm very happy. I'm very blessed,\" Rodman said.\"I think it's a monumental and game-changing moment right now. I can't even describe in words what it feels like.\"Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati, winner of the Ballon d'Or in 2023, 2024 and 2025, was reportedly the highest-earning female player before Rodman's deal. In 2025 the salary cap for the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) was $3.5m (£2.6m) per team. But the NWSL board of governors approved a new 'High Impact Player' rule in December, which allowed teams to spend up to $1m (£760,000) over the cap on players that meet certain criteria. \"Trinity is a generational player, but more importantly she represents the future of this club and the future of women's soccer,\" said Washington Spirit owner Michele Kang.Rodman helped Spirit win the NWSL Championship in her debut season in 2021 and was named the NWSL Rookie of the Year.She has won 47 caps for the USA, scoring 11 goals since her debut in 2022. She scored three goals at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where the USA won gold. Dennis Rodman won five NBA Championships with the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls.The future of Rodman was of great interest to Europe's most successful clubs with the potential to pick up a world-class player in the free market.Serial Women's Super League winners Chelsea were one of the clubs monitoring her situation and were willing to pounce if the solution for Rodman from the NWSL had fallen through.It has been an unprecedented situation in the US with the league and Washington Spirit battling through legalities to try to keep one of their best talents.At the age of 23, Rodman is not the best player in the world, but she has the potential to become that and would undoubtedly be a significant loss to the NWSL had they not managed to keep her.They have seen USA stars Naomi Girma and Alyssa Thompson leave for Chelsea, and in January midfielder Sam Coffey made a high-profile move to Manchester City.The NWSL had led the way for many years in women's football but the WSL and Mexico's Liga MX Femenil are among those now spending big money on player transfer fees and wages.Barcelona boast the two players who have scooped the past five Ballon d'Or awards - Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas - but the club has financial strains.US billionaire and multi-club owner Kang is investing heavily in her clubs - Lyon, Washington and London City Lionesses - meaning salaries are only going to increase across the global women's football landscape.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSuranjana Tewari,Asia business correspondentandLily Jamali,North America technology correspondentWatch: Does TikTok's US deal threaten the company's global ambitions?TikTok has closed a deal that will allow the hugely popular short-video app to continue operating in the US, it announced on Thursday.The deal comes after a years-long tussle between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first term in the White House when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.The platform was due to be banned in the US in January 2025 if its Chinese owner, ByteDance, failed to sell its US operations to American investors. But US President Donald Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation to take down the app.The main source of contention was the app's powerful algorithm, which dictates the content recommended to users. Now that formula has been licensed to the app's American owners and will be trained only on US data.Experts say this will certainly produce changes, but how exactly it affects the 200 million Americans on the app remains unclear.What is the deal about?For years Washington has been pressuring TikTok to sell its US operations, citing national security concerns over its Chinese owner ByteDance. Lawmakers had expressed fears that Beijing could force the firm to hand over US users' data. Both TikTok and ByteDance have consistently denied the claim.The idea of a TikTok ban, first floated by Trump during his first term in 2020, gained momentum under Joe Biden's presidency. In 2024, Biden signed a law demanding that ByteDance sell TikTok or face a ban in the US.A legal battle ensued between ByteDance and the US government, and in January last year the app went offline for US users for 12 to 14 hours. That temporary blackout was restored after Trump, then the president-elect, pledged to reverse the ban.Last September, Trump announced that he had reached a deal with China to keep the app running in the US. And in December, binding agreements were signed with American and global investors to operate TikTok's business in the US, according to a memo from its chief executive Shou Zi Chew.More details of this deal were outlined in TikTok's latest announcement.Under the agreement, a new business called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures.Trump has weighed in on the deal, writing on social media that he was \"so happy to have helped in saving TikTok\". The BBC has contacted the White House and the China's embassy in Washington for comment.Who owns TikTok in the US now?TikTok says the new joint venture will operate as an independent entity governed by a seven-member, majority-American board of directors.Adam Presser, formerly of WarnerMedia, was appointed as the chief executive of the joint venture.There are three managing investors for TikTok's US operations, each holding a 15% stake:Oracle - the cloud computing giant chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime Trump allySilver Lake - a US tech investment firm that says it holds approximately $116bn in assets (£85.9bn)MGX - an Emirati investor in AI and technologyReutersTikTok's global boss Shou Zi Chew will be on the board of the new firmOracle will be responsible for securing the data of TikTok's American users and oversee the retraining of the app's powerful content recommendation algorithm.ByteDance will retain a 19.9% stake in the business.The remaining 35.1% of the company is owned by a group of companies including the family office of tech executive Michael Dell - another Trump supporter - and Vastmere Strategic Investments, an affiliate of Susquehanna International Group. Susquehanna was co-founded by Trump ally Jeff Yass, whose personal share in TikTok's owner ByteDance was roughly 7% as of last year. Its managing director, Mark Dooley, will also be a member of the new firm's board of directors.The board will also include TikTok's global boss Shou Zi Chew as well as executives from Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX.What about TikTok's 'secret sauce' algorithm?This question is at the heart of the tussle over TikTok's US operations. Its algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" that has driven the app's huge popularity.A former social media executive previously told the BBC that other companies have tried to re-create the algorithm, from Instagram's Reels to YouTube's Shorts, but they're just not as good. \"Generally, the one who introduces the technology just knows how to do it better.\"ByteDance had initially refused to part with its prized formula - a stance backed by the Chinese government. But last September, Beijing's top cybersecurity regulator signalled that Beijing could allow ByteDance to license the algorithm to a US company owner.According to the deal, the algorithm will be retrained on US user data only, which will be protected to meet American regulations. The algorithm will be \"secured in Oracle's US cloud environment\", TikTok said.The impact of this shift will soon be felt by the millions of American TikTok users.Experts say this might mean a slower, lighter app that operates differently from the global version. The algorithm might also not recommend content as successfully as the current platform.Additional reporting by Koh Ewe",

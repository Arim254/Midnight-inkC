    "body": "Annual Channel migrant crossings highest since 20221 hour agoBob DaleSouth EastPA MediaSeveral migrants were brought ashore in Dover on 20 DecemberA total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.Home Office figures showed a 13% rise on the 36,566 total in 2024.It was the highest number since 2022, when nearly 46,000 migrants crossed.The government says it has already removed 50,000 people who were in the UK illegally and is working more closely with the French government.There were 28 days without any crossings from 15 November to 12 December, which some observers attributed to strong winds in the Channel.Figures from the Home Office then showed 737 people arrived on 13 December, and more than 600 more in the following four days.A total of 803 people arrived in 13 boats on 21 December, a record for a single day in December.The last arrivals of 2025 were on 22 December, when 17 people were brought ashore at Dover.PA MediaHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced a major shake up of the asylum system in November.In November the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced major reforms for the asylum process, describing the current system as \"out of control and unfair\".The changes include overseas visas requiring higher qualifications, immigrants will have to wait longer to be allowed residency, overseas students only being allowed to stay for 18 months after graduating and some migrants facing a 20-year wait before being allowed to settle permanently.A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better.\"This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Enzo Maresca's Chelsea won only once in the Premier League in DecemberByFootball reporterUpdated 3 minutes agoLess than six months after guiding Chelsea to Club World Cup success, Enzo Maresca has left his post as head coach.The Blues won just one of their final seven Premier League matches under Maresca and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.After their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.Two days on, Maresca has gone. But how did things unravel?From stability to troubleMedia caption, From Match of the Day on 13 December: What did Maresca mean?At the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.On 12 December, Maresca was named Premier League manager of the month for November.Just one league win followed in December but it was not just results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.Maresca stunned key figures at Stamford Bridge - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.Those comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.They have since been explained as being linked to medical recommendations. Maresca felt the club were telling him who to pick, and that crossed a red line. But the staff were trying to limit injured players' minutes through standard protocols, which senior figures inside the club said were ignored and either risked players getting injured again - or prevented them from training because of overload.Even after that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.Those with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement over which players should start and which substitutions should be made during matches.He also felt a lack of protection from the club over the quality of his work. And on Thursday came news that was not unexpected, with Chelsea confirming the two parties had gone their separate ways. The Blues' players will return to work on Friday closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League as they prepare for a defining period.They face Manchester City on Sunday to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.Chelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.What happened to Maresca behind the scenes?Chelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.While victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.Maresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.In line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.Their transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - remains in place.Maresca knew what he was signing up for - and his issues were not with the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group.This season, he and his agent had informed the club of interest from Juventus and Manchester City, while also making it clear he had no intention of leaving and was open to a possible contract renewal.But difficulties remained in his working relationship with the Chelsea ownership.The Italian was encouraged to rotate his squad, but often felt that when he did so in the Premier League, they dropped points. He openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy but there was frustration each time Maresca sought to make his complaints public rather than discussing internally first.He later admitted his comments after the Everton were premeditated - rejecting the club's claim they were an emotional outburst after a tense match. Maresca also wanted to take on some external engagements following the club's recent successes. He had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club. A claim a source close to Maresca denies. He also spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.He also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.Those close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, made it known he was weighing up his future.The last week seemed to be the turning point in Maresca's mind, with Chelsea more keen to make any change of manager in the summer. The home supporters, who Maresca holds in high regard, booed his decisions to take off Cole Palmer in a defeat by Aston Villa and the draw with Bournemouth. Maresca was reportedly told by the medical department he needed to make that change, despite insisting in his news conference his star attacker could complete 90 minutes if he wanted to.All of this after a positive start...After Maresca's side beat Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup in December, supporters chanted his name.They hadn't done so as openly since appearing to be mounting an unlikely title challenge last season, when fans also sang 'We've got our Chelsea back'.But a disappointing run followed, and supporters turned on Maresca both inside the stadium and on social media.Part of the criticism was Maresca seemed a distant, project-focused manager, as fans struggled to move on from the very different and successful era under Roman Abramovich's stewardship.Though he won the Club World Cup, many supporters disliked his communication style and slow, patient football - and influential fans said chants in support of Maresca were largely a protest against the club's BlueCo ownership.That is why Chelsea continued efforts to convince supporters Maresca was the right manager and that the ownership's ultra long-term approach would eventually bring sustained success.Key figures at the club admired Maresca's style of play, insisting it improved players, and that any successor would adopt a similar approach. Further progress was made with team spirit after Mauricio Pochettino had laid the foundations.Regular starters broadly liked Maresca, but - perhaps inevitably - he was less popular on the fringes if the squad. There were complaints after one-off tactical missteps. One player questioned their man-to-man marking approach in a heavy defeat at Manchester City in January 2025, and Maresca said he needed to coach better after a home loss to Brighton, when Chelsea had a player sent off.The club's only real concern in his first season was his sometimes clumsy news conferences, attributed -  as an Italian who speaks Spanish at home - to English being his third language.In their view, he had played down Chelsea's chances of Champions League qualification too much, - alienating ambitious fans. There was also a curious moment at the Club World Cup when he awkwardly refused to praise Mexican set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva to a compatriot in the media, despite previously praising coaches closer to him.Maresca also adopted a cold, aggressive tone towards Chelsea's so-called 'bomb squad'. Initially, it proved useful - leaving unwanted players in no doubt they had to leave. But when players such as Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi failed to secure transfers, the approach became counterproductive, as the Blues have a legal obligation to look after the interests of all players on their books.Sources close to Maresca say he felt he deserved backing similar to that enjoyed by Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool and even Ruben Amorim during his struggles at Manchester United - including a say in shaping the project. Arteta, for example, has significant influence over Arsenal's transfer policy.But at Chelsea, the project is king - and the club are more comfortable seeing another manager slot in, rather than ceding any control.Can Chelsea move forward?Chelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.They begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford and West Ham before the end of the month.In addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.Chelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.The fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.",

So who am I? Who is Jamie?\"Turning 40 and getting my ADHD diagnosis and going through a divorce really reinforced the need and desire to have my own identity again.\"At my birth, believe it or not was Jamie Bigg. So in 2026, I'll be reclaiming my birth name and making some big changes.\"I want to move forward with the greatest amount of transparency in all walks of my life.\"So whether that's speaking on my ADHD diagnosis and journey or helping with your fitness goals, being the best father possible or just being a better human overall, I'll be entering 2026 as me, Jamie Bigg.\"More on this story",

    "body": "Watch: Huge fire rips through historic Amsterdam church during New Year celebrationsPolice in the Netherlands were pelted with fireworks and faced an \"unprecedented amount of violence\" on New Year's Eve, officers have said.A 19th century church in Amsterdam was engulfed by fire in the early hours of New Year's Day, although the cause of the blaze is not yet known.The Vondelkerk, which overlooks the largest park in the city, the Vondelpark, has been a tourist attraction since it was built in 1872.Elsewhere in the Netherlands, a 17-year-old boy and 38-year-old man were killed in fireworks incidents. In Bielefeld, Germany, local police said two 18-year-olds died after setting off homemade fireworks.The head of the Dutch Police Union, Nine Kooiman, said she had been pelted by fireworks and other explosives on her shift in Amsterdam.The amount of violence was \"unprecedented\" she said.Reports of attacks against police and firefighters were widespread across the country. Petrol bombs were thrown at police in the southern city of Breda. In Rotterdam, the city's eye hospital said it had treated 14 patients, including 10 minors, for eye injuries. Two received surgery.A 17-year-old boy from Nijmegen and a 38-year-old man from Aalsmeer were killed in fireworks incidents, local media reported.In Amsterdam the 50-metre high tower of the historic Vondelkerk church collapsed. Authorities said the roof was badly damaged but the structure was expected to remain intact.The neo-Gothic basilica was designed by architect Pierre Cuypers whose works also include the Rijksmuseum.

    "body": "27 minutes agoBen TobiasWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireSeveral dozen people are thought to have died and more than 100 injured following a fire in a ski resort in south-west Switzerland, officials have said.Police said several nationalities were likely involved in the New Year's Day fire, which happened at 01:30 local time (00:30 GMT) in a bar called Le Constellation in the resort of Crans-Montana. It is being treated as a fire and there is \"no question\" of an attack, the region's chief prosecutor said.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fireA helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117Here's what we know so far. What do we know about the victims? At a news conference on Thursday morning police said \"several dozen\" people were presumed to have died in the fire, although it was too early to give a precise number. The Italian foreign ministry - citing Swiss police - said it believed around 40 people had died.More than 100 people were injured, mostly with severe burns, Swiss officials said. They have been transported to hospitals across Switzerland. A burns unit in Milan in neighbouring Italy has also been made available. The director of Lausanne University Hospital told a Swiss newspaper that 22 patients had been transferred to her centre's care so far, mostly aged 16-26. Work is ongoing to identify the victims and return bodies to families as quickly as possible, the region's chief-prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said.But the Italian ambassador to Switzerland warned it could take weeks to identify the dead. Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  French media has reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered \"the full solidarity of France and our fraternal support\" to Switzerland. The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.What caused the fire? The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. \"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to startWhat do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. Police Cantonale ValaisannePolice have released images from inside the bar after the fire showing chairs and benches strewn across the room",

    "body": "Government to defend decision to strip Begum's UK citizenship7 hours agoSuzanne LeighSam Tarling/Getty ImagesThe home secretary will \"robustly defend\" the decision to strip Shamima Begum of her British citizenship, as European judges scrutinise the move, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but a government source said the the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.Now 26, she was subsequently stripped of her British citizenship on the grounds that she posed a threat to national security but her lawyers say this failed to consider whether she was a victim of grooming and trafficking.The ECHR has asked the Home Office whether ministers at the time considered whether Ms Begum had been a victim, and whether the UK had obligations to her.But a government source said: \"The home secretary will robustly defend the decision to revoke Shamima Begum's citizenship, which has been tested and upheld time and again in our domestic courts.\"The home secretary will always put this country's national security first.\"In a document published by the ECHR earlier this month, it states that Ms Begum is challenging the decision to revoke her British citizenship under Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights - prohibition of slavery and forced labour.The case was lodged in December 2024 after the UK's Supreme Court denied her the chance to challenge the decision.The four questions posed by judges in Strasbourg to the Home Office, include: \"Did the Secretary of State  have a positive obligation, by virtue of Article 4 of the Convention, to consider whether the applicant had been a victim of trafficking, and whether any duties or obligations to her flowed from that fact, before deciding to deprive her of her citizenship?\"Ms Begum was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and was 15 when she left Bethnal Green, east London, with two schoolfriends in 2015 to support the Islamic State group.She had married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived.She was later found in a refugee camp in Syria and a tribunal ruled in February 2020 that because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\" removing her British nationality would not make her stateless.A series of appeals were made, ending in the decision that she would not be allowed to challenge it at the Supreme Court.Lawyer Gareth Pierce, who is representing Ms Begum, said it was \"impossible to dispute\" that a 15-year-old was \"lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to Isil-controlled territory\".She added: \"It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.\"It has already been long conceded that the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, who took the precipitous decision in 2019 very publicly to deprive Ms Begum of citizenship, had failed entirely to consider the issues of grooming and trafficking of a school child in London and of the state's consequent duties.\"The Conservatives said Ms Begum should not be allowed to return to the UK \"under any circumstances\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said Ms Begum \"chose to go and support the violent Islamist extremists\".He added: \"She has no place in the UK and our own Supreme Court found that depriving her of citizenship was lawful.\"It is deeply concerning the European Court of Human Rights is now looking at using the ECHR to make the UK take her back.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterGetty ImagesPeople buying cryptocurrency in the UK now need to share their account details or face penalties, in changes that came into effect on 1 January. The move by the UK's tax body is designed to ensure they pay all relevant tax on buying and selling crypto, including capital gains tax.HMRC will begin automatically collecting information on all users of cryptocurrency exchanges - which are effectively the industry's banks - in a bid to start collecting tens of millions in unpaid tax.The change comes as the financial watchdog continues its consultation on tougher regulation for the industry, including measures to stop insider trading.The value of Bitcoin, which is often seen as a barometer of the entire industry, surged from about $93,500 (£69,500) a coin at the start of 2025 to a high of nearly $124,500 before falling below $90,000 by the end of the year.Investors who bought when the value was lower and sold when it was higher are in line to pay taxes, but authorities have historically struggled to collect it, says Dawn Register, a tax dispute resolution partner at accountancy firm BDO. \"HMRC has been concerned for some time about high levels of non-compliance among crypto investors,\" she says.The new rules coming in will make it much harder for the crypto rich to hide any untaxed gains, giving the tax authorities much more information about crypto users and their transactions.Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act like banks for the industry allowing people to exchange standard currency for virtual coins, must now ensure they automatically share up to date and accurate accounts of all their users' earnings. If not, fines may be imposed. These Cryptoasset Reporting Framework (CARF) regulations are being implemented in dozens of other countries  which will make international cooperation easier for tax authorities to share information.In the UK, the HMRC estimates there could be many thousands of crypto owners with unpaid tax bills and hope the new rules will bring in at least £300m in the next five years.Ms Register warns that anyone who made crypto gains in the 2024-25 financial year may have to file a tax return before 31 January, through a new dedicated section in the self-assessment form.\"HMRC is also looking to encourage voluntary disclosure where people have unpaid tax in earlier years and want to correct their affairs,\" she says.\"HMRC is running a disclosure facility where taxpayers can come clean on undeclared gains and unpaid tax prior to April 2024.\"Meanwhile, the Financial Conduct Authority is running public consultation until 12 February on other proposed crypto rules, which include standards for crypto exchanges, new requirements to ensure brokers act responsibly, and rules around crypto lending and borrowing.Commenting on the consultation last month, the authority's executive director for payments and digital finance David Geale said regulation was coming.\"Our goal is to have a regime that protects consumers, supports innovation and promotes trust. We welcome feedback to help us finalise these rules,\" he said.With additional reporting from Joe Tidy",

    "body": "6 hours agoVanessa BuschschlüterUS Southern CommandA screengrab from a video posted by US Southern Command shows a small vessel in the sea with what appears to be debris floating nearby.The US military says it struck two boats it alleges were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board.US Southern Command did not say where it had carried out the latest strikes but US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics to the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific for the past three months. Wednesday's strike came a day after the US targeted what it said were \"three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy\", killing at least three people.The Trump administration has cast its operations as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September. That first attack has come under particular scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington since it emerged that US forces struck the targeted boat twice.Two people who had survived the first strike and were clinging to the hull of their boat were killed in the second. Some lawmakers expressed concern that the \"double-tap\" strike breached the rules of engagement. In its post announcing the strike on a convoy of three boats carried out on 30 December, US Southern Command said that there had been a number of survivors, without specifying how many.It said that \"the remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels\". It added that the US Coast Guard had been \"immediately notified\" to search for the survivors.Reuters news agency reports that it was told by a US official who asked to remain anonymous that eight survivors were being searched for.It is not yet clear if any of them have been found. The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs but in its most recent post, Southern Command again insisted that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

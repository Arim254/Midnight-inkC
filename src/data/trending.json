    "body": "VAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this seasonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool and Bournemouth were drawing 0-0 when Marcos Senesi should have been sent off through a VAR reviewByFootball issues correspondentVideo assistant referee errors have risen in the first half of the Premier League season.Data collected by BBC Sport taken from the Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) Panel shows mistakes have increased 30% season-on-season from 10 to 13.It is still a marked improvement on previous years, with 20 errors at this stage of the 2023-24 campaign and 23 in 2022-23.All but two of the mistakes are missed interventions, up from seven to 11, when the video assistant refereee (VAR) failed to advise the referee he should change a decision.Incorrect interventions are down from three to two. But total overturns have also dropped from 57 in 2024-25 to 47 this season - a fall of 17.54%.The KMI Panel also catalogues on-field mistakes which did not reach the clear and obvious threshold for VAR to intervene. There are also up from 12 to 15.Here is every mistake this season across these categories.How the KMI Panel worksThe KMI Panel meets every week to dissect each decision, from goals to penalties to red cards.  It has five members: three former players and coaches, plus one representative each from the Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO).The KMI Panel was created by the Premier League clubs in 2022 to take performance stats out of the hands of the refereeing body.Crucially, it is not intended to look at each incident like any fan or manager would. It takes into account the laws of the game and, crucially, how the Premier League expects its games to be refereed. That is why the list of errors will not be as extensive as supporters would expect.The KMI Panel first looks at the decision of the on-field referee team, and then of the VAR.As the VAR is operating to a higher threshold - clear and obvious - there are times when the KMI Panel will say the referee was wrong but the VAR was correct not to intervene. The KMI Panel also considers second yellow cards which were missed, or incorrectly shown.1. Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth: Senesi red cardThe ball accidentally hit Marcos Senesi's arm but he then deliberately batted it away just as Hugo Ekitike was about to run through on goal. The referee did not show Senesi a card having deemed it to not be foul play.The VAR, Michael Oliver, only looked at the first touch on the arm.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is a secondary action by Senesi, where he moves his arm to flick the ball away, which is a handball offence. The majority feel that this was an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.\"2. Chelsea 2-0 Fulham: King's goal is disallowedThe game was goalless in the 21st minute when Josh King scored to give Fulham the lead. Referee Rob Jones initially gave the goal. It was wrongly ruled out through a VAR review for a foul in the build-up by Rodrigo Muniz on Trevoh Chalobah.This was a high-profile error which led to the VAR, Michael Salisbury, being stood down from his next appointment. On-field vote: 5-0VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Muniz has possession and Chalobah tries to step in to win the ball. This contact is normal in the context of the skill Muniz was performing.\"3. Wolves 2-3 Everton: Bueno denied a penaltyHugo Bueno tried to jink back inside in the 70th minute, but went down under a challenge from Iliman Ndiaye.Referee Michael Oliver allowed play to continue and the VAR, Craig Pawson, decided there was not enough in it for a review.Wolves trailed 3-1 at the time and could have got back into the game. On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Bueno turns back into Ndiaye who does not make any contact on the ball. The contact made is careless and the panel felt that a penalty should have been awarded.\"4. Brentford 3-1 Man Utd: Collins escapes red cardImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nathan Collins escaped with only a yellow card after dragging back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to shootNathan Collins pulled back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to latch on to a pass. Referee Craig Pawson gave the penalty but only cautioned Collins. The VAR, Andy Madley, did not think Mbeumo was in control to be denied a scoring chance. Brentford, 2-1 up in the 71st minute, should have been reduced to 10 men. And Bruno Fernandes' penalty was saved.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"There is an impactful holding action by Collins which is not an attempt to play the ball. Mbuemo is clearly prevented from having a clear shot at goal.\"5. Chelsea 1-3 Brighton: Gusto's high bootMalo Gusto raised a foot to make a clearance, not realising Yankuba Minteh was behind him. The Brighton player went down holding his head, but referee Simon Hooper did not believe there was contact. The VAR, Darren England, felt there was no conclusive proof for an overturn.The game was 1-1 in the 87th minute but Brighton scored twice in stoppage time.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Gusto's foot is raised and makes clear contact with the shoulder and head of Minteh and the VAR should have intervened.\"6. Crystal Palace 3-3 Bournemouth: Senesi avoids red againImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marcos Senesi would have been suspended for a total of three games had he been shown the two red cardsReferee Jarred Gillett was sent to the pitchside monitor by the VAR, Alex Chilowicz.Gillett rejected the advice that Senesi should be sent off for a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO) foul on Ismaila Sarr. He stuck by his yellow card because he felt the ball was moving away from goal. Bournemouth were 2-0 up in the 51st minute when the incident happened. This goes down as a correct VAR intervention, but incorrect final outcome. On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 3-2What the panel said: \"The majority felt that Sarr was very likely to gain possession with the ability to create an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"7. Brentford 3-1 Newcastle: Burn trips OuattaraImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dango Ouattara was booked for simulation but the Premier League's KMI Panel says he should have been awarded a penalty kickDan Burn stood on the foot of Dango Ouattara with the Brentford player theatrically throwing himself to the ground.It was the reaction which caused the VAR, Paul Tierney, to stay out of it. Brentford did get a penalty shortly afterwards for a clash between the same two players. On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel were unanimous in their view that Burn commits a careless tripping offence. The panel were however split regarding the VAR outcome. Two members felt that the referee's call should stand as the contact was glancing.\"8. Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham: Kilman's swipe at the ballImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Kilman should have been sent off for handball through a VAR review as well as conceding a spot-kickBournemouth trailed West Ham 2-0 when they were given a penalty in the 66th minute. Max Kilman had handled the ball when he was on the ground.Referee Thomas Bramall only showed a yellow card, and VAR Michael Oliver supported that.But there had been a deliberate movement of the arm by Kilman to prevent Evanilson getting a shot off.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is clear evidence that Kilman makes an additional movement with his arm to swipe the ball and in doing so this denies an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"9. Newcastle 2-1 Man City: Foden caught lateImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The game was goalless when Fabian Schar fouled Phil Foden inside the box, and Newcastle went on to win the game 2-1The game was goalless after 17 minutes when Phil Foden released a shot. He was caught late by Fabian Schar.Defenders are given a fair bit of latitude to try to block a shot, and a natural collision will not be ruled as a penalty. On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Despite Foden getting a shot away, Schar makes a reckless foul challenge. Two panellists supported the decision as contact was a consequence of the momentum of the blocking action, and not clearly reckless.\"10. Wolves 1-4 Man Utd: Agbadou handballEmmanuel Agbadou angled his body into the path of a shot to stop the ball, but VAR Stuart Attwell did not send referee Michael Salisbury to the monitor.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"Agbadou leans in towards the ball with a straight arm and his arm blocks the shot heading towards goal.\"11. Everton 0-1 Arsenal: Gunners get luckyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton could have made it 1-1 from the penalty spot had there been a VAR interventionEverton were losing 1-0 when William Saliba and Thierno Barry went for a bouncing ball. Barry got there first and was kicked by the Arsenal defender. The VAR, Michael Salisbury, decided there wasn't enough contact to send referee Sam Barrott to the screen.On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"A late challenge where Saliba carelessly kicks Barry with no contact on the ball. Two panellists supported the on-field no penalty call as they felt there was not enough impact and a delayed reaction.\"12. Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth: Gusto avoids another spot-kickFor the second time the VAR failed to intervene to award a penalty against Gusto.It was 2-2 in the 54th minute when Marcus Tavernier played a long cross to David Brooks. Gusto jumped to head it and the ball landed on his outstretched arm.The VAR, Craig Pawson, wrongly determined that the ball had hit the Chelsea player too high on the arm for handball.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel felt that the ball hit the 'red zone' of his arm that was raised in an unjustifiable position.\"13. Brentford 0-0 Tottenham: Romero escapes redImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham would have had to play for 10 men for almost 40 minutes had Cristian Romero been sent offIgor Thiago ran on to a ball over the top in the 56th minute, with Tottenham defender Cristian Romero making a wild swipe to try to intercept.Romero made no contact on the ball and brought down the Brentford striker. The VAR, Alex Chilowicz, felt there was no clear and obvious error in not giving the foul.  On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Romero doesn't play the ball and then brings down Thiago,  who has a high likelihood of gaining control of the ball, travelling towards goal, with no covering defenders.\"How clubs have been affectedThe number of mistakes only tell part of the story. It is just as important when they happened.For instance, the one error Brighton suffered came late in a game at Chelsea which they went on to win 3-1. The mistake had no impact upon the result. Errors suffered:Bournemouth 2Brentford 2Manchester United 2Brighton 1Crystal Palace 1Everton 1Fulham 1Liverpool 1Manchester City 1Wolves 1Bournemouth, Brentford and Manchester United have suffered two VAR errors. Manchester United would argue that had Brentford been reduced to 10 men they would have had a better chance of rescuing the game. Their other error came in a 4-1 win at Wolves.Brentford have experience of this too, as Spurs should have had 10 men for most of the second half in that match. Their second error suffered came in the win against Newcastle.Bournemouth were affected when West Ham's Kilman was not sent off after conceding a penalty in the 69th minute of a 2-2 draw. They should also have had a penalty at Chelsea in a game which was also 2-2.Errors gained from:Chelsea 3Bournemouth 2Newcastle 2Arsenal 1Brentford 1Everton 1Tottenham 1West Ham 1Wolves 1Chelsea have gained the most from errors. Their home win over Fulham and draw with Bournemouth could have had different outcomes if the VAR had got the decisions correct.Bournemouth twice should have had Senesi sent off: in the 3-3 at Crystal Palace and the loss at Liverpool.Newcastle should have conceded an early penalty in their win over Manchester City, though they lost at Brentford.Arsenal, Brentford and Everton benefited in games they won; Tottenham's and West Ham's came in draws.VAR decisions by club so far this seasonWhat about all the other mistakes?The second category is mistakes on the field which the KMI Panel felt did not reach the threshold for a VAR intervention.There have been 15 this season, compared to 12 in 2024-25.The 15 are:Man City v Tottenham: Penalty not given for a foul on Oscar BobbBrentford v Aston Villa: Goal disallowed for a push on Emiliano MartinezArsenal v Leeds: Penalty given for a foul on Max DowmanFulham v Man Utd: Goal awarded despite push on Calvin BasseySunderland v Brentford: Penalty not given for Reinildo holding Nathan CollinsWest Ham v Tottenham: Disallowed goal for a foul by Micky van de VenMan City v Liverpool: Disallowed goal, Andrew Robertson offside and impactingSunderland v Bournemouth: Penalty given for a foul on ReinildoChelsea v Arsenal: Enzo Fernandez offside and impacting on Trevoh Chalobah goalTottenham v Brentford: No Cristian Romero serious foul play red cardFulham v Crystal Palace: Penalty not given for challenge by Joachim AndersenLiverpool v Brighton: No serious foul play red card for Diego GomezNewcastle v Chelsea: No penalty for challenge on Anthony GordonWolves v Brentford: Penalty award for foul by Caoimhin KelleherBrentford v Tottenham: No penalty for a foul on Archie GrayIf a decision has not appeared on this page then the KMI Panel voted it correct on the field and through VAR.Missed second yellow cardsThe panel has ruled that five players have escaped a second caution. At the halfway stage of 2024-25 there had been eight errors.This season's list is: Malick Thiaw for Newcastle at BournemouthAndre for Wolves at Aston VillaAaron Wan-Bissaka for West Ham at Manchester UnitedRuben Dias for Manchester City at Nottingham ForestMikel Merino for Arsenal at home to Aston Villa",

    "body": "40 minutes agoNeil HendersonBBC News, Stratford Magistrates' CourtBBCFrom left to right: Kristofer Deichler, Jatinder Kamra, and Sukhraj SinghThree men have been found guilty of harassing a BBC journalist who presented the podcast series and documentary A Very British Cult.Kristofer Deichler, 47, Jatinder Kamra, 46 and Sukhraj Singh, 39, were all convicted at Stratford Magistrates' Court of harassment without violence.All three are members of Lighthouse, which was investigated for the 2023 documentary and podcast fronted by BBC journalist Catrin Nye.The programmes raised concerns about the group and reported allegations about the way its leadership treated people who tried to leave it.A district judge sitting at Stratford Magistrates Court heard how the men held demonstrations outside the BBC and on three occasions turned up to Nye's home, claiming to be delivering a Bible and a letter.Prosecutor Simren Singh said the group's complaints about Nye's programme-making had begun before the episodes were even released.Judge Susan Holdham heard how attempts by the programme-makers to obtain an interview with the Lighthouse leader, Paul Waugh, had either been met with silence or demands for several hours of live primetime television.The court heard how the men turned up at BBC presenter Catrin Nye's home After the broadcast, Lighthouse staged demonstrations outside the BBC's offices in central London. The group's members held up placards accusing both the corporation and Nye of shielding child abusers and racists.The court was also shown a video featuring group members chanting: \"Stop paedophilia at the BBC.\"Lighthouse followers were seen shouting at BBC staff, accusing them of being \"complicit\" and asking \"don't you have any shame?\"The prosecutor told the judge that while these protests were lawful, the men \"crossed the line\" when they began visiting Nye's home in the summer of 2024.It was then that protests became illegal, he said, telling the court it was \"revenge\" for her journalism.It emerged in court that Lighthouse had hired a private investigator to trace Nye's home address.Members of the group then travelled to her house. They rang the doorbell and recorded themselves on their phones apparently trying to deliver a Bible and a letter.Three men charged with harassment of BBC presenterWhen there was no response they posted leaflets to neighbours and staged a demonstration nearby.They returned several days later, at 08:00, waiting until Nye's partner had left the house with their two small children before calling again. Nye, who was in the house with a security guard, didn't answer the door.The men claimed they had been attempting to produce their own documentary in response to A Very British Cult and said they had been acting as \"citizen journalists\".They described the group's relationship with the BBC and Nye as a \"David versus Goliath\" struggle.\"The purpose was doorstepping,\" Sukhraj Singh told the judge. \"The purpose was to interview any of her team. We wanted justice, compensation, reform and truth.\"He told the court he had joined Lighthouse as a mentor and then became an associate partner in 2010.After the programme's broadcast, he said many of his clients had cut their ties with him, leaving him without an income. He said he was currently living on benefits.Asked what justice would look like, he replied: \"Justice would be for the BBC to apologise and broadcast the facts to the audience.\"Instead of posting the letter and Bible through the letterbox, the court heard the men instead left an unsigned note saying they would \"be back\".Police have released footage showing Kristofer Deichler and Jatinder Kamra outside Nye's homeEarlier in the trial, both Nye and her partner gave evidence from behind a screen about the effects the visits had on them and their children.Nye said Lighthouse had been given \"multiple opportunities and deadline extensions to involve themselves in the production of the programme, and these were not responded to\".She added: \"Terrifying people in their neighbourhood and terrifying their children is not how you respond to an organisation.\"They distributed leaflets with my name and picture on it, said the most awful things possible, saying that I destroyed businesses and protected child abusers.\"The couple installed a Ring doorbell and CCTV in their house and Nye told the court how she became unwilling to leave home with her children, even for short trips. She was reduced to a \"paranoid\" state, the court heard.The case, which was initially scheduled to last four days, instead involved hearings staggered over several months.The defendants at first said they were ill. Proceedings were then further delayed when the men lost their legal representation in a dispute with their original solicitors.Finding all three men guilty, the judge said the visits to the journalist's house \"were intimidatory as well as retaliatory\" and that their conduct amounted to harassment.The three men were bailed and will be sentenced on 2 February.A BBC spokesperson welcomed the verdicts, adding: \"A free and independent press is fundamental to a democratic society, and it is essential that journalists are able to carry out their work without intimidation, harassment or abuse.\"We stand firmly behind our reporter and our journalists' right to report freely in the public interest.\"",

    "body": "The UK government has summoned the Iranian ambassador in response to the ongoing \"brutal\" killings of protesters in the country, the foreign secretary has said.Thousands of people are feared dead or have been detained after a crackdown on anti-government protesters across Iran in recent days.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper outlined \"the UK's total abhorrence of the killings, the violence, and the repression that we are seeing\", and said she feared the death toll may be significantly higher than reported so far.She also said the government would implement \"full and further sanctions\" against Iran targeting finance, energy, transport, software and other significant industries.The Foreign Office has not specifically set out what form the new sanctions will take or when they will be put in place.Cooper, who spoke directly to the Iranian foreign minister on Monday to convey the UK's objections to the crackdown, said the decision to summon the ambassador on Tuesday came following \"horrific reports\" of violence overnight and to \"underline the gravity of the moment\". The protests, which began in December, were initially driven by economic hardship and rising inflation, but have since broadened into more widespread anti-regime rallies.In response, Tehran's security forces have hit back with heavy force, with live ammunition being used against crowds and a wave of arrests being made.Last Thursday, Iranian authorities also imposed a near total internet blackout in an effort to suppress the unrest. As a result, Iranians have been almost completely cut off from the outside world. The country restricts international news organisations from operating there, hampering efforts to independently verify the number of people who have died during the protests.Cooper said the Iranian government was \"peddling its manufactured narrative of foreign manipulation\" and had portrayed protesters as criminals and terrorists.She added: \"The United Kingdom condemns in the strongest of terms the horrendous and brutal killing of Iranian protesters, and we demand that the Iranian authorities respect the fundamental rights and freedoms of their citizens.\"Cooper also said British officials were in contact with Iranian counterparts about UK nationals detained there.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDavid DeansWales political reporterA Reform politician who was suspended from Wales' parliament for using a racial slur about Chinese people has denied she is racist.Laura Anne Jones told BBC Radio Wales that the offensive word she used in a WhatsApp chat \"was a term used for a takeaway\" during her childhood.The former Conservative said she was \"genuinely sorry\" for using the slur in August 2023, had since undergone language training, and vowed not to use the word again.Members of the Chinese community told the BBC in December that the use of the term had caused \"a lot of hurt\".Jones, Reform's only Member of the Senedd (MS), was banned from the Senedd for two weeks last year.Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast for the first time since her suspension, the MS for South East Wales said: \"I shouldn't have said those words. I didn't mean anything by it.\"Asked why she used it, she said: \"Growing up around here, when I was young, which is a long time ago now - I'm 46 - language was very different and that was a term used for a takeaway.\"I'm not going to sit here and make excuses because I'm genuinely sorry for that.\"I've done language training as my staff, and it will never happen again.\"I'll be very, very careful of language that I use. I never wanted to hurt anyone and that was never the intention.\"Jones said she had \"done a lot with the Chinese community, in the past and since, in Newport... and I've had a good relationship with them\".\"I will always be supportive of everybody in this country,\" she added.\"I am not a racist by any stretch of the imagination.\"Jones's pay was docked and she could not take part in proceedings in the Senedd during her suspension in December.It followed an investigation by the standards commissioner, who found she had broken the code of conduct, but cleared her of making fraudulent expenses claims.Last year the Chinese in Wales Association (CIWA) welcomed the action taken by the Senedd, but said the term Jones used carried \"deeply hurtful and racist connotations\" and it was \"deeply disappointing to hear such language from an elected representative\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandKoh EweProsecutors have asked for South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol to be handed a death sentence if he is found guilty over his botched attempt to impose martial law.A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the \"ringleader of an insurrection\". The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial.Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party.Leading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries the death penalty or life imprisonment and under South Korean law prosecutors must ask the judge for one or the other for the crime of insurrection.South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. They called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers. They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of \"disposing\" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers.Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho.A verdict and sentencing for Yoon and the other defendants, if they are convicted, is expected at a later date - widely expected to be in February.Yoon has been detained for months while facing several criminal trials. Last month, prosecutors sought a 10-year prison term for Yoon for obstruction of justice and other charges related to his martial law attempt.On 3 December 2024, Yoon shocked the country - and the world - by declaring martial law over South Korea. He said at the time it was to protect the country from North Korean communist forces, but some saw it as a ploy by Yoon to get a grip on power amid domestic political woes.The short-lived martial law declaration sent South Korea into months of political turmoil, while Yoon became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged.South Korea's incumbent president, Lee Jae Myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment.Despite his downfall, Yoon retains loyal supporters in right-wing circles who see him as a martyr who dared to rail against the liberal Democratic Party led by Lee.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent The next stage of a new law being designed to stop cover-ups has been temporarily delayed after MPs raised concerns about whether it would apply fully to the security services. Last week, families of Manchester Arena attack victims wrote to the prime minister urging him to ensure the so-called Hillsborough Law applied to individual employees of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.A third reading of the bill was scheduled for Wednesday, but the government has confirmed the remaining stages will now take place next Monday, allowing time for amendments to be considered.Earlier, a government source told the BBC the delay would allow further \"tweaking\" of the bill to address issues raised by MPs.The prime minister's official spokesperson said on Tuesday: \"This government will not bring forward legislation that would put the national security of the UK or lives at risk.\"On Friday, we brought forward a series of amendments to address concerns that the bill did not apply to individual employees of the intelligence agencies. But we're determined to get this right.\"The government will \"continue to listen to stakeholders on all sides of the debate to make sure the bill strikes the careful balance that is required\", No 10 added.Earlier, sources told the BBC the reading had been pushed back because of growing concern from MPs of different parties.The new law follows campaigning by families affected by the 1989 Hillsborough disaster that claimed 97 lives.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about that disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.It has also been supported by the families of victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out that attack.The law will create a new legal duty on public bodies and servants to act truthfully and fully support investigations into the state, ensuring wrongdoing is not concealed with criminal sanctions for breaches. However, as things stand, the ancillary \"duty of candour\" will not fully apply to individual MI5 officers, unlike people who work for organisations such as the police.Pete Weatherby KC, a director of the Hillsborough Law Now (HLN) campaign which is assisting with the bill, told the BBC he had been \"misled\" by the government during negotiations.He said the campaigners had agreed a position where a key part of the law would apply to individual intelligence officers, but the government then added a \"buried\" clause to the draft legislation that would prevent it from working as intended.It is understood that ministers are considering amendments suggested by HLN. The campaigners have opposed the government's own amendments.Known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, the new law has three pillars:The first establishes a general duty of candour on all public officials, meaning they will be required to tell the truth proactively in their working lifeThe second is an ancillary duty of candour that applies to official investigations, which includes inquiries and inquestsThe third is set to re-balance funding for legal representation for state bodies and victims during inquiriesIn their letter to Sir Keir Starmer last week, the families of five people killed in the Manchester bombing asked: \"How many times must MI5 show that it cannot be trusted before something is done?\"They added that they were \"dismayed\" that the current way the draft bill was written would allow MI5 and other intelligence organisations to \"escape the full duty of candour responsibility\".\"Every security and intelligence officer should be required the tell the truth, and the leaders of the organisations should also bear full responsibility,\" they wrote.They have yet to receive a response.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoKaty AustinTransport correspondentThe government is set to announce its intention to build a new rail link between Birmingham and Manchester, the BBC understands.Previous plans for the HS2 high-speed rail line had included a line between the two cities, but that part of the project was scrapped by Rishi Sunak's government.On Wednesday, the government is also expected to confirm proposals for new and improved rail links across the North of England in a scheme known as Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR).Little detail about a new Birmingham to Manchester route is anticipated, other than the intention to build it after NPR is completed, meaning it may not happen for decades.Plans to bring high-speed rail to the north of England were first put forward by former Conservative chancellor George Osborne in 2014.The existing West Coast main line is very crowded and ministers acknowledge the need to increase capacity at some point.  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has supported the idea of an alternative new line between Birmingham and Manchester.A new rail line between Liverpool and Manchester is seen a central piece of the overall Northern Powerhouse rail project, which is aimed at cutting travel times between northern cities and towns as well as boosting the UK economy outside of London.But expected announcements from the current government were put on ice several times last year due to cost concerns.Insiders said an extended review process of the project was under way in a bid to avoid mistakes made with HS2, which has been dogged by problems and costly delays.HS2 is currently tens of billions of pounds over budget and around a decade behind schedule.Reports state that the now-shortened line between Birmingham and London could cost £81bn.Accounting for inflation, that would mean at least £100bn will be spent but only 135 miles of railway built.HS2 Ltd, the company created by the Department for Transport, has accepted it failed to keep overall costs under control and said delivery has not matched what it described as the unrealistic early expectations.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitics reporterHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has urged Labour colleagues to stop making excuses and blaming the system for the slow pace of change in public services.\"This excuses culture does the centre-left no favours,\" Streeting told a think tank conference. \"If we tell the public that we can't make anything work, then why on earth would they vote to keep us in charge?\"It comes after a former close aide to Sir Keir Starmer claimed the government had been \"hobbled\" by regulators, campaign groups and other \"stakeholders\" who had a vested interested in preserving the status quo. Writing in The Times, Paul Ovenden, who quit as Sir Keir's director of political strategy last September after offensive messages he had sent in 2017 surfaced, said the British state had got \"bigger and bigger while simultaneously and systematically emasculating itself\".He claimed there was now \"a political perma-class that exists within every party and every department – one whose entire focus is on preserving their status within a system that gives them meaning\".The prime minister has also spoken of his frustration at the obstacles standing in the way of change.He told MPs on the Commons liaison committee last month:  \"Every time I go to pull a lever there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations, [and] arm's-length bodies that mean that the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be.\"Streeting did not mention Sir Keir by name in his speech at the Institute for Government (IFG) annual conference - but his remarks will be interpreted as a shot across the PM's bows, amid continued speculation that the health secretary is preparing to mount a leadership challenge.He said: \"We are not simply at the mercy of forces outside of our control. Our fortunes are in our hands. \"And it is precisely because we on centre-left believe in the power of the state to transform people's lives, that we are best placed to change it.\"He added: \"Where there aren't levers, we build them. Where there are barriers, we bulldoze them. Where there is poor performance, we challenge it.\"He said reform of public services was \"one of the greatest challenges of our age\". \"Failure in this area has led to disaffection, cynicism, and ultimately the rise of populists,\" he added.He expanded on the theme in a Q&A with journalists, warning that \"giving the public this sense that you elect people to do things and change things and then say 'actually I don't think we have got any agency to do that' - well then why bother? Why bother voting?\"This was a \"really bad place for a democracy to be\", he argued, adding that the answer was for the government to \"assert ourselves confidently with the right set of values\".His comments were echoed by Dame Louise Casey, who was last year brought in by Sir Keir to drive through his \"plan for change\" as the government's lead non-executive director. She told the IFG conference the government needed to \"just stop\" complaining about how difficult it was to change things and urged civil servants to adopt a \"grip it and fix it\" culture instead.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats have set out a £1.5bn plan to give patients in England a legal right to be admitted or referred for treatment within 12 hours of arriving at A&E, to end what they have called a \"deadly corridor crisis\".In a speech, party leader Sir Ed Davey called for a new legal duty to limit the time patients wait to be admitted, transferred or discharged after arriving in A&E.The Lib Dems say their plan would be funded by scrapping a UK-US pharmaceuticals deal, which could see the NHS pay billions more for drugs.The Department of Health and Social Care said the government had invested an extra £26bn in the NHS and argued it would \"take time to turn around the mess we inherited\".The number of patients waiting more than 12 hours for admission to A&E has increased substantially since the pandemic in 2021.The latest NHS figures from November show 50,648 people in England waited more than 12 hours following a decision to admit them to hospital.There were an estimated 16,644 excess deaths associated with long A&E waits before admission in England in 2024, according to analysis by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine.Sir Ed said: \"This deadly corridor crisis isn't befitting of the heroic doctors, nurses and other health professionals who work in our NHS.\"It's not what we expect from our NHS, and it's not what we pay our hard-earned money in taxes to fund our NHS for.\"The Lib Dems say they will raise £1.5bn from cancelling the planned medicines deal the UK government agreed with President Donald Trump's US administration last year.The agreement keeps American imports of UK medicines tariff-free for three years in return for the NHS raising its threshold for spending on new treatments by 25%.In December, the Financial Times reported the Department of Health and Social Care estimates the deal will see medicines spending rise by £1.5bn over the next three years.The Lib Dems say the clawed-back £1.5bn would make around 6,000 more beds available each day by expanding hospital capacity and creating social care beds for patients waiting on long-term care decisions.Under the party's plans, more places would be reserved in care homes and funding would be made available for people leaving hospital and carers looking after family members at home.Under the proposals, ministers would have a statutory duty to ensure patients wait no longer than 12 hours to be admitted, transferred or discharged after arriving in A&E.Sir Ed said the party's package of proposals \"could put an end to 12-hour A&E waits altogether, by the end of the year\".\"Never again should anyone have to watch their loved one die on a trolley in a hospital corridor,\" he addedAsked by the BBC if the plans were ambitious enough, Sir Ed said his party would go further to end long waits in A&E if it was in government.\"We need to get back to four hour waits and less,\" Sir Ed said.\"We're the only party talking about it. We want to raise it and show it can be tackled in a year.\"Getting the NHS \"back on its feet\" after the pandemic, which increased pressures on the health service, is one of the Labour government's biggest priorities.In its 2024 election manifesto, Labour said its immediate priority on health will be to \"get a grip on the record waiting lists\" and \"return to meeting NHS performance standards\".Labour's main focus has been getting waiting times down for non-urgent, consultant-led treatments.NHS waiting lists for those treatments remain high, with around 7.4 million people waiting as of late 2025, significantly above pre-pandemic levels, though slightly down from peak backlogs after Covid-19.On A&E treatment, last year the government said it would invest more than £450m on expanding urgent and emergency care facilities to provide faster care for patients.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said even in the NHS's best days \"there will still have been patients on trolleys in corridors being treated in conditions that fall short of my ambitions and expectations for our health service\".He said during his tenure as health secretary so far, he had \"sought to get the balance right - being proud of our progress without overselling the success and being honest about our shortcomings and challenges without fuelling pessimism and defeatism\".A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said \"corridor care is unacceptable\".\"That's why this government is tackling the situation by delivering 500,000 more vaccinations compared to last year, building new same day emergency centres, mental health crisis centres, and deploying 500 brand new ambulances,\" the spokesperson said.\"In addition, we've struck a deal on medicine pricing that puts patients first and strengthens our life sciences sector, all without taking essential funding from our frontline services.\"The Conservatives, who were in government during the pandemic, have been approached for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterImprovements to a number of Apple services - including a more personalised version of its virtual assistant, Siri - are to be powered with AI provided by Google.The tech giants have announced a \"multi-year collaboration\" which will see the iPhone-maker base some of its key tech on Google's Gemini AI models.In a joint statement, the two firms said the partnership would unlock \"innovative new experiences\" for Apple users.However, experts say it demonstrates how Apple's cautious approach to building and rolling out its own AI tools has left it reliant on other companies.\"By outsourcing the foundational layer of its AI to Google, Apple is effectively admitting that its internal efforts couldn't compete with Google's Gemini in terms of capability and scale in the short term,\" IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said.He told the BBC while the move was \"a significant and pragmatic strategy\" for Apple, it also marked a departure from its historic approach to development.\"Apple always preferred to own every layer of its technology,\" he said, adding that doing so \"gave them an edge against their competitors\".Nonetheless he and other analysts say the deal is likely to be welcomed by consumers, noting demand among many iPhone users for AI features as Google, Samsung and other smartphone manufacturers continue to bring these to their handsets.Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore said Apple's latest financial results suggested AI was not the most sought-after feature for people deciding whether to buy an iPhone.But he told the BBC \"this will gradually change as AI-powered services gain adoption\".This is not the first deal Apple has struck with an AI firm. It unveiled a similar partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in June 2024, which made the popular chatbot available as part of its suite of generative AI tools, Apple Intelligence.Google and Apple said in a joint statement on Monday that Apple Intelligence would continue to operate in Apple's Private Cloud Compute system.\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,\" they said.\"Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"Not much is known about Google and Apple's deal beyond Monday's joint statement - including how much it is worth.But previous deals to bring Google software to Apple devices have been valued at billions of dollars.Jeronimo said while iPhone users already familiar with Google products and practices may not be overly concerned by its AI powering some Apple features, it was \"likely to be a red flag\" for regulators.Prior to a US judge ruling in August 2024 Google had operated an illegal online search monopoly, it was revealed it had paid more than $26bn in 2021 alone to firms including Apple to make its search engine the default option on iPhones.EU and UK regulators have previously expressed concern over and investigated big tech deals out of fears they could leverage their size, wealth and market power to maintain dominance in certain sectors.UK regulator the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in October Apple and Google both held \"an effective duopoly\" in the UK.It designated Apple and Google as having \"strategic market status\" - a move which means it can demand changes at firms it decides have too much market power.The BBC has approached the CMA for comment.",

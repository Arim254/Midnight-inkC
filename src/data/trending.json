    "body": "Norris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'Media caption, 'Winning made everything worth it' - Norris on F1 title and what's to come in the futureByF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiLando Norris says he is looking forward to switching off and forgetting all about the year in which he achieved his lifetime's ambition of winning the Formula 1 World Championship.The McLaren driver spent Sunday night into Monday morning celebrating in Abu Dhabi, before digesting his triumph with BBC Sport in a hotel on Yas Island, a stone's throw from the F1 track.Norris is relaxed, good humoured and chatty as he reviews his journey.Next, he is heading to the McLaren factory, to analyse this year, and for work in the simulator, already thinking about next season.There are more celebrations to come this week, including picking up the official championship trophy at a prizegiving ceremony in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Friday, before the McLaren Christmas party in London on Saturday.And then, breathe.\"Honestly,\" Norris says, \"try to forget this season, try to forget a little bit what we've been able to achieve together. Forget that I drive in Formula 1.\"I don't want to forget what we've achieved this season, but just try to live a normal few days of the year, and go play some golf and do some normal things and that's it.\"The realisation of what he has achieved is beginning to dawn on the 26-year-old Briton but he says he \"still finds it very surreal\".\"I was just by the pool earlier,\" he says. \"And when someone says, 'Congrats, world champ' or something, it's definitely got a very different ring to it (than) when it's just 'Congrats, Lando,' or whatever it may be.\"I don't know. It's such a sizeable achievement.\"Making parents proud 'the best thing you can ask for'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris is embraced by his mum Cisca and dad Adam just after the conclusion of the Abu Dhabi Grand PrixAt the celebrations, and waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel, were his father Adam and mother Cisca. The family are wealthy, thanks to Adam Norris' success as a pension trader, which made him a multi-millionaire.But becoming an elite sportsman still means starting learning your trade at a very young age, and a lot of personal sacrifices.\"Everything is different for everyone,\" he says, \"so the sacrifices you've made are just very different sacrifices to all the people in the world have made. So I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"But still as a family you want to spend time together. And that's something we've not really done a lot of since I started when I was like seven, eight years old.\"My dad was taking me everywhere. I spent a lot more time with my dad than I did with my mum. My mum was at home looking after my sisters.\"I see my mum 20 days a year maybe, something like that. Which is not a lot.\"But certainly winning and having the achievement we did yesterday made everything feel more worth it, all those times away.\"One thing that everyone wants to do, is make their parents proud. So the fact I got to do that yesterday, I hope make them even more proud, is the best thing you can ask for.\"Proving himself wrong and 'a brutal honesty'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris, then 15, celebrates winning the 2015 MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship) - 10 years before he reached the pinnacle of motorsportNorris says he's \"seen a lot of photos over the last 12 hours; a lot of little me\".One of them is of him doing donuts in a kart when he was still a small boy. What would he tell little Lando if he could talk to him now?\"Probably just to have a bit more belief in myself,\" he says, \"because it's something I never really had when I was younger. It's something I always lacked.\"In that video, I was so small. I was never the big kid or never the aggressive one, that kind of thing. I'm still the same, I think, now. I would just get my elbows out a little bit more. That's probably my only thing.\"This sort of vulnerability is Norris' trademark. It was evident after the race, too, when he said he was \"proud that I've proved myself wrong\".I ask what he meant, and he says it was a reference to his difficult first part of the season, when his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took the initiative, and the championship lead, and had won four races before Norris had taken his second.By the time of the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, Piastri had a 34-point lead over Norris and seemed a certain bet for the title, only for Norris to rally and overhaul it all.\"When Oscar was doing a better job than me and I wasn't doing a great job, I was like, 'Well, you know, maybe they're just a bit better. Maybe they can just be more consistent, get more out of the car,'\" Norris says.\"I just never thought at times that it was possible. So for me to then do that for myself, to kind of go, 'You're wrong, you can do it,' is a pretty incredible feeling to have for yourself.\"I wouldn't say I'm a very selfish person, but I've also learned at times I almost have to be more selfish with some of these feelings and thoughts. I need that to almost make me a better and stronger driver.\"It's just nice to almost make myself have more confidence. But I often only do that when I prove it to myself. I've always had that thought of, 'Oh, the next step is such a big leap. Am I ever going to be able to perform at the level I need to perform at?' I have more doubts than positive thoughts at those times.\"But I've also changed a lot this season. I also feel through the year I've been able to be in a much better place, be a lot more confident in myself, change my whole approach and mentality.\"It's a trademark of all great F1 drivers that they look hard at themselves, analyse their weaknesses, and work out ways to improve, and keep doing it throughout their career.Norris is unusual, though, in that he speaks about that process so openly. Why?\"Great question,\" he says. \"I don't know, truthfully. I don't know why sometimes I tell you guys as much stuff as I do.\"Sometimes I get told I shouldn't and sometimes I probably do tell too much, or reveal too much, and people can see vulnerabilities in that and so forth.\"Maybe at times that's a mistake. But at the same time at least I'm being truthful to my own self. If I'm doing a bad job, I tell myself I'm doing a bad job and I certainly have people around me telling me the truth about things.\"What I hate the most is the opposite, is doing a bad job and someone going, 'That's all right, you'll be fine, things will just get better.' Because it's just not the case.\"I hate that kind of mentality and approach, and I've certainly not been brought up in that way. People around me have certainly not been like that.\"It's very much a brutal honesty which has made me the person I am today. But I'm also just I think quite an open, honest person, I will just say what I believe.\"How Monaco lap made him cry and 'flipped everything'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris set a new track record of 1:09.954 in taking pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix in MayNorris has achieved so much this year. Along with the world title, he has won the two races every driver dreams of winning - Monaco and his home grand prix at Silverstone.What else is there left to do? He smiles.\"I would have loved to make my life a bit easier and win it just earlier next time,\" he says. \"But I won ones that people have dreams of winning. They're some of the most incredible ones.\"The lap I did in Monaco in qualifying was the only other time probably in the last 10 years that I cried a little bit over something.\"It was the one other moment this season that I proved myself wrong, because I had that bad run of results.\"I just couldn't perform in qualifying. Qualifying has always been my strong suit, my best. It's been my strength since I was in karting. All my qualifying results are my thing and they weren't at the beginning of the season.\"I went to the hardest track to do a qualifying lap. It's not been my best track in the past.\"I turned off my (lap time cockpit display) delta for the first time that weekend so I couldn't see if I was on a better lap, worse lap, whatever it was.\"For me to then to go there and put in that lap at the end of qualifying was one of the best moments of my career, because it was the time I almost doubted myself the most ever, in the most important season that it turned out to be.\"But that one lap - one minute nine seconds - was all it needed for me to flip everything and turn that thought of 'I just don't know if I've got this' to 'I can definitely do this'. That was a pivotal moment for me up here (he points to his head).\"We end by discussing what he will take from this year into next. And he gives another revealing answer.\"I take a lot,\" he says, \"plenty of things that I know I could have done better, I should have done better.\"But I did what I had to in the end. It was crazy close. Two points is all it was to Max (Verstappen). That's pretty insane, especially when he was so far back.\"What do I take? I take that I can do it. I do have what it takes.\"I had my flaws. I had my mistakes. But I'm confident, and I have the confidence now that I can look at them, review them, analyse them, not make them again and do even better next season.\"",

    "body": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot says he is \"not weak\" and denies the situation with Mohamed Salah has undermined his authority.The 33-year-old winger has been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday after giving an explosive interview two days ago, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with Slot had broken down.Slot says he does not feel that way and was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments.Speaking in Milan on Monday night, Slot added he had \"no clue\" if Salah, who signed a new two-year contract in April, had played his last game for Liverpool, but added he was a \"firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player\".He said his conversation with Salah to tell him he would not travel to Milan was \"a short one\".\"Usually I am calm and polite, but that doesn't mean I am weak,\" he said.\"If a player has these commands about so many things, then it's about me and the club to react. We reacted in way you can see - he's not here.\"He added: \"I don't feel my authority is undermined, it is not the way I feel it.\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player. I have no clue [if he has played his last game for Liverpool] - I cannot answer that question at this point in time.\"Salah said in his interview it was \"very clear that someone wants me to get all the blame\", but Slot says he does not know if that comment was aimed at him and gave his reasons for leaving Salah out for the past three games.\"It is hard for me to know who he was talking about,\" Slot said.\"That is not the way I feel. He has the right to feel the way he does, but he does not have the right to share it with the media.\"He was very respectful and has trained really hard before the weekend - to that extent it was a surprise to me the comments he gave.\"Yes, we were [on speaking terms] but it doesn't mean we were always agreeing on things.\"But it is not the first or the last time that a player who is not playing has said something similar to that.\"We as a team have struggled this season. I have tried to come up with solutions - that is my job. We tried many things and we looked very vulnerable against Nottingham Forest and PSV so I decided to play with an extra midfielder.\"Sources told BBC Sport the decision to leave Salah at home was taken with the full support of Slot, and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for the player to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of his public comments.It is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.Egypt forward Salah departs for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to also miss Liverpool's Premier League home game against Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).Salah has scored 250 goals for Liverpool since signing from Roma in 2017, but has just five in 19 games this season.Slot has named a 19-man squad for Tuesday, with the Reds also missing forwards Cody Gakpo and Federico Chiesa, and defensive midfielder Wataru Endo.Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson says Salah's team-mates \"have different thoughts\" about his outburst, but the Brazil international wants the winger to return.\"This is not a situation that makes us happy, first and foremost because on a personal level we all love Mo,\" he said.\"We were a little bit caught by surprise but we know it is a personal situation so we are leaving it between him and the club.\"What we believe does not come into things. What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff.\"I hope he plays again for the club.\"He added: \"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"Alisson also backed his manager Slot, adding: \"We believe [in] his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.\"Almost 48 hours after Salah spoke, this was Arne Slot's chance to say his piece.Monday was a public holiday in Milan but the media conference room inside the San Siro was still packed. It is hard to think of a more anticipated pre-match media conference in recent times.Slot used his humour to start off by joking with a reporter that he asked five questions in one, but minute by minute, details began to emerge and it was clear to see who was in charge.When BBC Sport asked him whether he understood Salah's comments when the Egyptian said he was \"thrown under the bus\", Slot said: \"Usually I'm calm, I'm polite but I'm not weak. If a player has these comments about so many things, then it's up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see because he's not here.\"This was Slot on the front foot and he was backed later by goalkeeper Alisson, who insisted that the Liverpool squad are firmly behind the manager who won the Premier League.That backing from a senior player was crucial on a night where Slot was asked if he felt his authority was undermined by the whole saga.Slot categorically denied he felt that way, even if he was surprised when he heard the quotes on Saturday night.The Liverpool coach did not delve too much into the specifics, insisting that his conversation with Salah was short, but he said enough to explain the situation without inflaming it any further.And, importantly, the door is still open for Salah even though Slot said he had \"no clue\" whether the 33-year-old has played his last game for the club.The club insist this was mainly because of Salah bringing his own future into question. Their position is that Salah still has a contract and as Slot said, he is a \"firm believer\" in the possibility for a player to return.After 10 minutes of questions solely focused on Salah, the Liverpool media officer, sat next to Slot, was adamant it was time to move on to questions about the game itself.Ultimately though, regardless of how Liverpool fare tomorrow against Inter Milan, this is a story that will continue to dominate the agenda until there is a clear resolution.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe Guardian leads with Sir Keir Starmer hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and senior European leaders at Downing Street, in what it calls \"a critical moment\" for the embattled country. The leaders are hoping to achieve a \"breakthrough\" by giving Ukraine \"access to billions of pounds of frozen Russian assets\", the paper writes. Sir Keir believes \"a deal to unlock £100bn for Ukraine\" could occur \"within days\" following the meeting at Number 10, the Times reports. The leaders of the UK, France, and Germany will push for the frozen Russian funds - currently sitting in European bank accounts - to be freed, an approach which faces opposition from Belgium over concerns it could be \"legally liable for a sum equal to a third of its annual GDP\".The Independent leads on Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper warning of \"escalating\" Russian cyber attacks. In a major speech today, Cooper will tell diplomats that there is an increased danger of \"hybrid threats\" - both physical and cyber - from hostile states, \"designed to weaken critical national infrastructure, undermine our interests and interfere in our democracies\". \"Paramount gatecrashes Netflix deal,\" is the lead for the Financial Times, which reports on the streaming giant's $108bn (£81bn) \"hostile bid\" for Warner Bros Discovery. It says Paramount is \"teaming up with Middle East sovereign wealth funds and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to derail Netflix's agreed deal\".\"Sir Keir Tiktoking rubbish!\" trumpets the Daily Star, which writes the prime minister has become \"the first PM to join TikTok despite huge fears over the Chinese app\". Experts warn policies of \"capping pension salary sacrifice schemes and slashing the tax-free limit for cash ISAs\" will \"delay UK retirement age\", the i Paper reports. Economists tell the paper the Budget policies could lead to \"threadbare private pension pots\" adding \"pressure on the state system\".The Daily Telegraph leads with claims that \"gangs offer free crossings to asylum seekers if they carry drugs across Channel\". The paper's investigation, which it has shared with the Home Office and National Crime Agency (NCA), suggests some groups offer \"VIP crossings\" for those willing to act as \"drug mules\" from northern France. Spokespeople for the NCA and Home Office both tell the paper they do not recognise the practice, while noting they are \"alive\" to drug threats.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch says there must be \"no stone unturned\" in a national inquiry into grooming gangs. The paper writes Badenoch will push for convicted offenders with dual nationality to be \"stripped of their citizenship and deported\".The Daily Mirror leads with the \"unbreakable bond\" forged between the parents of the Southport attack victims who are \"offering comfort in the face of impossible grief\". After sharing baby photos of Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice da Silva Aguiar and Bebe King as part of a BBC documentary, the families say their friendship allows them \"to pull the light out\" of the darkness.\"The head of the Royal Navy unleashed an extraordinary broadside at [Chancellor] Rachel Reeves,\" the Daily Mail writes, accusing the government of failing to properly fund defence. The First Sea Lord Sir Gwyn Jenkins warns \"Russia is spending billions to control North Atlantic\", as the paper features its own campaign titled \"Don't leave Britain defenceless\".Metro leads with police adopting new e-bikes to \"take down gangs\" in London. Gangs ride on similar vehicles capable of reaching 60mph to steal \"bags, watches and phones\" from victims, the paper says. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterDepartment for TransportThe government has unveiled its branding for Great British Railways (GBR), marking a step forward in plans to nationalise the railways.In the past year, the government has taken three rail franchises back into public control, something Labour promised in its manifesto.The new livery and branding uses a red, white and blue colour scheme to mirror the Union Flag and will be used on GBR trains, at stations and on its website and app. While the Budget included plans to freeze rail fares next year, the government has previously said it cannot guarantee customers will see lower prices under renationalisation. The rollout of the design, which was created in-house, is expected to take place gradually, with passengers beginning to see the trains across the national network from next spring. Through December, the design will be displayed at stations, including London Bridge, Birmingham New Street, Glasgow Central, Leeds City, and Manchester Piccadilly.The Railways Bill, which will allow for the creation of GBR, is currently making its way through the House of Commons. The government has said it is renationalising the railways so it is \"owned by the public, delivering for the public, not for private shareholders\".The rollout of GBR will also include an app, which will let customers check train times and book trains without booking fees. Disabled passengers will also be able to use the app to book assistance. Department for TransportA mock up of what the GBR app might look like Seven train operators are already in public hands, accounting for about a third of journeys, with the franchises being acquired as their contracts have expired. Franchises which have been nationalised in the past year include Greater Anglia, South Western Railway, and c2c, with more expected to follow in 2026. The GBR logo is the distinctive double-arrow logo currently used by National Rail, which provides passenger information and tickets, and was created in the 1960s as the logo of British Rail - the state-owned company which previously operated Britain's railways.  Department for TransportTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that the new design \"isn't just a paint job\", and that it represents \"a new railway, casting off the frustrations of the past and focused entirely on delivering a proper public service for passengers\".Jacqueline Starr, executive chair and chief executive of Rail Delivery Group - a collection of Britain's train operators - welcomed the government's commitment to improving services for customers. \"We will continue to work closely with industry partners to support a smooth transition to Great British Railways,\" she said.

    "body": "10 hours agoDaniela Relph,Senior royal correspondentandNoor Nanji,Culture reporterThe Duke of Sussex's access to security when he visits the UK is under review, sources have told the BBC.In May, Prince Harry lost a legal case to have his police protection reinstated when visiting the UK.In a BBC interview after the ruling, he said it was not safe to bring his family back to the country of his birth because he could not guarantee their safety.It is understood a Home Office review will now look at whether he should automatically receive full police protection on visits to the UK even though he is no longer a working member of the royal family.Sources close to the prince say this level of security review is long overdue. According to The Sun newspaper, the process for reassessing the duke's threat level is already under way and a decision is expected next month.King Charles has only met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's children once before. He last saw his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet, during the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022.Prince Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped back from frontline royal duties in 2020 and moved to the US with the Duchess of Sussex.In his legal challenge earlier this year, he contested the decision-making process used by a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office.Ravec had concluded that because Prince Harry was going to be an infrequent visitor to the UK, his security needs would be assessed on a case by case basis.But in doing so, the duke's legal team argued that Ravec did not properly re-assess the threats he faced when considering his situation in 2020.His lawyers had argued that he had been \"singled out\" for \"inferior treatment\", but the court ruling upheld that there had been nothing unlawful about how the decision had been reached.A senior judge ruled that Prince Harry's \"sense of grievance\" over how the decision to alter his security was reached did not amount to a basis for a successful appeal.That decision meant the duke's security remained outside the automatic, high level of protection which is provided for senior royals.Speaking to BBC News in California shortly afterwards, Prince Harry said he was \"devastated\" at losing his appeal.He also said any prospect of a return to the UK for him and his family was \"impossible\" in light of the Court of Appeal ruling, adding: \"I can't see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\"At the time, Buckingham Palace said: \"All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The UK Government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate.\"It is our long-standing policy not to provide detailed information on those arrangements, as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"",

They both remain in custody, the force said.The arrests follow an investigation into an assault at the multi-storey car park at Terminal 3 on Sunday. Prior to the attack, two women were robbed of their suitcases after getting out of a car park lift.A three-year-old girl was among the injured during the incident. Five people went to hospital for treatment and have since been discharged.Officers arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of robbery and assault close to the scene. He has since been released under investigation while inquiries continue.Police were called at about 08:10 GMT following reports of a number of people injured by a noxious substance believed to be pepper spray.The assault - which the Met said was isolated and not being treated as terrorism - resulted in train delays and the partial closure of the Central Terminal Area tunnel and the Terminal 3 car park for a short time.More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterActivewear brand Sweaty Betty has become involved in a new dispute over advertising slogans, which a period underwear company claims were copied.Kelly Newton said Sweaty Betty's use of two taglines that were very similar to her firm Nixi Body's \"seemed a little off\", and while she could not get them trademarked she felt Sweaty Betty was \"taking from\" other female founders.Sweaty Betty said the \"No ifs. Just butt.\" line had been used by many brands and influencers, but also said it was reviewing all its marketing campaigns.Ms Newton said she was speaking out after seeing personal trainer Georgina Cox reveal Sweaty Betty had offered her a settlement over a disputed slogan.Ms Newton, who co-founded Nixi Body in 2019, said the company has advertised its leak-proof period underwear with the lines \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, motherhood and menopause\" and \"No leaks. No ifs. Just butts.\" for years.But late last year a friend alerted her to a Sweaty Betty ad for its femtech range of leak-resistant and maternity leggings with the tagline \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, maternity and menopause\". At first, Ms Newton thought it could have been a coincidence, and said she was annoyed but did not feel there was anything she could do.That tagline has since been changed on the Sweaty Betty website to \"Menstruation. Maternity. Menopause. Together we're raising the bar for every woman, for any life stage.\"Then, earlier this year, she noticed Sweaty Betty was running a campaign with the line \"No ifs. Just butt.\"\"I thought 'oh hang on a second',\" Ms Newton told the BBC.Again, Ms Newton said she didn't reach out. She said she had tried to get the \"Keeping you moving through menstruation, motherhood and menopause\" line trademarked but was unable to do so, and said she knew that legally she had little recourse.\"Legally they were within their rights to use these words, but they're words that we've used for quite a few years.”It was personal trainer Ms Cox sharing her story about dealing with the brand that made her want to speak out, Ms Newton said.Last month Ms Cox revealed that Sweaty Betty had offered her £4,000 in exchange for confidentiality over the use of the phrase \"Wear The Damn Shorts\" that she claims was used without crediting her in its latest campaigns.She told the BBC she came up with the slogan alongside her sister in 2020 and it quickly went viral. In 2023, Sweaty Betty approached her to use it in a campaign and paid her £3,500 to do so. She was also paid for another campaign using it in 2024, but was not approached about it for this year.Ms Newton said she felt compelled to speak out about her experience after talking to Ms Cox, because she was not the only person affected.\"Your tagline can't be empowering all women when actually all you're doing is taking from them,\" she said, adding that she was not seeking compensation but rather for Sweaty Betty to be accountable.\"It just feels like for me all the slogans I'm seeing are coming from other female founders.\"I just want them to do the right thing and just morally acknowledging what they've done isn't great and to do better really.\"Sweaty Betty said it chose words \"to empower women through fitness\" to advertise its femtech range, something many brands try to do, which \"sometimes… means the language used by different brands aligns\".\"We have been using the phrase for over a year and Nixi has not been in touch with us about our use of it. The phrase is used by many brands in various forms and that is why no individual or brand can claim exclusive rights to it or trademark it,\" the company said in a statement.\"It is never our intent to take credit for the work or creativity of others, particularly from trailblazing women, and we have reached out to Nixi Body directly to convey this. We have also been undertaking a review of all our campaigns and marketing language to fully understand the origins of the phrases we use and will continue to do this. \"We note that such a review was conducted with respect to the 'Wear the Damn Shorts' phrase and its origins date back to at least as early as 2019, before either Ms Cox or Sweaty Betty first used the phrase. We continue to work towards a resolution with Ms Cox, as has always been our objective, however this dispute remains ongoing.\"",

    "body": "New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani will live in the Manhattan mansion that his predecessors have called home, leaving behind a rent-stabilised apartment that became the subject of heated debate during his campaign.Gracie Mansion, which dates to 1799, has served at the residence for most New York City mayors since the World War II era. But Mamdani, for whom affordable housing is a central issue, did not confirm he would live there immediately following his victory in November.\"This decision came down to our family's safety and the importance of dedicating all of my focus on enacting the affordability agenda New Yorkers voted for,\" Mamdani said in a statement on Monday.Mamdani lived in the Astoria neighbourhood in the borough of Queens. The area, home to many middle-class families, is famous for its abundance of immigrant communities and global cuisine.\"To Astoria: thank you for showing us the best of New York City,\" Mamdani's statement said.\"While I may no  longer live in Astoria, Astoria will always live inside me and the work I do,\" he said.During his campaign, Mamdani tied his core platform - freeze the rent – to his own housing situation. But his rivals, mainly former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, criticised Mamdani for occupying the apartment even though he came from a famous family. His mother is the filmmaker Mira Nair, and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.Not every mayor has chosen to live at Gracie Mansion.Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and founder of the eponymous financial terminals, chose to live in his own townhouse on the Upper East Side neighbourhood of Manhattan during his three terms, which ended in 2012.Instead, Bloomberg said he believed it should be a space for public city functions, and pushed for an extensive renovation of the aging mansion.When Mamdani moves into Gracie Mansion sometime around his inauguration on 1 January, he will find himself in surroundings very different than his modest Astoria digs.With its butter yellow paint, green shutters, and white railings, Gracie Mansion is a wedding cake of a house overlooking the East River. Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and his family.Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.",

    "body": "11 hours agoKatya AdlerBBC Europe editorUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has met key European allies as he faces US pressure to reach a swift peace deal with Russia.In London, Zelensky held talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.The meeting came amid US efforts to get Moscow and Kyiv to sign up - quickly - to a plan to end the war in Ukraine.For Kyiv, the crucial, thorny issues are the question of ceding territory to Russia as part of any peace deal and obtaining strong security guarantees to ensure that Moscow respects an eventual agreement.Ahead of the meeting in London, Starmer insisted - as he often has in the past - that Ukraine needed \"hard-edged security guarantees\". He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.In its National Security Strategy published on Friday, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services are common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLily Jamali,North America Technology Correspondent, San FransciscoandOsmond Chia,Business reporterUS President Donald Trump has announced that he will allow AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China.\"We will protect National Security, create American Jobs, and keep America's lead in AI,\" Trump said on social media on Monday.The decision will apply to other US chip companies like AMD and comes after extensive lobbying by Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, who visited Washington last week to drum up support.Nvidia - both the world's leading chip firm and most valuable company - has found itself at the centre of a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China in recent months, and had been banned from selling its most advanced chips to Beijing.Trump reversed the chip-selling ban in July, but demanded that Nvidia pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government.Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to stop buying Nvidia chips manufactured for use in the Chinese market. \"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" Nvidia said in a statement provided to BBC News.Nvidia's H200 is a generation behind its Blackwell chip, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor.Mr Huang told the BBC in September that the US needed \"to make sure that people can access this technology from all over the world, including China.\"He has also repeatedly warned that China, which has cultivated a chip production ecosystem of its own, was close behind the US in chip development.Nvidia hailed Trump's announcement on Monday.\"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,\" Nvidia said in its statement.The companies shares rose slightly on the news.Trump said \"$25% [sic] will be paid to the United States of America\" in his post.The BBC has reached out to the White House for clarification on the arrangement, which will likely face opposition from national security hawks in Congress.The sale of H200 chips to some Chinese customers \"buys time\" for the US to negotiate a deal with Beijing over rare earths and prevent major disruptions to global supply chains, Alex Capri from the National University of Singapore said.China holds a near-monopoly on the processing of rare earth minerals, which are essential for the production of most electronics.Although access to H200 chips is likely to benefit China's technology sector, Beijing is still expected to work towards reducing dependence on the US, Mr Capri said.Beijing had previously directed local tech firms to reject Nvidia's older H20 chips and encouraged them to buy domestically produced semiconductors, he noted.Researchers at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) said China's People's Liberation Army is using advanced chips designed by US companies to develop AI-enabled military capabilities.\"By making it easier for the Chinese to access these high-quality AI chips, you enable China to more easily use and deploy AI systems for military applications,\" said Cole McFaul, senior research analyst at CSET. \"They want to harness advanced chips for battlefield advantage.\"",

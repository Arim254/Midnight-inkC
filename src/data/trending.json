    "body": "Murder and MI5: How an extraordinary battle erupted over what the state keeps secret1 day agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent BBCListen to Daniel read this storyPaul Thompson was shot dead while being driven home in a taxi through Belfast in April 1994. He was murdered in a sectarian attack by loyalist paramilitaries who had set out to kill Catholics.The taxi driver was a friend who was collecting a fare at another address in the Springfield Park area in the west of the city. But no one at the address had rung the taxi firm. The call is suspected to have been a deliberate decoy by the killers who wanted to lure a taxi as prey. Paul was not specifically targeted. They could not have known he would ask for a lift or be in the area.One resident described hearing a heavy burst of gunfire after 23:00, running to the car and finding Paul.Members of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for the killing. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the group repeatedly murdered Catholic civilians like Paul.Family Handout/PA WireMembers of a banned loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association, using the cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters, claimed responsibility for killing Paul, who was nicknamed TopperOn the morning of the day that Paul was killed, locals had told police about a hole in a barrier – known as the 'Peace Line' – which separated the largely Catholic Springfield Park area from a largely Protestant neighbouring area. The residents were concerned the breach could give loyalist paramilitaries access to launch an attack.The hole was not fixed. After the murder, those responsible escaped through it.An inquest into Paul's death was opened in 1995 but never concluded. No-one has ever been held to account. There has never been a full investigation.Left by themselves to fight for answers, his mother Margaret and brother Eugene, both now dead, came to suspect collusion between British security forces and informants – meaning state agents - in the group responsible.In 2024, a coroner decided to release to the family a summary of secret information held by the police. This was said by the coroner to be of central relevance to the case and the police supported the move. But the British government and MI5 argued this would prejudice national security and mounted a legal challenge.PA MediaPaul Thompson was killed by the UDA, which used the cover name of the Ulster Freedom FightersThe case, which centred on who had the power to decide to release the information, reached the Supreme Court last summer, with Paul Thompson's brother, Eugene, tuning in to hearings from a hospice, as he neared death from cancer.The case is widely viewed as a major test of the state's policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCND) information involving national security.Who decides what is secret?The NCND policy is a position adopted by the government and security services when responding to questions about sensitive matters. It means there will be no confirmation, no denial, and no acknowledgement that the information requested is true, false, or even exists.Eugene Thompson's barrister, Monye Anyadike-Danes KC, said the family had concluded the murder happened because the authorities were colluding with the \"very group that actually perpetrated the killing\". She said Eugene was \"trying to find out why his younger brother was murdered\" and felt a \"deep responsibility\".PA MediaEugene Thompson, who has since died, spent years trying to find out the truth about his brother's deathEugene, she added, believed the public should be able to trust that those who kill will be held accountable, especially when they are agents of the state. She asked the judges not to let the NCND policy be used to \"conceal the involvement of state parties in the killing of an ordinary citizen\".Just before Christmas, the court ruled that the government's assessment of damage to national security \"should have been accepted by the coroner\" unless it was plainly irrational or there was no supporting evidence.The justices found the coroner had failed to understand it was \"solely\" for the government to make submissions on national security, not the chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Jon Boutcher, who had argued for the release of the summary of police files.PA WireJon Boutcher argued for the release of the summary of police filesPaul Thompson's case is part of a battle over the truth and whether it can be told. The battle concerns official secrets, often connected to state agents, and it pits bereaved families and senior police officers against the government and the security service, MI5.It raises a profound question: can the state, especially when it is implicated in killing, be trusted as the arbiter of what should remain secret?The spycatcher who was himself a spyOther cases in the coming months will force these issues further into the spotlight – and they come at a time when MI5's integrity is under significant scrutiny.Yet the Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case creates a precedent that says the government and MI5 can withhold information from bereaved families, for national security reasons, even when the police want it to be disclosed.Grainne Teggart, from Amnesty International, described it as a \"grim day for truth\" and part of a pattern of \"national security being used as a shield to cover up and conceal the state's role in very serious crimes such as murder and other serious human rights violations.\"The government, by contrast, welcomed the court's \"unanimous judgment\".\"This is a highly complex case with wide-ranging implications,\" it said. \"The government will therefore take time to fully consider all aspects of this judgment.\"The Supreme Court's ruling in the Thompson case has created a precedentDuring the Troubles, the state made widespread use of informants, otherwise known as agents, who were tasked with carrying out actions and often paid. Agents existed in the IRA and in loyalist paramilitary groups. They were run by the police, the army, and MI5.The former Met Police chief Lord Stevens, who led UK government-commissioned investigations into collusion in Northern Ireland between the 1980s and 2000s, once said that of 210 people arrested during his enquiries, only three were not state agents.Collusion occurred in a number of ways, he said, ranging from the state withholding intelligence and evidence from investigators, to state agents being involved in murder. In some cases agents told the authorities in advance about planned attacks but nothing was done to stop them.One of the most notorious agents was codenamed Stakeknife. It has been publicly known for more than 20 years that Stakeknife was a man called Freddie Scappaticci. He died under MI5 protection in 2023 having never been charged with any of the many murders and other crimes to which he is linked.Pacemaker Press/ PAFreddie Scappaticci, or Stakeknife, died under MI5 protection in 2023Scappaticci was a senior figure in the IRA's internal security unit, which was tasked by IRA leaders with identifying and killing British agents in the organisation. But, with the spycatcher himself a spy, the result was one British agent killing other agents, or people accused of being agents, and the state repeatedly not intervening to save them.Intelligence agencies and historic wrongdoingA long-running police investigation into Stakeknife, Operation Kenova, was forbidden from officially naming Scappaticci in its final report, published in December, despite the fact that his identity was widely known.The head of the Kenova team, Sir Iain Livingstone, pleaded with Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn for the right to name Scappaticci in his report, but Benn said he would decide after the Supreme Court ruling in the Paul Thompson case, which came later in December.That ruling has, in effect, strengthened Benn's power to stop him being named. If permission is granted, a revised version of the Kenova report can be published.Jon Boutcher, who was Livingstone's predecessor leading the Kenova investigation, has described the situation preventing Scappaticci being named as a \"pantomime\". It leads to the truth being \"suppressed,\" he argues, with \"profound and severe adverse impacts on victims and families, legitimate public discussion and debate, media freedom, open justice and public confidence in state agencies and the criminal justice system\".PA WireThe integrity of MI5, which is currently led by Sir Ken McCallum, is under scrutinyBoutcher, the PSNI chief constable, is involved in a significant and extraordinary stand-off with the government and MI5 over NCND.He has called for reform of the policy, a principle he fully supports but believes is being wrongly applied and has become a dogma that can be used to conceal wrongdoing.He has recommended the policy is reviewed to ensure it is applied proportionately and only where genuinely necessary for the protection of life or national security. The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"More from InDepthIn the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.Trust, state secrecy and the publicBoutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife. Scappaticci was engaged in a pretence to help shore up his reputation: publicly fighting a legal case, while hoping – and expecting – he would lose.VCG via Getty ImagesMany families of those killed or injured in the Troubles are still fighting through the courtsHowever, the government feared Scappaticci would win because a judge would assume he was not Stakeknife and force ministers to be honest.Jon Boutcher has now confirmed an extraordinary fact: the judge who heard the case did so after being secretly briefed on the real identity of Stakeknife.That judge, the then Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Lord Carswell, ultimately allowed the government to maintain NCND, creating the legal precedent on the policy.\"The full facts about this and the government's explanation will never be known while it is able to hide behind the shield of NCND,\" Boutcher has said.There is a second extraordinary fact: the government barrister who did the secret briefing was Philip Sales, who as Lord Sales was one of the Supreme Court justices in the Paul Thompson case. This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean BrownTwo further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months. The lead respondent in the case is Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was killed in 1997.PA WireMartina Dillon's husband Seamus was killed in 1997 by the paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF)The paramilitary Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) claimed responsibility. A coroner had opened an inquest on the basis there was evidence of collusion by state authorities, but the inquest was halted by the Legacy Act. No-one has ever been held accountable.The government has also registered an appeal in another key case.Sean Brown was also murdered in 1997 by members of the LVF. The 61-year-old father-of-six was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports club in County Londonderry. There were investigative failures by police and no-one has been brought to justice.PA MediaSean Brown, a father of six, was abducted as he locked the gates at a sports clubDecades later, a coroner issued a summary of secret material stating that \"a number of the individuals linked through intelligence to the murder were agents of the state.\" Sean's family want a public inquiry, and have won judgments over the past two years at the High Court and Court of Appeal. The government, which was found to have acted unlawfully by refusing a public inquiry, has registered an appeal to the Supreme Court on the basis the issue has constitutional significance regarding who should order inquiries.'The state viewed itself as above the law'At its heart, this vast battle over secrecy centres on two core claims by the state: that only the government and MI5 can ultimately be fully trusted on national security, and that their decisions on what information to release are solely about protecting the public.But these claims have been undermined by MI5's actions and omissions in several recent cases, all during the leadership of MI5's current director general, Sir Ken McCallum.A public inquiry into the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, which killed 22 people, concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held about the suicide bomber who carried out the attack. The inquiry chairman only uncovered what MI5 had done through his own persistent investigations during secret evidence sessions.The government has been resisting calls by families bereaved by the Manchester Arena attack for MI5 officers to be fully included in planned new legislation - known as the Hillsborough Law - that's designed to stop cover-ups and enforce truth-telling by public officials.Getty ImagesA public inquiry into the Manchester Arena bombing concluded that MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of key intelligence it heldAnother ongoing case is an example of how MI5's evidence cannot always be taken at face value: MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about having maintained its NCND secrecy policy in relation to an abusive neo-Nazi agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete. But MI5 had in fact told me the man was an agent when attempting to prevent me from investigating him. After MI5 apologised, we then showed that inquiries into what happened by MI5 and the government were deficient and unreliable, with further falsehoods provided to the court. This prompted the most senior judge in England and Wales to dismiss MI5's explanations and led the prime minister to order a new investigation, which will report this year.In the Stakeknife investigation, MI5 disclosed key documents years after enquiries began, aer Scappaticci had died and charging decisions had been made, and at a point when the Legacy Act banned police from investigating further. The new material revealed MI5 had greater and earlier knowledge of Stakeknife than detectives had previously been told, including that MI5 had been involved in tasking him. The lead detective said it was a \"significant failure on the part of MI5\". A review commissioned by MI5 found no deliberate wrongdoing.Cover-ups and failures to disclose information have a long history in Northern Ireland. Lord Stevens, recalling his investigations, has said: \"I was misled deliberately, I was criminally obstructed from doing my job by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and military, whilst MI5 failed to disclose information.\"Judge Pomerance, who was senior counsel on another major investigation, concluded bluntly: \"The state viewed itself as above the law\".The battle of bereaved familiesLast July, days before Eugene Thompson died, Jon Boutcher delivered a letter of apology on behalf of PSNI. He apologised for the police's failure to take action that may have prevented Paul Thompson's murder, and for failures in the investigation, including not properly pursuing suspects.Mark Thompson from Relatives for Justice (no relation of Paul and Eugene Thompson) says the apology was \"important\" but that Eugene was by this stage \"very ill\".Thompson familyJust before he died, Eugene Thompson (right) received an apology for police failings over the murder of his brother Paul (left). Their mother Margaret is also picturedMark had watched the Supreme Court hearings with Eugene on a laptop in his hospice and describes the experience as \"tough\". Eugene was \"praying and hoping that before he died the judgment could be made\", Mark says.Bereaved families caught up in these cases have had to battle for decades, trying to fill voids left by the lack of proper investigations by the state.\"You became an investigator, tracking down witnesses. You became an expert in the law in that field. And you fought your own case tooth and nail.\"Eugene Thompson became an \"accidental lawyer and expert in his own case\", he says, as he campaigned for answers about why his brother Paul was murdered.\"I think if we take anything from the legacy of him, it's the example of never giving up.\"Top image credit: PA MediaEmail: security.investigations@bbc.co.ukSignal: @investigation.56Click here to learn how to use SecureDrop, an anonymous whistleblowing tool that works only in the Tor browser and follow the advice to stay secure.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "3 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentReggae legend Sly Dunbar, who played with everyone from Bob Marley to The Rolling Stones, has died at the age of 73.One of the genre's most revered drummers, he played on tracks such as Bob Marley's Punky Reggae Party and Dave and Ansell Collins' classic, Double Barrel.However, he was better known as half of the production team Sly & Robbie - who produced groundbreaking hits for everyone from Peter Tosh and Black Uhuru, to non-reggae acts like Bob Dylan, Grace Jones and Ian Dury.Dunbar's death was first reported by his wife, Thelma, who told the Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner she had found him unresponsive on Monday morning. The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus & Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2001) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. \"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. \"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday... sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".",

    "body": "7 hours agoMaia DaviesYui Mok/PA WireFrost became emotional in the witness box and said it had been \"distressing\" to relive the eventsSadie Frost said the Daily Mail put a \"price on my head\" for stories as she told a court she had been \"violated\" by journalists allegedly hacking her voicemail for information.The actress became emotional as she gave evidence in her case against the paper's publisher - which includes a claim that a reporter learned about her terminated pregnancy through a private investigator.She told the High Court she knew \"100%\" that other stories had been obtained through hacking because they matched her voicemails \"word for word\". In a written statement, she said the alleged activity had made her believe she \"could not trust anyone\". Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) has denied all wrongdoing in relation to Frost and six other claimants, including Prince Harry. In court, Frost accused Mail reporters of bugging a call in 2002 to her then-husband, actor Jude Law, which revealed that their two-year-old daughter had swallowed part of an ecstasy tablet at a children's party. Frost broke down in tears as she recalled the press attention that followed.She had been \"mortified\" when she found out her landline had allegedly been listened to, she said in her statement, adding that it had brought \"suffering\" to her and her children.Frost and the other claimants have accused Associated Newspapers of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period.Her claim relates to 11 articles and two \"episodes\" of alleged unlawful information gathering for articles that were not published, including one about her pregnancy.David Sherborne, representing Frost, said she had discovered she was pregnant in 2003, which was unplanned and later terminated. He said she had only disclosed the termination to the father, Jackson Scott, and \"maybe\" a close friend.The barrister claimed Katie Nicholl, then the Mail on Sunday's showbiz editor, \"must\" have found out about the situation through unlawful information gathering. He added that her notes referred to a private investigator who had charged her £400.Antony White KC, for the publisher, said the payment was not linked to the pregnancy and that Nicholl had been told about the pregnancy by a freelance journalist with sources close to Frost.During cross-examination, Frost told the court: \"There was obviously a price on my head. The Daily Mail had said they were interested in Sadie Frost.\"When White suggested that members of Frost's family had provided information to the press and this would \"likely\" have encouraged her friends to do the same, Frost said she did not agree.Concluding her evidence, she said it had been \"demanding and very distressing having to relive what I didn't want to relive\".She said: \"For my children to see what I've been going through, it makes me sad - but they've been so supportive, and I've done it for them.\"Frost said in her written statement that was \"so angry\" the publisher \"thought it was okay to profit from someone going through so much pain without a thought for me or my children\".She said she did not know she had a potential claim against the publisher until 2019 and that ANL \"must be held accountable\".White argued that Frost's claims were \"wholly without any foundation in the evidence before the court\". He said the stories were sourced \"entirely legitimately\" and that her social circle was \"known to be 'leaky'\", with family members regularly giving information to the press.He said the claimants are \"clutching at straws\" and that the claims have been brought too late.Privacy cases must usually be brought within six years of the alleged breach, unless victims can show they could not bring a case at the time. The other claimants in the case against ANL are:Sir Elton John and his husband David FurnishActress Liz HurleySir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993They have accused ANL of \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for stories between 1993 and \"beyond\" 2018, including through private investigators and blagging.ANL has denied allegations of unlawful information gathering.The case continues and is expected to last nine weeks.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul Seddon,political reporter andKate Whannel,political reporterSuella Braverman says she is joining Reform as 'a better Britain is possible'Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman has accused the Conservatives of \"betrayal\" as she became the latest MP from the party to defect to Reform UK.She is the third sitting Tory MP to join Nigel Farage's party in the last eleven days, and takes Reform's tally of MPs to eight.At a press conference following her defection, Braverman said she had felt \"politically homeless for the best part of two years\" pointing to differences over areas including Brexit and immigration. Her defection comes hot on the heels of Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell, who also left the Conservatives earlier this month. Responding to her defection, the Conservative Party said it was \"always a matter of when, not if, Suella would defect\". \"There are some people who are MPs because they care about their communities and want to deliver a better country. There are others who do it for their personal ambition,\" the spokesman added.The party's initial statement also said: \"The Conservatives did all we could to look after Suella's mental health, but she was clearly very unhappy.\"They later issued a corrected statement which removed the sentence, saying the original lines were \"a draft version\" which had been \"sent out in error\".Braverman said the reference to her mental health was \"a bit pathetic\" and \"more signs of a bitter and desperate party that seems to be in free-fall\".The former Conservative MP Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg has said the party should sack whoever approved the press release remarking on her mental health.Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Sir Jacob said it was a \"dreadful and inexcusable thing to have said\".Responding to questions about when she decided to leave the Conservatives, Braverman compared the process to \"a divorce\".\"Gradually there is an erosion of trust and the breakdown of affiliation, love even, if you can call it that,\" she said.She accused the Conservatives of failing on Brexit while delivering \"out-of-control immigration\" and high taxes. She said \"the final straw came in the last few days\" as there appeared to be a \"concentrated effort, a witch hunt to hound out right-wingers\".She urged local Conservative activists in her constituency of Fareham and Waterlooville – who she acknowledged would feel \"upset and disappointed\" – to join her at Reform.Asked about suggestions that Reform was accepting too many former Conservatives, Farage said: \"We need the experience of people who were on the front line – that is the one commodity we are short of.\"A major figure on the right of the party under the last government, Braverman had long been seen as a potential Reform defector at Westminster. But her unveiling as Reform's latest recruit came as a surprise announcement by Farage during an event to launch a party group for military veterans in London.An MP since 2015, Braverman was attorney general under Boris Johnson and became home secretary under Liz Truss in September 2022.She was forced to step down from the role a month later, after it emerged she had sent an official document to a Tory colleague using her personal email.Rishi Sunak re-appointed her to the position just six days later upon entering Downing Street, but sacked her the following year, over an article accusing the Metropolitan Police of bias in the policing of pro-Palestinian protests in London. Farage said he had been talking to Braverman for \"just over a year\" about the possibility of defecting and that she had \"reached the view that actually the centre-right of British politics needs to unify around Reform\".He said her record as home secretary had been \"utterly useless\".\"They all were utterly useless because they were stuck within the ECHR [European Convention on Human Rights],\" he told reporters.\"The government was a failure but she's now prepared to put her hands up and say, 'we got it wrong'.\"The ECHR has been blamed by some politicians for making it harder to deport illegal migrants. The Labour government is in negotiations over how the treaty is interpreted.Braverman said the Conservatives' pledge to leave the convention altogether was \"a lie\".  In addition to the four sitting Conservative MPs who have now switched to Reform, around 20 former Tory MPs have made the move since the general election, including former ministers Nadhim Zahawi, Nadine Dorries and Jake Berry. Henry Smith - one of those ex-MPs to make the switch - said Braverman had tried to \"steer the last government in a Conservative direction\" but had been \"very much stopped in her tracks\". Speaking to Matt Chorley on BBC Radio 5 Live, the former Crawley MP said that while the Conservative leadership \"might be making noises to the right\", many Conservative MPs were \"quite frankly more comfortable in a much more Liberal Democrat position\".Appearing on the same programme, Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkin said: \"People like Suella and Rob Jenrick are leaving the Conservative Party just at the time when Kemi is sorting all these things out, and she's beginning to pull us up in the polls. \"Maybe it's because she's doing better that they're leaving.\"Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"Nigel Farage is stuffing his party full of the failed Tories responsible for the chaos and decline that held Britain back for 14 years.\"Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said \"Farage has recruited yet another Conservative minister with selective amnesia - one who complains about broken Britain while conveniently forgetting they helped break it.\" ",

    "body": "The government will announce a cap on ground rents paid by leaseholders in England and Wales on Tuesday morning, the BBC understands. Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent charges\".However, there had been suggestions the government could retreat from its claim due to concern about the potential impact on pension funds. The government has not yet confirmed where it will set the cap, but campaigners have said they believe £250 a year is likely. Earlier this month, former Housing Secretary Angela Rayner had urged the government to stick to its manifesto pledge on ground rents. There are around five million leasehold homes in England and Wales, where people own the right to occupy a property via lease for a limited number of years from a freeholder.Leaseholds is the default tenure for privately-owned flats, and the Land Registry estimates that 99% of flat sales in 2024 in England were leasehold. Ground rents were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remain for existing leasehold homes. The English Housing Survey has reported that in 2023/24, leasehold owner-occupiers reported paying a median annual ground rent of £120 a year. In 2024, when Labour were in opposition, the current Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook said his preference was for ground rents to be capped at effectively zero.Recent reports have suggested that the Treasury and the housing department have been at loggerheads over the issue, with concerns over how a cap would impact pension funds which own freeholds. Last week, former minister Justin Madders told the BBC that the prime minister could face a \"mass rebellion\" if the government abandoned its pledge on a ground rent cap.He said setting the limit at a peppercorn scenario would be his preferred choice but that he could accept a £250 cap due to the \"risk of elongated legal challenge\".A spokesperson for the Residential Freehold Association has previously said that capping ground rents \"would be an unprecedented and unjustified interference with existing property rights, which would seriously damage investor confidence in the UK housing market\".Harry Scoffin, founder of the Free Leaseholders campaign group, said: \"At the election, Labour promised to end the feudal leasehold system and if they backtrack on reducing ground rates to a peppercorn or zero financial value they're not ending the leasehold scam.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorWhile anyone drawing up a list of potential Conservative defectors to Reform UK would have put Suella Braverman near the top, this is still a big moment.Braverman is a former Conservative home secretary, a big beast of recent Tory history.And her switch emphasises the momentum Reform are showing in draining the Conservative Party.She is the fourth sitting Tory MP to join the party since the last election, and the third this month.The week before last it was Robert Jenrick, a week ago it was Andrew Rosindell, now Braverman.At just the point Kemi Badenoch has been attracting warmer reviews from her colleagues, another senior Conservative leaves the flock.On stage at her defection, Braverman shared Reform's diagnosis that Britain in broken, a label the Conservatives have shied away from using and disagree with.Like Jenrick before her, she offered a devastating critique on her former party's recent governing record.Again, like Jenrick, a government of which she was a part.She said she was \"calling time on Tory betrayal and lies\".I was also struck how emotional she was.I have known Braverman for more than 25 years – being a Conservative has always been part of her DNA.But as of today, no longer. Not a capital C conservative anyway. It is a huge personal moment for her.The question now for Nigel Farage is how he puts his growing team to good use and avoids fall outs.The question now for Badenoch is who on earth might run away next? Can the tide be stemmed?Some think there may be half a dozen or so more Conservative MPs who are weighing up making the leap themselves.Meanwhile, for Labour, after all the questions for them over the weekend about the machinations involving the prime minister and Andy Burnham, a chance to reflect on rows on the Right of politics.There is a controlling thought that unites both stories: the primacy of Farage in our national political conversation.Labour is squabbling over whether Burnham was their best bet to beat Reform in the forthcoming by election in Gorton and Denton, and whether him deserting the Greater Manchester mayorality would open up that role to Reform.Meanwhile, the Conservatives are considering, yet again, whether they face near oblivion.For both of Westminster's political mega brands, so many roads lead back to the rise of Reform UK.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesGoogle has agreed to pay $68m (£51m) to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly listened to people's private conversations through their phones.Users accused Google Assistant - a virtual assistant present on many Android devices - of recording private conversations after it was inadvertently triggered on their devices.They claimed the recordings were then shared with advertisers in order to send them targeted advertising.The BBC has contacted Google for comment. But in a filing seeking to settle the case, it denied wrongdoing and said it was seeking to avoid litigation.Google Assistant is designed to wait in standby mode until it hears a particular phrase - typically \"Hey Google\" - which activates it.The phone then records what it hears and sends the recording to Google's servers where it can be analysed.People use it for various reasons, ranging from simple questions about the weather to interacting with smart devices like lights and televisions. The firm says it does not send audio anywhere while it is in standby mode.But the lawsuit claimed Google Assistant would sometimes turn on by mistake - the phone thinking someone had said its activation phrase when they had not - and recorded conversations intended to be private.They alleged the recordings were then sent to advertisers for the purpose of creating targeted advertising.Class actionThe proposed settlement was filed on Friday in a California federal court, and requires approval by US District Judge Beth Labson Freeman.The claim has been brought as a class action lawsuit rather than an individual case - meaning if it is approved, the money will be paid out across many different claimants.Those eligible for a payout will have owned Google devices dating back to May 2016.But lawyers for the plaintiffs may ask for up to one-third of the settlement - amounting to about $22m in legal fees.It follows a similar case in January where Apple agreed to pay $95m to settle a case alleging some of its devices were listening to people through its voice-activated assistant Siri without their permission.The tech firm also denied any wrongdoing, as well as claims that it \"recorded, disclosed to third parties, or failed to delete, conversations recorded as the result of a Siri activation\" without consent.More from the BBC",

    "body": "A judge has told jurors to treat evidence from Donald Trump's youngest son with caution in a trial over an alleged attack on his friend.Barron Trump, 19, contacted UK police from the US after allegedly seeing his friend being \"beat up\" during a video call last year.On Monday, a judge told Snaresbrook Crown Court that his account could be \"mistaken or biased\" by his friendship with the woman and warned jurors not to rely on it as the main basis for a conviction.Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, is accused of assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice by pressuring the woman to withdraw her complaints.He denies all of the charges.Giving legal directions on Monday, Mr Justice Bennathan KC said Trump had not given evidence under oath or been cross-examined.\"If he had done so, no doubt he could have been asked about things such as whether he ever got a good view of what happened, whether he actually saw [the complainant] being assaulted, or jumped to this conclusion on the basis of her screams,\" the judge said.He added: \"He might also have been asked whether his perception was biased because he was close friends with [the complainant].\"The judge said hearsay evidence could be considered, but jurors should be \"careful\" as it had not been given under oath and should \"not convict the defendant mainly in reliance on it.\"Trump contacted the police on 18 January last year, shortly after he had a video call with the alleged victim.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.In an email sent to police in May, Trump said that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent,\" adding: \"As per evidence, I do not have any.\"The court was told police received no response to follow-up emails.Defending Rumiantsev, Sasha Wass KC described Trump as a \"wholly unreliable witness\" who was \"irrationally jealous\" of her client. She said the woman used her friendship with Trump, who she met on social media, as a \"ruse\" to provoke jealousy in what she described as a \"relationship full of dramas\".Prosecutor Serena Gates told the court to note Trump's \"urgent\" and \"worried\" tone in the call to police.Prosecutors allege Rumiantsev strangled the woman on the evening of 17 January 2025 after the pair had been drinking together. She later called the police, and Rumiantsev was arrested on the morning of 18 January and taken into custody.Rumiantsev, a Russian national who was living in east London at the time, told the court the pair had consensual sex, and that he had held her arms in self-defence to prevent her from hitting him.He said he was not sure why he answered the call from Trump, but that maybe he hoped \"that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else\".Earlier, Rumiantsev told the court that he had felt \"upset\" about her talking to Trump.But he said: \"I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages, I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else.\"The trial continues.",

    "body": "4 hours agoMerlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandShayan Sardarizadeh,BBC VerifyVerified videos emerging from Iran show bodies piled up in a hospital, snipers stationed on buildings and CCTV cameras being destroyed, following the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month.BBC Verify has been tracking the spread of protests across Iran since they first erupted in late December, but the near total internet blackout imposed by the authorities has made it extremely difficult to document the scale of the state's deadly crackdown on protesters.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of nearly 6,000 people, including 5,633 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December. It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is lent against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.Additional reporting BBC Persian.",

    "body": "8 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterRevel CollectiveThe owner of Revolucion de Cuba and Peach Pubs is to go into administration, putting as many as 2,200 jobs at risk.Revel Collective, the parent company which has 62 pubs and bars across the UK, put itself up for sale in October after facing what it called \"a continued period of external challenges\".The company said on Monday that discussions with a buyer are \"well advanced\" but it had filed to enter administration, with shareholders in the company to be left with nothing after the sale.Its pubs and bars, which also include the Revolution bar chain affectionately known as \"Revs\", will stay open through the process, but it has been suspended from trading on London's junior AIM stock exchange.Revel Collective, chaired by former Pizza Express boss Luke Johnson, said administrators will be appointed within 10 days.In a statement, it confirmed the deals being considered will wipe out shareholders and that it was entering administration to \"protect creditors\", such as banks.In December it said it had found \"a significant number\" of potential buyers, and was publicly linked with hospitality groups including bar and club owner Neos Hospitality.An announcement on a sale is expected in the coming days.When it put itself up for sale last autumn, Revel Collective blamed \"challenging economic conditions\" and decisions taken by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in Labour's first Budget after coming to power in 2024.That October, the chancellor increased national insurance contributions for employers and announced a rise in the minimum wage. Revel Collective also hit out at Labour's decision to increase duties on spirits, which it said will cost more than £4m each year across the group.A turnaround plan, which saw it shut 15 loss-making bars, was not enough to revive its fortunes, the company said.It is the latest high street firm to sound the alarm over higher taxes and staffing costs, with figures published on Monday revealing a surge in closures at the end of 2025.Data from consumer research firm NIQ showed that 382 hospitality firms shut up shop in the final three months of the year, more than four each day. The UK ended the year with 98,914 hospitality sites, it said.Karl Chessell, director of hospitality operators and food at NIQ, said \"relentless increases in operating costs\" are taking a severe toll on the sector.Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms have warned a crisis facing the sector will deepen when changes to how business rates are calculated come into effect in April.The chancellor is expected to water down the planned changes for pubs, which industry groups warned would see mass closures without a government rethink.She is facing pressure to go further and ensure any package of support benefits the whole hospitality sector, not only pubs.The Treasury has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe Beckham family has made its first joint public appearance since an Instagram post from Brooklyn Beckham confirmed a rift in the family.Last week, Brooklyn said in a statement he had no wish to reconcile with his family and accused his parents of attacking him and his wife in the press.On Monday, Sir David and Lady Beckham were joined by three of their four children - Romeo, Cruz and Harper - during an appearance at Haute Couture Fashion Week in Paris.The appearance came as Lady Beckham received a new accolade by becoming a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters.Posting on her Instagram after receiving her award, Lady Beckham said: \"I'm so honoured to be named a Chevalière de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. \"I have always deeply admired the French aesthetic and the seriousness with which it treats fashion: as a form of art. \"So to be recognised here and embraced in this way, is a profound privilege - one that reflects decades of commitment and dedication. My sincere thanks to the French Minister of Culture, Rachida Dati, for this honour. \"Thank you also to business partners who believed in me, my family, and especially David - my husband, and original investor. \"I couldn't be more grateful, you are my everything.\"The honour is awarded by the French Ministry of Culture, and recognises individual contributions of artists, writers, and cultural figures to the arts and literature.It has previously been given to actresses Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, director Denis Villeneuve and actor Jude Law, among others.Although this is the Beckhams' first appearance as a family since Brooklyn's Instagram statement, several of them have been pictured individually in recent days.Lady Beckham attended her bandmate Emma Bunton's 50th birthday over the weekend, while Sir David appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.Meanwhile, Romeo appeared at US designer Willy Chavarria's show in Paris, while Cruz announced a mini-tour with his band in the UK and Europe.In his Instagram post, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham said he does not want to \"reconcile\" with his family and accused his parents of \"attacking\" him and his wife Nicola Peltz Beckham in the press.Brooklyn, the Beckhams' eldest child, alleged his parents tried \"endlessly to ruin\" his relationship, and accused his mother Victoria of hijacking their first wedding dance.The Beckhams have not commented on the row, but Sir David, speaking generally about social media in Davos on Tuesday, said that children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

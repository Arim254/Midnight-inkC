    "body": "Haaland v Mbappe, dream ties and YMCA - the best of the World Cup drawImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, US President Donald Trump was on his feet dancing along to the Village People's rendition of YMCA at the end of the World Cup drawByBrendon MitchellBBC Sport journalistNext summer's World Cup, at long last, is starting to feel very real.But, while fans of the home nations can finally start marking their calendars and plotting routes through the tournament, Friday's draw in Washington DC was not short of other major talking points.Long before the Village People took to the stage to sing us out with a rendition of YMCA, we were left picking the bones out of a group stage which will see two of the world's best strikers go head-to-head and a knockout stage which could produce a truly mouthwatering meeting between two greats of the game.Are you excited yet?BBC Sport talks you through the best - and worst - of a World Cup draw which went on, and on, and on...The draw that seemed like it may never endMany people tuned into the BBC's coverage bang on 17:00 GMT, eager to find out who their teams would be playing in the group stage of next year's tournament.But, even though supporters should, by now, be well accustomed to these draws taking some time to get going... this was extraordinary.After performances by Robbie Williams and former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger, speeches from US President Donald Trump and Fifa counterpart Gianni Infantino, plus numerous montages, cutaways and interviews, it finally seemed to get going at 17:55 GMT. Or so we thought.Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Trump on stage to pick their respective countries, as co-hosts, out of the hat. But this was not new news.Cue more interviews and performances, before the actual draw eventually began at 18:27 GMT - nearly an hour and a half after the star-studded show first kicked off.The draw itself then took 59 minutes to complete, with BBC commentator Jonathan Pearce even quipping at one point that everything was taking so long to get through, the tournament would be upon us by the time the ceremony had been wrapped up.Media caption, Donald Trump receives inaugural Fifa Peace PrizeOn to the actual football...Next summer's World Cup will the biggest in the competition's history, with a record 48 teams taking part and a round of 32 being introduced for the first time.But this has perhaps led to the group stage - with 12 groups each containing four teams - being slightly diluted in quality.There are very few matches between the major nations. England's game against Croatia - a repeat of the 2018 semi-final - is the most significant on paper.That is the only group fixture which will see two teams ranked in the top 10 in the world come up against one another.Brazil (fifth) v Morocco (11th) in Group C is the next best. Netherlands have the toughest group in terms of Fifa world rankings, drawn against Japan, Tunisia and one of the play-off winners, while Germany - grouped with Ecuador, Ivory Coast and Curacao - have the weakest.But that doesn't mean there aren't still some interesting matches to look forward.Media caption, Tuchel reacts to England's 'difficult' World Cup groupTwo goal machines go head-to-headGenerational goalgetter Erling Haaland will get a crack at his first major tournament next summer.The Manchester City and Norway striker scored 16 times in eight World Cup qualifiers to drag his country to their first appearance in the competition since 1998.And 'drag' is no exaggeration - no player, across any continent, scored more in qualifying than Haaland. No wonder one Norwegian journalist went as far as suggesting \"there's already a case to be made that he's our greatest ever player\".Few have managed to even come close to the 25-year-old's ridiculous goalscoring feats in recent seasons - but someone who has is set to come up against him in the final round of group games.Along with Senegal and one of the play-off winners, Norway have been drawn against Kylian Mbappe's France in Group I.It means the top marksmen in the Premier League and La Liga will go head-to-head for the first time in international football.Mbappe, just two goals away from becoming France's record scorer at the age of 26, has scored 16 times in 15 league games this season for Real Madrid. Haaland, already Norway's record scorer and a whopping 22 goals clear of the next best, has scored 15 in 14 for City.\"It will be a great duel,\" France coach Didier Deschamps said.\"Kylian and Haaland are two players recognised around the world and they will be two of the contenders to be the top scorer.\"Expect goals. Lots of goals.We meet againMexico will take on South Africa at Estadio Azteca in the opening match of next summer's World Cup - and not for the first time.The two teams also opened the 2010 edition, which was hosted by South Africa - the first time the competition had been held in the continent.The game, which ended 1-1, is best remembered for Siphiwe Tshabalala's rasping second-half strike to put Bafana Bafana in front. It was an iconic World Cup goal.Another eye-catching group game will see France again come up against Senegal, who stunned the then-world champions in 2002 in one of the tournament's most famous shocks.On the opening night in Seoul, South Korea, future Fulham midfielder Papa Bouba Diop upstaged France's cast of star names to score the decisive first goal of the tournament after 30 minutes.France never recovered, failing to win any of their games and finishing bottom of the group.Dream ties for the debutantsUzbekistan, Cape Verde, Jordan and Curacao have all taken advantage of the expanded World Cup by qualifying for the finals for the first time.But standing in their way are former world champions, European champions and champions of South America.In Group E Curacao, the tiny Caribbean island who will become the smallest nation to play at a World Cup, will take on four-time World Cup winners Germany in their first-ever finals match.With a population of around 600,000, Cape Verde may well have been pinching themselves when they were drawn alongside European champions and World Cup winners Spain in Group H. They will take on the 2010 winners in their opening game.Jordan took part in qualifying for the first time 40 years ago and their reward for reaching their first World Cup is a tie with defending champions Argentina and Lionel Messi in Group J.And, in Group K, Italy's 2006 World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro will guide Uzbekistan into their first finals, where they will face Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal.What about the knockout stage?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Could Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi - pictured here before a friendly between Portugal and Argentina in 2014 - meet on the international stage again?Assuming all the top teams make it safely through their groups - a dangerous assumption, admittedly - we shouldn't have to wait too long for some of the big hitters to collide.It is in the last 16 where things could get really tasty, most notably with a potential tie between former champions Germany and France.The pair last met in a World Cup at the quarter-final stage in 2014, with Mats Hummels' early header enough to send the Germans through.If Germany come out on top again they would have to contend with the Netherlands and Spain if they are to reach the final - a very tough run having ended up in the most straightforward group.On the other side of the draw, eyes will instantly be drawn to the quarter-final stage, with old rivals Messi and Ronaldo set for a possible showdown.It would depend on both Argentina and Portugal finishing top of their respective groups and then squeezing through the last 32 and 16 but, if they are able to do that, it would be a remarkable way to mark the pair's final World Cups.If England get off to a great start against Croatia and go on to win their group, they would play a third-placed team in the last 32, although working out their exact opponents is somewhat complicated.If Scotland top their group Japan or Tunisia could be waiting for them in what would be their first-ever World Cup knockout game.

The groups were drawn from four pots, into which teams had been placed based on their position in Fifa's rankings.The top two teams in each group will qualify for the knockout stages, along with the eight best third-placed teams.England verdict: 'Difficult group, difficult opener'Media caption, Tuchel reacts to England's 'difficult' World Cup groupEngland head coach Tuchel oversaw a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign, his team winning all their eight matches without conceding a goal.Speaking to BBC Sport following the draw, the German said: \"Difficult group, difficult opener. Croatia and Ghana [are] two regulars in World Cups and two proud and strong nations. Panama I don't know much about at the moment, but we will before the tournament starts.\"For me, I've only experienced group football in Champions League formats and the way to approach it was to always give it the biggest respect and to put all the focus into winning the group. It always seems difficult, like our group now, but we are confident and we will be well prepared when we arrive.\"Croatia were the highest-ranked nation England could have drawn from pot two, and they are the side England lost out to in the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.In the group stage at that same tournament, England defeated Panama 6-1.\"Nobody should be underestimated. Of course Croatia is the standout nation but Ghana is always full of talent, can always surprise and has a big history in World Cup football,\" Tuchel said. \"Panama will try to make the most of their underdog role. No-one can be underestimated, everyone deserves the fullest respect.\"Media caption, How Croatia beat England in the 2018 World Cup semi-finalsScotland verdict: 'We'll bring a little bit of magic'Scotland stunned Denmark with two stoppage-time goals as they secured World Cup qualification in a dramatic winner-takes-all final group game last month.Nearly three decades after their most recent men's World Cup appearance, they will meet two of the nations they faced at France 98 in Brazil and Morocco, plus the lesser-known quantity of Haiti.Scotland boss Steve Clarke told BBC Sport: \"The draw is fantastic. One of the big things in my head was no European teams, so we're playing three top sides from three different continents of the world and that's what the World Cup is about.\"Looking ahead to facing record five-time champions Brazil, Clarke said: \"We are going to bring a little bit of magic as well, hopefully.\"It's great to play them. To go back to 1998, when Brazil and Morocco were in the group, that's a little bit of fate.\"Media caption, 'Bring it on' - Clarke releshing chance at World Cup after drawA World Cup of '104 Super Bowls'US President Donald Trump was awarded the new Fifa Peace Prize during a star-studded draw ceremony which lasted for more than two hours in Washington DC.Trump was presented with a trophy, medal and certificate by Fifa president Gianni Infantino and said the award, introduced to recognise an individual's actions for peace and unity, was \"one of the great honours of my life\".Fifa president Infantino described the 2026 World Cup for American viewers as equivalent to watching \"104 Super Bowls in one month\".The event was presented by comedian Kevin Hart, model Heidi Klum and actor Danny Ramirez, and featured live music performances by Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams, Nicole Scherzinger and Lauryn Hill.Former England and Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand conducted the draw, accompanied by American sporting greats Tom Brady, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal, and Canadian ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.Co-hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States had pre-determined group positions to ensure they will contest all group matches in their own countries.But Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum each drew their own nation's ball to begin proceedings.",

    "body": "4 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterA lifestyle app backed by Sarah Ferguson received more than £1m of taxpayers' money but collapsed without ever launching a product, according to documents filed this week.vVoosh was founded by Manuel Fernandez, a close friend of Ms Ferguson, who once described herself as an \"ambassador\" for the company and was an investor.It promised to give users \"the power to Find, Plan, Share, Live, and Remember all the things you love to do - and those you're yet to try.\"Ms Ferguson and Mr Fernandez did not respond to requests for comment.vVoosh was put into administration last month - and its failure will raise further questions about the judgement of the former duchess and the business relationships she pursued.Last month it emerged that a crypto-currency mining firm had agreed to pay her up to £1.4m for acting as a \"brand ambassador\" - that firm also failed, allegedly costing investors millions. Its co-founder denied misconduct and said he's working to repay backers. In September, a number of charities dropped her as a patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him. Manuel Fernandez, 57, went to school at Billericay in Essex, and was a soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held senior sales roles at a number of tech companies before founding vVoosh in 2010.He was regularly photographed with the then duchess in 2015 and 2016, and they attended Sir Bob Geldof's wedding together, but she denied rumours they were a couple, saying they were just \"good friends\".Over the years vVoosh raised approximately £9m, including more than £1m from the UK government through research and development tax credits, according to documents filed by the administrator.It paid teams in the UK and then India to work on the app, but never launched it, and so had no income to fund further development.Progress on the app stopped when the Indian contractor threatened legal action.The administrator's report describes a \"breakdown in communication between the current directors/major creditors and the founder [Mr Fernandez], who ceased communication following [his] resignation as a director earlier in the year\".The report says that the company is owed £324,609 by a former director. This is believed to be Mr Fernandez, who is the only director to leave the company since 2019.Last summer he sold his house in North London for £1.3m, according to Land Registry documents, and is believed to have left the UK.Meanwhile, vVoosh owes £50,000 to one of Ms Ferguson's companies, La Luna Investments, which also held just under 1% of the company's shares.Ms Ferguson, 66, lost her duchess title when her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, relinquished use of his Duke of York title over his links with Epstein. He has since been stripped of the title of prince as well. Documents show the firm had more than 60 other small shareholders - many with addresses in Essex and London, though a few American addresses also appear.The administrators said that there was \"significant uncertainty\" over how much money the company's creditors would get back once the company was wound up.One of the firm's American backers, Mark Guzy, has put more than £400,000 into the company to preserve \"certain essential services\" and protect the value of its software platform, which is the company's main remaining asset.vVoosh originally intended to share 10% of its profits with a charitable foundation.The BBC understands that the Charity Commission has now begun the process of removing vVoosh Charitable Foundation from the register of charities, on the basis that it does not operate.It is more than four-and-a-half years overdue with its reporting. Its last accounts, from 2019, show that it had £1.28m gross income, but spent only £18,240 on charitable activities.HMRC declined to respond to questions about the tax credits. Mr Guzy and the other directors of vVoosh declined to comment.Earlier this month Mr Fernandez denied taking money out of the firm, according to the Times.He told the newspaper that allegation would be \"disproven in the course of legal proceedings\".",

The BBC understands that Meghan tried to contact him earlier today, but it is not clear whether the attempt was successful. The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018.During the couple's engagement, the media interest in Thomas Markle and his family was intense. Mr Markle was found to have colluded with photographers who paid him for photos appearing to show the father of the bride preparing for the wedding.The fallout saw him pull out of his daughter's wedding just days before the ceremony in Windsor, citing health problems.King Charles III - who was then the Prince of Wales - walked Meghan down the aisle instead.It is not clear if Meghan ever resumed any proper relationship with her father following her marriage. Thomas Markle is not believed to have met Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.He was critical of his daughter and son-in-law's decision to step back from public duty in the UK and criticise the royal family. In one media interview he said: \"I think they're both turning into lost souls at this point.\"\"I don't know what they're looking for,\" he added. \"I don't think they know what they're looking for.\"",

The paper reports that the deal will \"transform the streaming giant into the dominant player in Hollywood\".The Mirror leads with next summer's World Cup tournament, which it calls \"One L of a draw\". England will begin their campaign against Croatia, before facing Ghana and Panama in Group L.The World Cup draw also splashes the Sun. The first match for \"unlucky Scotland\" will be against Haiti, followed by matches against Morocco and Brazil in Group C.Allies of the health secretary are urging Angela Rayner to sign up to a \"joint ticket\" for the Labour leadership, the Telegraph reports. Citing multiple Labour sources, the paper says MPs have urged Wes Streeting to promise Rayner a cabinet role and possible return as deputy prime minister if she agrees to the proposal. A spokesperson for Streeting denies the claims, calling them \"completely untrue\" and a \"silly season story\".The headline for the Times reads: \"Labour 'let women down'\". It quotes the former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Baroness Falkner, as saying the \"failure\" to publish guidance following a Supreme Court ruling on single-sex spaces reflected a government that has left women and transgender people in a \"grey zone\". The Independent leads with a compensation claim against 35 psychiatrists who worked at Huntercombe Group hospitals, filed by families and former patients after \"dozens\" of allegations of abuse.Dementia patients face a \"postcode lottery in diagnosis and care\", according to the Mail. The paper notes that dementia is still the UK's \"biggest killer\", and kills 76,000 Britons every year.Another Dulwich College student has made allegations of racial abuse against Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, according to the Guardian. Farage has repeatedly denied the claims, and told journalists that he had never been racist or antisemitic with \"malice\".The i paper reports on a \"record flu surge\" in the UK, with experts advising people to wear face masks if they are symptomatic. A \"nasty\" mutation has caused an early infection wave on wards and in care homes, it says.The Express cites experts as saying Britain's housing market will \"limp\" towards the end of the year after \"the paralysis caused by Rachel Reeves'  Budget\". The Star says US President Donald Trump has \"finally\" received a peace award, after he was announced as the inaugural recipient of a Fifa peace prize during the World Cup draw.

And we've had a blast. We've just had so much fun.\"The newspaper said they met in April 2016 when she appeared on Woman's Hour to read diary entries written during a bout of \"crippling insomnia\", which had forced her to pull out of a play at London's Royal Court.She said Thomas has been \"erroneously reported\" as being a sound engineer.While she did not expand on his exact role, she said: \"He was an actor originally. He's had an incredibly interesting life and really done it on his terms. He's a bit of a rebel, which I love,\" she said.Getty ImagesKim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker and Cynthia Nixon, pictured in 2000, starred in six series and two films of Sex and the City Sex and the City ran for six series from 1998 to 2004 and generated two spin-off films. It co-starred Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.Cattrall won a Golden Globe for her role in 2003, and received three other nominations for the show, along with five primetime Emmy nominations. Parker, Nixon and Davis appeared in spin-off series And Just Like That from 2021, while Cattrall just made a brief appearance in the final episode of season two in 2023.She reportedly did not play a greater part in the spin-off because of a strained relationship with the show and her cast-mates.Her other acting work includes the BBC's Bafta-nominated series The Witness for the Prosecution in 2016, the 2022 revival of Queer as Folk, 1987 film Mannequin and the original Police Academy film in 1984. Her stage work includes Sweet Bird of Youth in 2013 at London's Old Vic and Private Lives on Broadway in 2011.",

    "body": "A US judge has ordered the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the 2005 and 2007 investigation into convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Florida judge granted the justice department's request for the material following Congress' passage last month of a bill ordering the release of all files on the disgraced financier. The law \"applies to unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials\" that relate to Epstein and his accomplice-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, the court order said.A similar Department of Justice request was rejected in August because it violated a federal rule on grand jury materials, which the newly signed law overrides.US District Judge Rodney Smith granted the government's expedited motion to unseal the typically secret grand jury transcripts and modify a protective order that previously barred the release of the materials. In Friday's order, reviewed by the BBC, Judge Smith noted \"the later-enacted and specific language of the Act trumps prohibition on disclosure\".The justice department is also requesting the unsealing of documents in New York from Epstein's 2019 sex-trafficking case and Maxwell's 2021 sex-trafficking case.The documents relate to a case investigating whether Epstein abused underage girls. It ended without any federal charges being filed against the late financier. Epstein's struck a controversial non-prosecution agreement in 2008 and pleaded guilty to lesser state prostitution charges.Questions have swirled ever since about how Epstein was allowed to avoid federal sex-trafficking charges.US President Donald Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act into law last month after previously rejecting calls to release the files, which have dogged him during his second term in office. The law compels the justice department, FBI and federal prosecutors by 19 December to disclose the tranche of materials amassed during investigations into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August. On Wednesday, Maxwell's attorney filed a letter in Manhattan federal court asking to be released early. While the transparency law gives the justice department 30 days to release the files, it also allows it to withhold material related to an active criminal investigation, identify victims of Epstein's abuse or invade their privacy, or contain images of physical and child sex abuse, death, or injury.Material that could jeopardize an active federal investigation, is classified or that pertains to national defence or foreign policy is typically not made public, per justice department policy.Earlier this week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released images of Epstein's infamous island.The photos showed several bedrooms in the US Virgin Islands home, as well as a room with masks on a wall and a phone with names written on speed-dial buttons.",

    "body": "Top negotiators from the US and Ukraine said on Friday that they had constructive discussions on ending the Ukraine war, but the path toward peace depended on Russia.\"Real progress toward any agreement depends on Russia's readiness to show serious commitment to long-term peace, including steps toward de-escalation and cessation of killings,\" US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner said in a joint statement with Ukraine's negotiators.During the meeting, the two sides \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" and discussed deterrence. Talks in Moscow on Tuesday did not lead to a compromise on a possible peace deal in the near four-year war.The two-day meeting between Witkoff and Kushner and Ukraine's national security secretary, Rustem Umerov, and Brig Gen Andriy Hnatov was the sixth round of talks in two weeks. They will meet again in Florida on Saturday.In the statement the four said Ukraine's priority is \"securing a settlement that protects its independence and sovereignty, ensures the safety of Ukrainians, and provides a stable foundation for a prosperous democratic future\".They also discussed the US meeting earlier this week with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Ukraine's post-war future, which includes reconstruction of the battered country and economic initiatives with the US. Reaching a ceasefire and de-escalating tensions are needed to \"prevent renewed aggression and to enable Ukraine's comprehensive redevelopment plan, designed to make the nation stronger and more prosperous than before the war,\" they said.At least two major points of contention remain between Moscow and Kyiv - the fate of Ukrainian territory seized by Russian forces and security guarantees for Ukraine.Witkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday in negotiations that the Kremlin said produced \"no compromise\" on ending the war. Kushner, a businessman and real estate investor who advised Trump during the president's first term, was also in attendance.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen.On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said \"the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war\", but negotiations must be \"backed by pressure on Russia\".",

Even a decent score can land you in the bottom half of the leaderboard, and with so few couples remaining, there's everything to play for.And on Sunday night, two more couples will face the dreaded dance-off, with another set to be sent home.Strictly Come Dancing is on Saturday at 18:50 on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSarah TurnnidgeBristolNational HighwaysLogan Smith, 18, died after being hit by a car on the M5 in North Somerset on SundayAn 18-year-old who got out of an ambulance on a motorway was Tasered by police before he was hit by a car and died, the police watchdog has said.Logan Smith, from Weston-super-Mare, died on the M5 in North Somerset late on Sunday evening. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said he was being taken to hospital when concerned paramedics stopped the ambulance on the hard shoulder of the northbound carriageway of the M5. Police were called when Mr Smith walked onto the carriageway, and the officer was captured on bodycam footage discharging their Taser, causing him to fall to the ground where he was hit by a car. Mr Smith was given emergency first aid, but died at the scene. A post-mortem examination has since been carried out ahead of a future inquest.Investigators at the IOPC are now looking into the actions and decisions made by Avon and Somerset Police prior to Mr Smith's death. The watchdog's director Derrick Campbell said his thoughts were with Mr Smith's family and friends, as well as \"everyone affected by this shocking and tragic incident\".\"We want to reassure everyone that we will independently investigate all the circumstances surrounding this incident, including the use of a Taser,\" he added, explaining that initial accounts had been taken from the officer and ambulance staff involved.He said the IOPC met with Mr Smith's family on Tuesday to give their condolences and explain the investigation, including the matter of the Taser being discharged. In a statement given after the incident, Avon and Somerset Police Assistant Chief Constable Joanne Hall said: \"This incident has had a significant effect on our officers and ambulance crews who are understandably incredibly upset by what happened.\"As well as providing support to the man's family, we are also making sure that the appropriate welfare arrangements are in place for our staff and also for those members of the public who were either directly involved or who witnessed the incident.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

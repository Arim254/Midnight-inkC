Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "4 hours agoBBCThe Observer headline declares \"Blackmail over Greenland\" after US President Donald Trump announced \"rising tariffs on the UK and European allies until he gets control of the Danish territory\". A striking image of red-and-white Greenland flags waved by protesters in front of snow-capped hills dominates the front page. \"Greenland is not for sale!\" read several of their posters.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anger at Trump's tariffs leads the Sunday Times. Trump \"blindsided his Nato allies\" with the move, it says. Meanwhile, Sir Keir's aide Darren Jones has been accused of launching a \"briefing war\" against Health Secretary Wes Streeting.For the Sunday Telegraph, Trump's actions amount to a \"trade war\". The paper highlights the PM's comments that the tariffs are \"completely wrong\", and that is backed in an editorial column by former US national security adviser John Bolton, who declares: \"This is the worst move of his presidency.\" Separately, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch tells the paper the Conservatives are the only party that will stop Britain becoming a \"poodle\" state.The Greenland tariffs also lead the Independent website. Trump has said the 10% trade fees will remain in place unless a deal is reached to sell the Danish territory to the US by the start of February, the paper reports. A photo of protesters waving Greenland flags in Copenhagen takes up much of the front page.The Mail on Sunday has gotten hold of a \"secret defection memo\" that it says fell into the hands of Tory leader Kemi Badenoch before Robert Jenrick's move to Reform. The memo is alleged to recommend Jenrick style himself as the \"new sheriff in town\", which the Mail dubs \"a bizarre plot\". In a royal exclusive, the Mail says Princess Eugenie has cut Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor out of her life.Following Jenrick's defection, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage tells the Sunday Express it's time for the right to unite behind his party. \"They want to fiddle with the plumbing and we think it needs a brand new boiler,\"  Farage said of the differences between the Tories and Reform.\"I will be free\" writes the Daily Star, as it says killer nurse Lucy Letby has told \"fellow lags and prison staff\" her convictions will be \"quashed within months\". Letby is currently serving 15 whole-life terms after she was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims.A photo of the Duke of Sussex next to King Charles leads the Sunday Mirror as they describe \"Harry's lonely trip home\". While \"both are in London\", the pair will not see each other this week.The Sunday People reports Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has undergone a \"brain scan after fall\". Her \"hospital shock\" comes \"just days before tour\".A TV row gives the Sun on Sunday its front page lead. It reports \"fury at anti-Muslim posts\" that have been discovered in the social media feed of a contestant on the upcoming series of BBC One's The Apprentice is caught in a \"race rant storm\". Contestant Levi Hague has apologised for making comments containing \"truly awful language\" in posts written more than a decade ago. The series is produced by an independent production company and the BBC said in a statement it had asked the company for \"further assurances on their social media checks given the process has not been completed to a satisfactory standard in this instance\".Related Internet Links",

It has now been deleted.The video, which was shared on Instagram and X on Friday, opened with a close-up image of feet suspended in the air, before showing the duo pegged to a washing line.Former X Factor contestant and mental health advocate Katie Waissel described the video as \"triggering, insensitive and frankly reckless to push out as 'entertainment'\".\"This opening visual of feet suspended above the ground is not a harmless 'play on words',\" she wrote, adding: \"The suicide imagery is impossible to ignore.\"Other social media users called the clip \"insensitive\", \"triggering\" and in \"poor taste\". Ant and Dec said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"taken on board comments\" and deleted the video.The podcast will see the duo catch up about their lives as well as taking questions and comments from listeners.It is part of their new Belta Box brand, which will be on platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, and will also host classic clips from their TV careers as well as \"new digital formats\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, information and support can be found at the BBC's Action Line.",

    "body": "US forces have carried out a strike which killed an al-Qaeda leader \"who had direct ties\" to an Islamic State (IS) group terrorist responsible for an ambush which killed three Americans in Syria, officials have said. The US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement that Bilal Hasan al-Jasim was killed in the attack on Friday, which took place in northwest Syria. The statement says he was \"directly connected\" with the IS group gunman who killed and injured American and Syrian personnel. The BBC has not independently verified the US claims.\"The death of a terrorist operative linked the death of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,\" said Centcom commander Adm Brad Cooper.\"There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you.\"The US has been carrying out large-scale strikes on IS targets in Syria, dubbed Operation Hawkeye Strike, since the deaths of the three American on 13 December 2025 in Palmyra, central Syria.So far, the US has hit more than 100 \"infrastructure and weapons site targets\", using 200 precision munitions, according to Centcom.Earlier this month, Centcom said it had killed or captured nearly 25 IS group members in 11 missions between 20 December and 29 December.Syria has been in a fragile state since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad's regime in December 2024, which effectively ended a civil war that had ravaged the country for 13 years.Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known by his nom-de-guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been serving as the country's president since his rebel group ousted Assad and solidified control.IS has been weakened in Syria, but still remains active, predominantly carrying out attacks against Kurdish-led forces in the north-east in 2025.",

He also gave a series of talks about the images at events run by retirement living provider Pegasus Homes, which sponsored his work. It comes after an earlier calendar he produced in 2021 collected £10,000 for the hospice. Steph Peters, the hospice's head of marketing and communications, said Laybourne's commitment to help the facility was \"truly extraordinary\".Phil LaybourneThis red stag is also included in the calendar for September \"We are enormously grateful to Phil and everyone involved, whose support helps ensure that compassionate hospice care continues to be available to local families when they need it most,\" she said.\"We look forward to our continuing partnership and to seeing what his next project will bring.\"Steve Bangs, chief executive of Pegasus Homes, said: \"We're so incredibly proud of Phil's fantastic achievement in creating this wonderful calendar and using his passion for photography to raise such a significant amount of money for a cause close to his heart.Laybourne, from Wooburn Green in Buckinghamshire, said he wanted to bring in \"much-needed funds for an incredible organisation\".Thames HospiceLaybourne (third from left) handed over the £13,300 to the hospice following another fundraising projectRelated internet linksMore from the BBC",

    "body": "8 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "A US federal judge has issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.Judge Katherine Menendez ruled on Friday night that federal agents can't arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators, including those monitoring and observing ICE agents. The ruling comes ahead of planned weekend protests against the widespread immigration action in the city and follows the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent earlier this month.The US Department of Homeland Security said it is taking measures to protect officers from rioters.On Friday, Minnesota officials urged protesters expected to take to the streets this weekend to stay orderly and peaceful.The state's National Guard has been placed on alert and other law enforcement officers have been deployed ahead of both expected anti-ICE demonstrations and a counter march being planned by a conservative influencer.Judge Menendez's 83-page order bars federal agents from arresting and \"using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity\".The ruling, which stems from a lawsuit filed by a group of protesters in December, also limits agents from \"stopping or detaining drivers and passengers in vehicles where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering\" with their work. \"The act of safely following [immigration agents] at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop,\" it says. In a statement to CBS, the BBC's US partner, in response to the order, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency \"is taking appropriate and constitutional measures to uphold the rule of law and protect our officers and the public from dangerous rioters\".The White House also criticised the ruling.\"This absurd ruling embraces a dishonest, left-wing narrative,\" spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Politico. \"Here's the truth: federal agents have acted lawfully to protect themselves and ensure the integrity of their operations when individuals attempt to intervene.\"Minneapolis has been on edge since Good's 7 January shooting, with protests across the city. There have been some reported clashes between protesters and federal officers over the past week.On Saturday, the Minnesota National Guard posted on X that troops \"are on standby, ready to assist local law enforcement and public safety agencies.\" The post added that National Guard troops will wear high-visibility yellow vests \"to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms\".Additionally on Friday, the justice department  announced it was investigating two of the state's leading Democrats - Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - over alleged attempts to impede federal immigration operations.Both have condemned the ICE operations in the city.\"A reminder to all those in Minnesota:  No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in an online statement.The investigation was criticised by Walz and Frey. \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic,\" Walz said in a statement.",

    "body": "16 hours agoAmy WalkerAndrea BradyJessica Brady contacted her GP practice more than 20 times feeling unwellA new system urging doctors to \"think again\" if they are unable to pin down a diagnosis after seeing a patient three times - named Jess's Rule - is to be advertised in every GP surgery in England from next week. The NHS initiative is named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced stage four cancer in 2020 aged 27.Before her eventual diagnosis, Jess had contacted her GP on more than 20 occasions after feeling unwell, but was told her symptoms were related to long Covid and that she was \"too young for cancer\".Her mother, Andrea Brady, welcomed the government rollout of the posters. She told BBC Breakfast: \"We still need to trust our doctors but trust ourselves as well.\"Under the patient safety initiative, GPs are asked to take a \"fresh eyes\" approach if they have been unable to offer a patient a substantiated diagnosis or their symptoms have escalated after three appointments.Jess, an engineer at Airbus, became ill in June 2020. Andrea said her family initially assumed it was something minor, \"but that wasn't what happened for Jess\".Her symptoms, which included unexplained weight loss, night sweats and vomiting, then worsened. \"It was very, very painful... to see the impact on Jess not just physically but the toll it was taking on her mentally,\" said Andrea.Jess had contact with six different doctors at her GP surgery and three face-to-face consultations with a family doctor, but no referral to a specialist was made.Her family then arranged a private appointment and she was referred to a specialist,   who gave Jess a terminal cancer diagnosis of adenocarcinoma - cancer of the glands that line the organs - in November.She died three weeks later, just days before Christmas 2020.Andrea said her daughter was \"trying to be really resilient and advocate for herself\" before her diagnosisThe government said the consultation room posters would improve patient safety by prompting doctors to \"revisit patient records, challenge initial assumptions and remain alert to warning signs that might otherwise be missed\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Every patient deserves to be heard, and every serious illness deserves to be caught early. \"Jess's Rule makes that possible - reminding clinicians to take a fresh look when symptoms persist, and empowering patients to speak up about their care.\"Andrea said the family wanted to follow what Jess had \"really wanted to start when she was diagnosed, which was to create some positive change\".\"It's taken five years but to know now that Jess's rule is out there and happening and is being received really positively and proactively by primary care colleagues is really, really important,\" she added.She said the rule was a \"two-way thing\" intended to benefit both patients and GPs.The posters were designed by Jess's parents Andrea and Simon in partnership with NHS England and the Department of Health, and funded by the Jessica Brady Cedar Trust established in her honour.Dr Claire Fuller, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"Encouraging GP teams to challenge a diagnosis when it matters most could save lives by avoiding missed or late diagnoses.\"",

When the pub closed, the brothers opened Hiks together out of the same building in 2010, and a year later Ouday branched out by opening his own fish and chip shop in Neath.Leanne JonesOuday Hikary opened his business in Neath back in 2011He went on to win the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Awards in 2016.\"He's my brother and I'm so proud of what he has achieved and if he does really well I'll be the first one to cheer him and be his biggest fan,\" Emir, who has five children,  told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, to which Ouday responded: \"I'm so proud of you.\"Leanne JonesOuday and Emir Hikary's businesses have both been named in the top 50 UK takeawaysRunning the business is a family affair for father-of-four Ouday, with his wife Kasia doing admin for the business and three of his children also helping out.He said he loved running his fish and chip shop as \"every day is different\" and he enjoyed the banter with the customers and being part of the community.Ouday said it was good to have won the award during what was a challenging time to run such a business, with the high cost of fish, coupled with factors such as the cost of living crisis.Emir said: \"We haven't had things handed on a plate to us. \"We worked together when we first started off and we have to work really hard.\"He said he was \"very happy\" that he and his brother had won the awards adding they were proud of their staff for the key role they played in the win.Leanne JonesHikary's Fish Bar in Neath has won a number of awardsThe brothers will receive a plaque which they plan to put in pride of place above the range in their respective shops.Emir said they wanted to thank fellow fish and chip shop owners at the Roma Fish Bar in Gorseinon, Swansea, saying they had supported them right from the beginning and \"they have always been there for us\".Both businesses have been previous winners in the top 50 UK takeaways awards, with Hiks also reaching the finals of the Wales category of the National Fish and Chip Shop Awards in 2020.More top stories",

    "body": "British qualifier Arthur Fery claimed another notable Grand Slam scalp by beating Italian 20th seed Flavio Cobolli to cause the first shock on day one of the Australian Open.World number 185 Fery matched the biggest win of his career with a 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 6-1 victory at a sun-soaked Melbourne Park.The 23-year-old, making his main draw debut at an overseas Grand Slam, beat 20th seed Alexei Popyrin at Wimbledon last year.Cobolli was struggling physically from the start with a stomach issue, running off court at the end of the opening set for a toilet break.\"It seems I like drawing 20th seeds at Grand Slams,\" Fery joked afterwards.\"I love playing on big courts and big stages.\"Cobolli took electrolyte tablets provided by the doctor after going off court, then asked to see the medical staff again after going 3-0 down in the third set.Nevertheless, Fery deserves huge credit for the way he approached the situation against Wimbledon quarter-finalist Cobolli.The Londoner, who grew up close to the All England Club in Wimbledon, played smartly and aggressively, moving Cobolli around the court.The 5ft 9in Fery lacks the punch of some opponents on serve, but illustrated there is plenty of venom in his groundstrokes as he fired forehands past his opponent. A desolate-looking Cobolli continued to struggle physically, with a series of double faults helping Fery to a 5-1 lead in the third set.Fery then had no issue serving out for the second Grand Slam victory - and only the third tour-level win - of his career.He will face Argentina's Tomas Martin Etcheverry - a top-30 player who came through in five sets to beat Miomir Kecmanovic - in the second round.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDan WhitworthMoney Box reporter, LondonBeth KojderBeth Kojder became pregnant and gave birth to her baby while still waiting for British Gas to provide an accurate final billA woman says it is \"absurd\" it took British Gas 15 months to produce a final bill and refund more than £1,500 of credit, despite the energy ombudsman telling the firm to do so nearly one year ago.Beth Kojder moved out of her one-bed flat in south-east London in October 2024 but complained to the ombudsman a few months later when the company did not send her a final bill or refund her credit.In February 2025 the ombudsman decided in Beth's favour and told British Gas to carry out her request. But it has no legal powers to force it.Beth only received the offer of her money this week, just days before her case was due to be heard in a small claims court.British Gas said it was \"implementing the ombudsman's remedy\" for Beth, adding it was \"very sorry\" for how long it had taken.Beth told the BBC the process had been \"relentless and it's tiring and it's completely draining\".When she moved out of her flat, she asked British Gas for a final bill using the meter readings she provided. She also asked it to refund her £1,700 less a few hundred pounds she expected to owe for her final bill.\"It's a significant amount of money. Maybe not to British Gas but it is to me,\" said Beth, who had her first baby in December. \"That's almost £2,000 I could have done with. Then there's all the admin.\"Not legally enforceableWhen she didn't receive her final bill or refund she complained to British Gas.But Beth said she \"got nowhere\" so took her complaint to the energy ombudsman.It is an independent, impartial dispute resolution scheme that energy customers can complain to eight weeks after first complaining to their supplier.Energy suppliers are legally obliged as part of their licence conditions to be a member of an independent customer dispute scheme. But the energy ombudsman is not a statutory body and it cannot legally force suppliers to act.In 2024, there were 93,000 complaints accepted by the energy ombudsman with around 70% of those cases ruled in favour of consumers, with suppliers required to take action within 28 days.In the vast majority of cases, suppliers met that deadline, but in many thousands of cases the deadline was either missed or no action was taken at all.It has prompted the Department for Energy to look at ways to strengthen the energy ombudsman saying the number of decisions not being implemented quickly enough was too high.Beth KojderBeth's energy bill was for her small, one-bed flat in south east LondonIn Beth's case the ombudsman issued four resolutions in February 2025. British Gas actioned three minor ones including a written apology and a goodwill credit of £100 for shortfalls in service.But the decision also required British Gas to \"complete the final billing of the account... based on the [meter] readings already provided by Beth.\" But 11 months on and that still hadn't happened.Beth said the only option she had left was to go down a legal route via a small claims court.\"I just felt completely desperate and like it was the only option to try to get some traction,\" she said.Beth KojderBeth said it was frustrating how much intervention she, as a consumer, had to do to resolve the matterBBC Radio 4's Money Box first contacted British Gas about this case in early December and, up until late Thursday night, Beth was resigned to having to go to the small claims court to get what she strongly feels she's owed.Then, British Gas came back with an offer of everything Beth was asking for, which she has happily accepted.Beth said she was pleased to get the matter resolved but said she was frustrated that it had taken so many months to do so and felt British Gas had \"completely failed\" to engage with the ombudsman process.\"I still think the fact it's taken this long to reach [a resolution] is absurd. And the level of intervention that's been required on my part as a consumer is unbelievable.\"British Gas said: \"We're implementing the Ombudsman's remedy and, together with Ms Kojder, are finalising a resolution to her claim. We appreciate this has been difficult for her and we're very sorry for the length of time it has taken to put things right.\"Ofgem's deputy director of retail compliance, Jackie Gehrmann, told the BBC that in the last year suppliers have paid out £27m in fines and voluntary payment agreements in consumer related issues.\"The message to suppliers is really, really clear. When the ombudsman makes a ruling they should implement that ruling as quickly as possible,\" she said.The DESNZ told the BBC: \"We are strengthening the Energy Ombudsman so consumers can be confident that when it has ruled in their favour, action will be taken.\"",

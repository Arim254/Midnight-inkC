Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "6 hours agoPAAnya Taylor-Joy and her husband were staying in a London mansion at the time of the break inAn armed robber who tried to prise open the bedroom door of Hollywood actress Anya Taylor-Joy while she was staying at a London mansion has been jailed.Kirk Holdrick, 43, was one of two masked men who smashed their way into the luxury property, in what may have been a targeted raid, Wood Green Crown Court heard.In November, Holdrick was jailed for 12 years for a home invasion in Dorset where a  mother and daughter were tied up and threatened with violence. He was handed a further three-year custodial sentence after admitting burglary of the London home.Holdrick, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, was described in court as a career criminal with convictions dating back to his teenage years.Taylor-Joy and her husband, Malcolm McRae, were staying at the London property on 12 February 2023 when they heard the glass of a side window being smashed.McRae confronted the intruders before barricading himself and his wife inside a bedroom, which they then tried to prise into. Armed only with a lamp, he managed to scare off the men by bluffing that he had a gun, causing them to flee the scene empty-handed.Prosecutors suggested that because the burglars did not simply steal expensive items and implied they had intended to target the celebrities personally.The couple told police they had been traumatised by the ordeal and feared being targeted again.The Golden Globe winner known for The Queen's Gambit, the Dune films and Peaky Blinders, appeared on the Baftas red carpet just a week after the ordeal.Holdrick was arrested on 18 April 2023 after stepping off a ferry from Belfast to Liverpool. He claimed he had been to the property previously as a guest at a party and suggested that was how his DNA had been left behind. He later abandoned this defence and pleaded guilty to burglary in mid-December last year.PA MediaHoldrick, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, was described at Wood Green Crown Court as a career criminalNine days after the break-in at the London mansion, Holdrick took part in a second home invasion in which a mother and daughter were held at gunpoint, tied up and threatened with violence.Holdrick and his accomplice, Ashley Fulton, disguised themselves as police officers during the break-in at a property in Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour, Dorset where they targeted the home of wealthy businessman Mark Aitchison.Aitchison's wife, Kerry, was told she would be killed if she did not open the family safe. When their daughter Emily arrived home unexpectedly, she was also restrained and threatened.The intruders told her they would shoot her in front of her mother and demanded to know where the iron was, saying: \"We want to burn you.\"The pair escaped with £200,000 worth of luxury watches, designer handbags, jewellery and cash, but left a trail of DNA behind. Police traced the getaway car and recovered vapes from the vehicle.Holdrick, who previously briefly dated one of the cast members from The Only Way Is Essex, was jailed for life in 2005 for armed robberies on a security van.He was recalled to prison to continue serving his life sentence after his latest offences.In November, he was jailed for 12 years for the Sandbanks robbery and a further four years on licence if he is released, after pleading guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court to two counts of robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and fraud.Related to this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "34 minutes agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterGetty Images for DisneyWalt Disney has named Josh D'Amaro, the head of its amusement park business, as its new chief executive.D'Amaro, a 28-year veteran of the company, will replace current boss Bob Iger. He is due to start in the new role on 18 March.In selecting D'Amaro, Disney has turned to the leader of the part of its business that has delivered the most reliable profits in recent years, as the company works to find its way in the world of streaming. The decision ends a succession puzzle for the entertainment giant, which Iger has led for roughly two decades, except for a brief interlude that ended in 2022 when the board ousted his successor and asked Iger to return.Iger quickly set about restructuring the firm, aiming to tackle ballooning expenses in the streaming, television and film business, regain momentum for sports-focused ESPN and expand its parks and cruise lines.  In the announcement, Iger said he was \"proud to step away at a moment when Disney's future has never been brighter\".D'Amaro joined the company in 1998 at Disneyland Resort, before rising to his current position as chairman of the Disney Experiences division, which has 185,000 employees and generated $36bn in revenue last year.In the role, the 54-year-old oversees 12 theme parks and 54 resorts globally. He has handled projects such as World of Frozen and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, as well as managing digital ventures such as Disney's collaboration with the firm behind Fortnite. In an interview on CNBC, Disney board chair James Gorman said D'Amaro brought not just financial skills but \"great creative touch\".As chief executive, D'Amaro will be taking on the top role at a moment when media companies in the US are facing increased political pressure. Disney itself has been a prime target, blasted in recent years by Republicans such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for promoting \"woke\" values. The company most recently drew headlines when it temporarily suspended comedian Jimmy Kimmel, a decision linked to comments over the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.Disney's parks business in the US has also drawn attention for rising costs faced by visitors, while investors have been frustrated with its share price, which has lagged that of other publicly listed firms. Shares dipped 1% in early trading after the announcement. Disney also named Dana Walden, currently co-chair of its entertainment business, to a new role as chief creative officer, reporting to D'Amaro.  Walden, who is known outside of work for her friendship with former Vice President Kamala Harris, had been seen as D'Amaro's chief rival for the top job.Disney is trying to avoid a repeat of 2020's botched hand-off. That year, it also elevated the successful head of the theme parks business, Bob Chapek, to chief executive. But within weeks, the Covid-19 pandemic had forced the company to shut its doors. His tenure was marked by strains on the content side of the business, which saw costs rise, as well as the brand's involvement in several high-profile public clashes, including with actress Scarlett Johansson.Analyst Paolo Pescatore warned that, despite the profits delivered by parks, the key to Disney's success lies in its content.\"Disney can ill afford another messy handover,\" he said. \"While it is a strong endorsement of D'Amaro's abilities to elevate Experiences to the fore.... he should not lose sight of Disney's core capabilities.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoMaia DaviesReuters/Getty ImagesThe apparent resemblance was first reported on the front page of a national Italian newspaper on SaturdayChurch and government officials in Italy have launched an investigation into claims that the face of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was painted on an angel during the restoration of a fresco in Rome.Italy's culture ministry has sent officers to inspect the artwork in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina, while the Diocese of Rome expressed its \"disappointment\" and said it would determine who had been responsible.The artist, Bruno Valentinetti, said he had simply restored the fresco he painted in 2000 and denied modelling the angel after the prime minister.Meloni responded in a post on Instagram saying she was \"definitely not like an angel\", accompanied by a laughing emoji.The apparent likeness was first reported on Saturday by Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which ran before-and-after pictures of the fresco and claimed the angel holding a map of Italy had previously looked like a \"generic cherub\".The parish priest said the paintings had simply been touched up following recent water damage - but said he did not \"understand the fuss\" in any case.\"Painters used to put all sorts of things in frescoes,\" Monsignor Daniele Micheletti said.Valentinetti, 83, denied the claims. \"The restored face is the one that was painted 25 years ago,\" he said, in remarks reported by news agency AGI.\"Who says it resembles Meloni?\"Opposition parties were quick to urge an investigation. Irene Manzi of the Democratic Party called the situation \"unacceptable\" while the Five Star Movement said art must not become \"a tool for propaganda\", whether or not it depicted Meloni.Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli ordered \"technical officials\" to inspect the painting \"to ascertain the nature of the intervention\" and determine next steps.The Diocese of Rome, meanwhile, said it knew about the restoration but that it had been told nothing would be added or changed.\"The modification of the cherub's face was the decorator's initiative, not communicated to the competent authorities,\" it said in a statement shared by news agency Ansa.It later said the Cardinal Baldo Reina - the Pope's Vicar for the Diocese of Rome - would immediately investigate \"to determine the possible responsibilities of those involved\".It said the cardinal \"distances himself from Monsignor Micheletti's statements and expresses his disappointment over what happened\" and stated its \"commitment to the protection of its artistic and spiritual heritage\" against misuse or exploitation.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAlicia CurryWorld Governments SummitPrince Edward in DubaiThe Duke of Edinburgh has said it is \"really important\" to remember Jeffrey Epstein's victims as his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, faces growing pressure to give evidence over what he knows about the late sex offender.Prince Edward's comments are the first from a senior royal since Andrew was pictured in the latest tranche of documents relating to Epstein. The images appear to show Andrew kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. Being mentioned in the documents is not an indication of any wrongdoing.Prince Edward made the comments at the World Governments Summit in Dubai after being asked by a CNN journalist how he was \"coping\" with the fallout from the files.The duke replied: \"Well, with the best will in the world, I'm not sure this is the audience that is the least bit interested in that.\"They all came here to listen to education, solving the future, but no, I think it's all really important, always, to remember the victims and who are the victims in all this.\"US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor in an image from the documents relating to EpsteinAndrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew and the Duke of York, was stripped of his royal titles in October after increasing scrutiny over his links to Epstein.He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.Emails released on Friday showed a number of exchanges between Epstein and Andrew in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.The files also show there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.Calls are now growing for Andrew to give evidence of what he knows about Epstein in the US.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been amongst those calling for him to testify, and told reporters over the weekend that \"anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information\".\"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that,\" he said. \"Epstein's victims have to be the first priority.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGetty ImagesThe French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its \"potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.\"X is yet to respond to either investigation - the BBC has approached it for comment.It has previously characterised the French investigation as an attack on free speech.The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok.In a post at the time, X said the action was \"politically-motivated\" and denied allegations it had manipulated its algorithm.Following today's raid, French prosecutors say they are now investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.New UK investigationMeanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a barrage of criticism in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.The company eventually intervened to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as \"a matter of urgency\".But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.However, shortly afterwards the ICO said it was launching its own probe, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.\"The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,\" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation.A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris.'Not a free country'Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being \"the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom\". \"Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,\" he added in a post on X.Durov was arrested and detained in France in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.",

    "body": "19 minutes agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandAlex Partridge,political reporter Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson surprised everyone in 2008 when he arrived in Downing StreetPeter Mandelson's skills a political operator were so highly prized by successive Labour prime ministers that they were apparently prepared to overlook past scandals to hand him a series of senior roles.Yet the release of emails by the US Department of Justice appear to show Mandelson himself was receiving advice on political strategy from US financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Crucially, Lord Mandelson appears to have kept Epstein informed of developments in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election, as Gordon Brown made a doomed attempt to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats.On 9 May, Lord Mandelson appears to tell Epstein: \"GB now having 'secret' talks with [Lib Dem leader Nick] Clegg in Foreign Office\".And then, at 09.07am on Monday 10 May, he appears to tell Epstein: \"Finally got him to go today\".Brown's resignation as Labour leader, it was later claimed, was the price demanded by Clegg to begin coalition talks with Labour.In the end, these talks went nowhere and Clegg formed a coalition government with David Cameron's Conservatives.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment about these email exchanges, which appear to give an almost minute-by-minute account of the five days of coalition wrangling, which gripped the nation after there was no clear general election winner.On 8 May, two days after the election, while talks were taking place between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, an email appears to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein he'd spent \"all day first with [Gordon Brown] then with Libs. They are all pretty bonkers…\"Epstein suggests \"stressing\" in negotiations that the Liberal Democrat plus Labour vote is \"15m v 10 million votes\".Later the same day, the financier suggests \"why not let tories govern with minority, no coalition\" suggesting they won't be able to get \"anything done\". It seems that Lord Mandelson, whose name and email address are redacted for most but not all of the messages, replies \"cos GB thinks British economy will collapse without [him] at helm\".Epstein also passed on advice from someone referred to as \"jess\" that \"supporting gb will be seen as bad form commercially, he has lost the confidence of the public\".He added that \"jpm\" [investment bank JP Morgan] is \"very concerned that the pound could be the next currency to falter. and big time. uncertainty is not in your favor\".At the time Greece was seeking a bailout from the EU amid its debt crisis.Lord Mandelson appears to reply \"agree but method and timing is all\" saying he's \"getting messages both from people saying to take GB out and keep him there to do deal with Libs. Ideally [should] do both. But cannot see how\".On 11 May, with negotiations still ongoing, Epstein tells Lord Mandelson \"a mere opposition party, is not in your interest\" to which Lord Mandelson seems to reply \"Not sure in my interest to father a mutual suicide pact\".Epstein then suggests making \"a real offer you can live with…if clegg won't agree, it would be on his shoulders\" and if he does \"youve bought time\".Hours later Epstein receives an email saying \"It's over. I am out of govt at the end of the day…\"Later the same day, as Lord Mandelson appears to say he is attending a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, Epstein offers a \"big hug\".The email exchanges are peppered with gossipy and sometimes indiscreet comments.On 6 May 2010, as UK voters went to the polls, Epstein asks his friend how it was going, to which Mandelson apparently replies \"we are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man\".'Third time lucky'Brown's decision to bring Lord Mandelson back into government, in October 2008, stunned Westminster.The pair had once been inseparable as they worked with Tony Blair to create New Labour.But Brown had never forgiven Lord Mandelson for what he saw as his betrayal in backing Blair for the party leadership in 1994.Explaining his decision to bring his bitter rival back into the fold as business secretary and a member of the House of Lords, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\"The appointment was seen as a daring gamble by Brown, whose government was floundering in the face of the biggest economic crisis in a generation.Lord Mandelson was a divisive figure who had twice been forced to resign from Tony Blair's government.Brown hoped that his old foe's political nous and experience as an EU trade commissioner would add much-needed heft to his government's handling of the global economic crisis.\"We are bringing together the best team possible to deal with the difficulties [that we face],\" Brown told reporters. Lord Mandelson acknowledged that the pair had had their \"ups and downs\" but said they were now \"joined at the hip\".As he bowled up Downing Street to start his new job, he joked to astonished reporters that it was \"third time lucky\".PA MediaGordon Brown turned to his old rival in his hour of needIn June 2009, Lord Mandelson's status was enhanced further when Brown gave him the honorary title first secretary of state, making him the de-facto deputy prime minister.In that same month, the DoJ emails suggest Lord Mandelson forwarded an internal memo on selling off government-held assets in order to raise public funds to Epstein.The Cabinet Office has material to the police after an initial review \"found that they contain likely market sensitive information surrounding the 2008 financial crash and official activities thereafter to stabilise the economy\".Part of Lord Mandelson's mystique - and one of the reasons why he is despised by some in the Labour movement - is his love of political intrigue, gossip and plots.And this appears to be on full display in his alleged exchanges with Epstein.In early 2010, he appears to be discussing removing Brown as Labour leader or running for leader himself.On 6 February, he tells Epstein: \"If I continue as now people will say I am one of the few (only) big figures. And I have to deliver a reasonable campaign that only he [expletive]'s up. And that I perform well in the campaign itself. That I was bigger than the lot of them.\"Epstein allegedly replies: \"lets not dwell on him, i am only interested in how this plays out for you.\"Lord Mandelson allegedly says: \"Perhaps but either way - direct or not - he cannot take the truth. He needs 5 years of therapy...\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoAna FaguyWashingtonGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has urged Republicans to \"nationalise\" elections and repeated his false claims of 2020 election fraud in a new podcast interview. American elections are primarily run by state law, and voting has long been administered by local officials across the country. \"The Republicans should say: 'We want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least 15 places.' The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting,\" Trump said during an appearance on the podcast of his former deputy FBI director, Dan Bongino.His remarks come days after the FBI raided an elections office in Georgia to examine voting records from the 2020 election.In the interview, Trump did not name the \"15 places\" where he thought Republicans should \"nationalise\" voting.The president tied his desire to federalise voting mechanisms to his key agenda item of deporting undocumented immigrants from the US. \"If Republicans don't get them out, you will never win another election as a Republican,\" he said. While speaking to Bongino, Trump also referenced the FBI's raid in Georgia's Fulton County, saying that \"you're going to see some interesting things come out\".Trump narrowly lost the state to Joe Biden in 2020. He has repeatedly said his loss was due to fraud - an unsubstantiated claim.Trump faced two criminal indictments related to alleged election interference in Georgia; a federal case that ended after he returned to the White House last year, and a Georgia state racketeering case that fell apart. He denied any wrongdoing.In the new podcast interview, Trump said he won the 2020 election \"in a landslide\" and said, without evidence, that people \"vote illegally\".The FBI said last week it was conducting a \"court-authorised law enforcement activity\" at the Fulton County Election Hub. Fulton County officials said that the government's warrant \"sought a number of records related to 2020 elections\".Some local officials expressed anger at the raid.\"This is an assault on your vote,\" Fulton County Commissioner Mo Ivory said.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has confirmed that she was present for the raid, saying that Trump personally asked her to be on-site.Gabbard's first comments on the matter came in a letter that was sent to a group of senators on Monday, saying her presence was \"executed under [her] broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counterintelligence (CI), foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity\".In the letter, Gabbard also confirmed that there had been a call in the wake of the raid between FBI agents on the ground and Trump. The call, which was first reported by the New York Times, raised some eyebrows as it is unusual for a president and law enforcement handling a case like this to be in communication. Gabbard said she \"facilitated a brief phone call for the president to thank the agents personally for their work. He did not ask any questions, nor did he or l issue any directives\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesThe figure is significant but well below the 11.48 million people who filed in time (generic photo)An estimated one million people missed the deadline to file their tax return and now face penalties, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).The UK's tax authority said 27,456 people filed in the final hour before the cut-off for 2024-25 returns at midnight at the end of Saturday.After HMRC helplines stayed open and webchat services were extended at the weekend, the busiest hour of people filing through online self-assessment was from 17:00 GMT on Saturday.Some 475,722 people filed on the final day out of a total of about 11.5 million submissions. Those who missed the deadline face an automatic £100 penalty.\"Thank you to the millions of people and agents who filed their self assessment tax return and paid any tax owed by 31 January. Anyone who missed the deadline should file their return as soon as possible, as penalties and late payment interest may be charged,\" said Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's chief customer officer.Millions of people have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file each year through self-assessment.They included those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.Some who were not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who had switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.A similar number of people missed the filing deadline a year earlier. Anyone doing so faces the following penalties: An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on timeAfter three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greaterThere are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 monthsIf tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owedHMRC, which raises tens of millions of pounds each year from penalties, will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a reasonable excuse may avoid being fined.Tax analysts advise anyone appealing to still pay the initial penalty.\"Although it involves shelling out cash, it avoids you paying interest on the penalty itself from the date it became due if you lose your appeal,\" said Charlene Young, senior pensions and savings expert at investment platform AJ Bell.\"If you don't have an excuse to appeal a fine but still owe money, you might still be able to set up a payment plan to get back on track. It's essential you don't put your head in the sand.\"",

    "body": "UK launches plan to tackle 'forever chemicals' amid growing concerns17 hours agoEsme StallardClimate and science reporterGetty ImagesForever chemicals - or PFAs (per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances) - pollute long-term and don't degrade easily (generic photo)The UK is to increase testing for so-called \"forever chemicals\" in the environment as part of a national plan to tackle the substances, which have prompted environmental and health concerns.The group of chemicals, also known as PFAS, are used in many everyday products because of their oil resistant and waterproof properties.But scientists are concerned because their chemical structures mean they accumulate and remain in the environment, with a small number of PFAS known to be toxic.The government says that by 2029 it wants to align more closely with regulations issued by the EU, which is looking to prohibit all non-essential uses.Some environmental groups and the water industry have urged the government to act more quickly in banning the chemicals.But new regulations currently take around five years to put in place, and the Chemicals Industries Association has said there are some critical industries such as hydrogen production where there are few alternatives. Forever chemicals are \"one of the most pressing chemical challenges of our time,\" Environment Minister Emma Hardy said as she launched the plan. \"It's crucial that we protect both public health and the environment for future generations. Through our PFAS Plan, we will act decisively to reduce their harmful effects while transitioning to safer alternatives,\" she said.The plan centres around three key aims:increasing knowledge of where the most harmful PFAS are turning upunderstand how their use in everyday products can be reducedwork with industry to look for alternatives The number of water samples tested for PFAS will be increased by 50% across Scotland and Wales, whilst animals in coastal areas of England and soils in five priority areas will be tested to identify hotspots. PFAS are now ubiquitous in our everyday lives, used for example in school uniforms, medication casings and hydrogen production. Their incredibly strong chemical bonds give them properties which industries find very useful, such as being water-and oil-resistant, and they are also cheap to manufacture. But Dr Liz Chadwick, senior lecturer in biosciences at Cardiff University, said the chemicals leak out into the environment from manufacturing, washing our clothes or products with PFAS, as well as from the spread of waste sludge from water treatment works onto agricultural fields. \"PFAS are very persistent in the environment, they are also bioaccumulative and they are also known to be toxic, those three things together gives our rise for concern about chemicals in the environment,\" said Other household products they can be found in include cosmetics, baking equipment and frying pans, dishwasher rinse aid and polish.Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsSome clothing brands are trialling alternative chemicals to PFAS that produce the same waterproof properties As well as more testing, the government also wants to raise public awareness by launching a website dedicated to information on the chemicals. The plan has been broadly welcomed by environmental charities and scientists but there is disagreement about whether further research is needed before restrictions are put in place.\"More research, more monitoring is important, but that should not come before regulating them at the source. We should not be waiting for people to start showing adverse impacts before we take action,\" said Dr Shubhi Sharma, scientific researcher at environmental charity Chem Trust. She said the government should take a \"precautionary principle\" approach, where the use of a chemical is stopped if the potential harm could outweigh the benefits - considering the emerging risks of some PFAS.Earlier this year the World Health Organization raised significant concerns, about two specific PFAS. It classified PFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic - increasing the risk of thyroid, testicular and kidney cancers. Both substances are already banned in the UK. Dr Hannah Moody, Director of Research and Engagement at Breast Cancer UK, said the government plan was a step forward, but \"the work is not complete on this, and we will continue to lobby for tighter and more stringent regulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals that are linked to possibly increasing breast cancer risk for the entire UK population.\"Although the new plan does not include a commitment to banning PFAS, the government has said the UK will \"more closely align\" by December 2028 with EU regulations. The EU is proposing a universal ban on the chemicals unless they are proven essential for society. Closer alignment could speed up future regulation of PFAS, said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry.\"Our regulators after Brexit have been overwhelmed and busy with adapting to the changes that Brexit has caused, and so it means that doing this sort of in-depth work has often been pushed back. And so I think this is a really positive step,\" she said.  Hans Lucas_AFP/Getty ImagesFrance has banned the use of PFAS in all products where an alternative exists after significant public protestSome manufacturers have already gone PFAS-free. But doing so is expensive, said Debbie Reed at Equip Outdoor Technologies, which owns outdoor brands Rab and Lowe Alpine.\"It's challenging as our supply chains are complex, in an insulating jacket there are 120 components. To make sure the products are PFAS-free we have to make sure the entire production line is cleaned,\" she said. This was a position echoed by Jun Kamei, CEO of Amphico, a company developing toxic-free textiles.\"PFAS [are] a very functional, versatile chemistry so replacing them is a lot of hard work from a technical perspective,\" he told the BBC at a Mills Fabrica exhibit for PFAS-free designers. \"It has taken us 7 years - but a hard problem worth tackling.\"Instead of relying on voluntary phase-out, the water industry thinks the government should go much further and ban the chemicals completely.Currently water companies have to regularly test for the 48 most concerning PFAS and where levels are elevated, treat the water supply. This is a costly endeavour and something the industry says it should not be responsible for. \"While this is a useful first step, the government needs to go much further. The problem with PFAS will only get worse until chemical companies are forced to stop their manufacture and sale and clean up the mess they've already created,\" said a spokesperson for industry body Water UK. But the Chemical Industries Association pushed back and said that while it was working to find alternatives to PFAS, this is not a quick process.\"Finding suitable and viable alternatives that are environmentally better and provide the needed performance is a challenging task, often needing innovators to return to the drawing board in search of a potential replacement,\" said the trade body's spokesperson.

Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The messages between Ferguson and Epstein almost seem like he's talking about someone on his payroll, such as asking her to show business contacts round Buckingham Palace - and her daughters get included too.In a message to \"Ferg\" in March 2010, Epstein writes: \"Thank you Sarah, could you are (sic) one of your daughters show (redacted) buckingham thanks.\"An apparent reply from \"Sarah\" reads: \"Of course.\"That July, referring to a separate occasion, she apparently writes to Epstein apologising that \"the girls were not around this weekend\". \"Shows I don't crack the whip when I am not in the country!,\" the message continues. \"Actually eugie was in france and beatrice was out with dave.\"Epstein also messages to say a friend will be in London, adding: \"Any chance of your daughters saying hello.\"As more emails emerge, there's a growing impression of how much Ferguson seemed to depend on Epstein, telling him he was her \"pillar\" and confiding \"I have been so so sad\".Some of the emails date from when Epstein was still serving a sentence for soliciting sex from a minor, according to the documents. He was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. There are emails in the files from that June and earlier in the July from \"Sarah\". An email from August the following year reads: \"I am feeling very traumatised and alone. I am wanting to work for you at organising your houses.\" The next month she appears to ask \"when are you going to employ me\", and the same day \"phew.. you still love me\". Referring to her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson seems to write later in 2010: \"So you have not forgotten about me. I do know that my handsome Prince is a saint.. And you worship him, I do too. \"But then I did marry him. And still love him.\"Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently and strenuously always denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment on the release of the files.There are also messages behind her back between Epstein and his associates: \"Getting financials for fergie is painful. Incredible mess. I'm on it but for sure completeness will always remain questionable.\"She appears to tell Epstein that \"the British press is ready to exterminate me\" and that the Palace is \"not equipped to deal with all of this huge wave of negativity\". \"I am now 1000 percent being hung out to dry, just as I predicted you will see, the Press will have me exiled,\" the email continues. \"I am totally on my own now. This is beyond scandalous and nobody can do anything. I cannot believe what this is all coming to.\"She adds that \"no woman has ever left the Royal Family with her head, and (they) cannot behead me, therefore they will discredit me. Totally to obliteration\". This latest round of Epstein emails, released by the US Department of Justice, could remove her even more from public life.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesSeven million people's cancer could be prevented each year, according to the first global analysis.A report by World Health Organization (WHO) scientists estimates 37% of cancers are caused by infections, lifestyle choices and environmental pollutants that could be avoided.This includes cervical cancers caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infections which vaccination can help prevent, as well as a host of tumours caused by tobacco smoke from cigarettes.The researchers said their report showed there is a \"powerful opportunity\" to transform the lives of millions of people.Some cancers are inevitable - either because of damage we unavoidably build up in our DNA as we age or because we inherit genes that put us at greater risk of the disease.But researcher Dr Isabelle Soerjomataram said \"people are surprised to hear\" that nearly four in 10 cancers can be prevented as it is \"a substantial number\".The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the WHO, analysed 30 preventable factors known to increase the risk of cancer.These include smoking and ultraviolet (UV) radiation which can directly damage our DNA; obesity and too little physical activity which alter inflammation and hormones in the body to raise cancer risk; and air pollution which can wake up dormant cancer cells.The agency's report also looked at nine cancer-causing infections including HPV, hepatitis viruses which lead to liver cancer and the stomach bug H. pylori.The team used data on cancer cases from 2022 and from the 30 risk factors a decade earlier – across 185 countries - to perform their statistical analysis.The big three contributors to more than 18 million cancer cases around the world were found to be:smoking tobacco which caused 3.3 million cancersinfections causing 2.3 million cancersalcohol use leading to 700,000 cancers Getty ImagesSmoking and alcohol were two of the main causes of preventable cancersHowever, the overall figures mask a nuanced picture of cancer risk around the world.There is a stark sex-divide with 45% of men's cancers being preventable compared with 30% in women, partly down to higher levels of smoking among men.In women living in Europe, the top three preventable causes of cancer are smoking, closely followed by infection and then obesity.While in sub-Saharan Africa, infections dominate and account for nearly 80% of preventable cancers in women.This means any measures to tackle these cancers would need to be tailored to each region or country.\"This landmark study is a comprehensive assessment of preventable cancer worldwide, incorporating for the first time infectious causes of cancer alongside behavioural, environmental, and occupational risks,\" said Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARC Cancer Surveillance Unit.\"Addressing these preventable causes represents one of the most powerful opportunities to reduce the global cancer burden.\"The report, published in the journal Nature Medicine, showed lung cancer (linked to smoking and air pollution) stomach cancer (linked to H. pylori infection) and cervical cancer (linked to HPV infection) made up nearly half of all preventable cases of cancer.Dr Andre Ilbawi, team lead for cancer control at WHO, said the study was \"good news\" as it showed something could be done and he pointed to the success of countries that have introduced policies to tackle smoking or vaccinate against HPV.\"The percentage of preventable cancers can change over time and our goal is to get it as close to zero as possible,\" he said.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterGetty ImagesChappell Roan described her look - shown before she removed her cape - as \"so awesome and weird\"Chappell Roan has laughed off the reaction to the revealing outfit she wore on the Grammy Awards red carpet on Sunday.The US pop star removed her red chiffon cape on the red carpet to reveal a matching draped dress hung from nipple rings, leaving virtually all of her top half exposed.The Mugler ensemble was one of the most talked-about outfits at this year's ceremony.\"Giggling because I don't even think this is THAT outrageous of an outfit,\" the star posted on Instagram. \"The look's actually so awesome and weird. I recommend just exercising your free will it's really fun and silly :D.\"ReutersShe added: \"Thank you for having me @grammys and those who voted for me!!\" Some fans praised Roan's style, describing her as \"a goddess\" and \"an icon\" in response to her own Insta post.Referencing Justin Bieber's performance on Sunday wearing just boxer shorts, one wrote: \"If Justin can perform in his underwear without anyone batting an eyelid, you can rock pierced pasties diva. Misogyny.\"Nipple pasties are prosthetic nipple covers, which provide both protection and coverage.Others found her outfit was not to their taste, however.Responding to Billboard's video of Roan on the red carpet, one post read: \"I love her but this is too much. Is she gonna get banned?\", while another responded: \"I don't know what people have against wearing clothes.\"Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, fashion writer and stylist Alex Fullerton said: \"What this label (Mugler) has done consistently since the 80s has worked a lot with transparency, bare breasts, so she's honouring the legacy of the designer.\"But at the end of the day... she's got them out!\"Roan was nominated for two Grammys on Sunday - record of the year and best pop solo performance, both for The Subway, but she came away empty-handed.Known for her individual style and hits including Pink Pony Club, Hot to Go and Good Luck, Babe!,  Chappell is actually the alter-ego of the more reticent Kayleigh Amstutz.\"I couldn't be Chappell all the time,\" she admitted. \"I'd be absolutely exhausted.\"Getty ImagesCharli XCX wore a sheer black dress at the Brits last yearHer latest outfit continues the trend of celebrities wearing sheer and revealing looks on red carpets and at award ceremonies.Charli XCX wore a see-through black dress at last year's Brit Awards, and addressed the controversy over her outfit during one of her speeches on the night. \"I heard that ITV were complaining about my nipples. I feel like we're in the era of 'free the nipple' though, right?\" she said.Kanye West's wife, Bianca Censori, arrived at last year's Grammys wearing a sheer body stocking that left little to the imagination.",

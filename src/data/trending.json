    "body": "Nottingham Forest have opened talks with former Wolves boss Vitor Pereira after Sean Dyche was sacked following just 114 days in charge. Forest were held to a goalless draw at home by bottom club Wolves on Wednesday, leaving them three points above the Premier League relegation zone with 12 games remaining.Sources have told BBC Sport that Pereira is a leading contender to replace Dyche, having worked previously under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis at Greek club Olympiacos. Pereira, 57, was credited for keeping Wolves in the Premier League last season having joined mid-way through the campaign, but he was sacked in November with Wolves on two points from 10 matches. Dyche's departure means Forest are searching for their fourth permanent head coach of the season, having sacked Ange Postecoglou in October and Nuno Espirito Santo in September. \"Nottingham Forest Football Club can confirm that Sean Dyche has been relieved of his duties as head coach,\" a statement read.\"We would like to thank Sean and his staff for their efforts during their time at the club and we wish them the best of luck for the future. We will be making no further comment at this time.\"Postecoglou lasted just 39 days in the job after replacing Nuno, who was sacked just three matches into the 2025-26 campaign.Dyche took over at the City Ground with Forest 18th in the table after one win in eight games during a difficult start to the season.After a 2-0 defeat by Bournemouth in his first match in charge, Dyche led Forest to four wins and one draw in their next seven to guide them out of the drop zone.A run of four consecutive defeats followed, but Dyche's side responded with a four-match unbeaten run - including a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers West Ham and a resilient goalless draw with leaders Arsenal.However, the improved form of Leeds United and West Ham has kept Forest mired in the relegation battle.Forest finished 13th in the Europa League group table, with four wins, two draws and two defeats in their eight matches, to reach the knockout phase.They face Turkish side Fenerbahce over two legs this month for the chance to reach the last 16, with the first leg taking place on Thursday, 19 February.Forest are out of both domestic cup competitions, losing 3-2 to Swansea under Postecoglou in the EFL Cup third round in September and exiting the FA Cup on penalties to another Championship side, Wrexham, in the third round under Dyche last month.After being in contention for Champions League qualification for much of last season, Forest picked up just eight points from their final eight matches.They finished seventh and qualified for the Conference League but were moved into the Europa League for 2025-26 at Crystal Palace's expense after the Eagles were deemed to be in breach of multi-club ownership rules.During that downturn in form, Nuno's relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis deteriorated and he was sacked in September.Dyche was on the books of Forest as a youth-team player in the late 1980s when Brian Clough was manager, but never made a first-team appearance.He was previously in charge of Everton before being sacked after just under two years in charge of the Toffees in January 2025.Prior to that Dyche spent nearly a decade as Burnley manager between October 2012 and April 2022, twice winning promotion to the top flight and helping the Clarets qualify for Europe for the first time since 1967.He also had a stint in charge of Watford for the 2011–12 season, only to lose his job following a change of ownership.Following Forest's 0-0 draw with Wolves on Wednesday, Dyche sounded like a man who knew what was to follow.After an incredible 35 attempts on goal without scoring - more attempts than any team Dyche has managed in his 351 games in charge - the draw left them just three points clear of the drop zone.A frustrated Marinakis was pictured frequently during the City Ground draw with him appearing to be growing increasingly frustrated with every missed opportunity.Post match - and before his dismissal - Dyche said: \"The owner has been fair to me, without a shadow of a doubt. If anyone chooses to change in football now, that's their decision. We've all seen it.\"People can demand change, and then it's always whether they change or not.\"If the owner wants to make a change then that's up to him, and that's the way football is now, that's just the reality of it.\"I understand the noise here has changed significantly since the last few games.\"Dyche undoubtedly arrived at Forest in difficult circumstances, but he appeared to steady the ship after a poor run of results under Postecoglou, winning seven of his first 12 games.If results were taken from when Dyche took over, Forest would be mid-table, six points above third-from-bottom Tottenham.He was even nominated for Premier League manager of the month a week ago, with two wins and one loss from their past six matches.Speaking on Match of the Day, just an hour before Dyche's dismissal, ex-England striker Alan Shearer backed the former Burnley boss.He said: \"I think with his know-how and his experience in the Premier League, I would without a doubt stick with Sean.\"Former Tottenham midfielder Danny Murphy, added: \"I think for this battle at the bottom you wouldn't want a better manager than him.\"He's been there, done it, he stays calm. I think they'd be crazy to get rid of him.\"The other thing as well I suppose for Marinakis is if it wasn't for him they wouldn't be in the Premier League and they wouldn't be in Europe.\"So maybe he's got the right to do what he wants, but I don't think there's a manager you could bring in who is as capable as [Dyche] in this fight.\"Nuno was sacked 23 days into the season.His replacement Postecoglou lasted 39 days.Dyche at least made it past the 100-day mark, but his reign ends after 114.Nottingham Forest are now remarkably searching for a fourth manager of a season which has lurched from crisis to crisis.Forest's problems are of their own making after Nuno fell out with global sporting director Edu and owner Marinakis to make his position untenable.Postecoglou was an ill-advised appointment, a clash of styles going from Nuno's counter-attack to the Australian's high-pressing, high-action game.Dyche was supposed to be the safe pair of hands, reverting back to what the squad knew under Nuno, and his connection with the club - having come through the academy - initially made it a sweet homecoming.Seven wins from his first 12 stabilised the club and season to a point, with Forest mid-table in the league if results since Dyche was appointed in October were only taken into account.But just two wins in their past 10 league games - plus an FA Cup exit to Wrexham last month - saw a rapid loss of faith from both the board and the fans.The season is now an embarrassment for Forest. It was not supposed to be like this, with European football returning to the City Ground for the first time since 1995-96.But after two failed appointments and the decision to sack Nuno after a breakdown in relationships Forest are in tatters. They finished seventh last season and spent £180m but relegation is a very real possibility in a season where the club, especially Postecoglou, had targeted winning the Europa League.",

    "body": "GB start skeleton bid as Kim targets history - Thursday's guideImage caption, Updated 11 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day six: Thursday, 12 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20).Daily highlightsSkeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00)Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress sinceTwo-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day.Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30)This event promises to be one of the most entertaining – and open – of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka, Breezy Johnson, and Emma Aicher are in good form.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final – which they lost – against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05).Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA – who haven't lifted the title since 1980 – face Latvia at 20:10.The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again.The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.Day nine: Sunday, 15 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "3 hours agoBBCAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor features on the front pages of many of Thursday's papers, with the Mail writing \"now detectives discuss Andrew 'leaks' to [Jeffrey] Epstein with prosecutors\". The paper headlines on \"Labour women's fury over second paedophile crisis\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was \"skewered\" in the Commons for awarding a peerage to his former communications chief, Matthew Doyle, \"despite knowing he had stayed friends with a Labour councillor charged with child sex-offences\". Sir Keir has said Lord Doyle \"did not give a full account\" over his links to a convicted sex offender.The i Paper headlines on the \"growing police inquiry\" into Andrew's Epstein links. It writes that detectives are \"assessing claims that paedophile Jeffrey Epstein sent a woman to Windsor for 'sexual purposes' involving the former prince\". Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The Sun calls Andrew a \"credit cad\", reporting that the \"Queen, Philip and Charles loaned Andy £12m for Virginia pay-off\" but \"he hasn't paid back a penny\".There is \"outrage at Prem boss\" writes the Daily Mirror, calling billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe \"shameful\" for his comment that Britain had been \"colonised by immigrants\". The paper also says a picture released in the latest Epstein files of Andrew on all fours above a woman, both fully dressed, shows a \"sex-traffic victim\". The Daily Express also leads on the claims from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, highlighting his comments that \"new arrivals to Britain are 'costing too much money'\".The Daily Star reports a \"Man U Jim 'racism' storm\" after Sir Jim's comments. He has been \"slammed\", it adds, noting that a \"furious\" Sir Keir is \"demanding an apology\". Labour is \"up for\" closer ties with the EU writes the Daily Telegraph in its headline. A photo of Mick Jagger and his fiancee Melanie Harrick is used to mark reports she was \"attacked outside Annabel's\", the private members club in London. The Telegraph also says dogs have been accused of ruining relationships by staring at owners \"during intimate moments\". \"No heavy petting with Fido in the bedroom,\" it advises.For the Guardian, female Labour MPs' demand that the prime minister \"select female deputy to end 'boys club'\" make the lead. It notes that Sir Keir has said Lord Doyle \"did not give a full account of his actions\" before being nominated for his peerage. Metro leads with a \"jammy dodger\", reporting that a prolific fare evader admitted 112 offences but was spared jail. The man owed at least £3,600 for the journeys and £31,742 in financial orders for past fare dodging, it reports.The biggest wealth managers \"take beating in latest round of disruption from AI\" headlines the Financial Times. Also on its front page, a snap of the helmet of Ukrainian Olympic athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych - it features the faces of Ukrainian athletes who have died in the war. It comes as Kyiv is \"gearing up\" for presidential elections and a referendum on any peace deal with Russia, the FT writes.The prime minister is coming under increasing pressure to appoint a woman as his de facto deputy and end Number 10's \"boys club\", according to the Guardian. One of the party's most senior figures, Harriet Harman, has called on Sir Keir Starmer to revive the role of first secretary of state - a post previously held by Peter Mandelson under Gordon Brown.Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she's \"up for\" taking Britain closer to the EU, according to the Daily Telegraph. Speaking at an event in London, Reeves said closer relations represented the \"biggest prize\" for the economy. The report notes that is a significant shift from comments she made in Davos last month, when the Chancellor said Britain could not \"go back in time\" in its relationship with the EU.The Metro leads on a warning from the Shadow Transport Secretary Richard Holden, who says fare dodgers are harming the UK. The paper says his comments came after a man who used trains for two years without buying a ticket, totalling £3,600  in free journeys, was spared prison. \"Jammy dodger\" reads its headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoSteven McKenzie,Highlands and Islands reporterandChris MacLennanWatch: The moment thieves target an Inverness chip shopPolice Scotland says organised crime gangs are targeting chip shops, takeaways  and restaurants for their used cooking oil.The liquid is often left in containers outside premises to be taken away to be recycled for potential use as biodiesel, a renewable fuel for transport such as buses and tractors.Across Scotland, 178 incidents of cooking oil thefts were reported to police between April and October last year.Grant Cranston said he was surprised by how brazen the thieves who targeted his Inverness chip shop were, adding: \"It was broad daylight. There were people walking around.\"Prices paid to caterers for their oil can depend on how much is available for collection and its quality, but according to the industry, a restaurant could get about 30p a litre.'Organised element'Police Scotland said the incidents it recorded last year totalled about £20,000 in lost revenue to catering businesses.Ch Insp Craig Still, area commander for Inverness - where about 20 thefts have been reported between April and October - said the thefts could result in several problems for caterers.\"There is the inconvenience, there is the potential damage caused by the individuals who are entering premises or outside storage to take the oil - and there's also the loss of revenue as well,\" he said.\"We tend to find there is an organised criminal element in this.\"It's quite often sold on to legitimate oil recyclers who would then manufacture things like biodiesel, which has obviously become more prevalent as technology moves on in relation to production of fuels.\"Grant Cranston said the thefts were an added problem for the struggling fish and chips industryUsed cooking oil was stolen from a container outside Hilton Chip Shop in Inverness.Co-owner Grant Cranston said thefts were another problem for his trade to have to deal with.\"Fish and chips at the minute is really, really struggling with rising costs of everything, the VAT, things like that,\" he said.Cranston said the industry was trying to play its part in responsible disposal of used oil.He said: \"You put that out there for it to go away and to be recycled, kind of doing your bit for the environment.\"Stories you may have missedAndrew Crook, president of the National Federation of Fish Friers, said some UK chip shops were being repeatedly targeted.\"I think nationally it is a big issue, it's £30-40 per drum,\" he said.\"If you're going round at night and targeting 10 shops on a regular basis, it's quite a good income for somebody.\"Crook added: \"One shop said he's lost thousands of pounds because quite a lot of the distributors collect the oil and then they recycle it and you get a credit on your account.\"He lost all those credits because the drum kept disappearing overnight.\"It happened for nine months, so for that business it was a significant impact.\"Police Scotland said businesses should ensure oil was stored in a secure and well-lit location, and monitored by CCTV if possible.Ch Insp Craig Still added: \"Our prevention and interventions team is always happy to attend premises and give some advice around building safety and security.\"Related internet links",

The BBC has reached out to Cort's representatives.A veteran actor of stage and screen, Cort appeared in more than 80 films and TV series, including Wes Anderson's quirky comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.But it was his star turn as a young, death obsessed Harold who falls in love with Maude, a charming elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon, in Hal Ashby's beloved film that stayed with audiences throughout his 50-year career.While Harold and Maude was originally a commercial and critical flop, it later gained traction in the 1970s through a loyal cult following thanks to its unique dark humour and quirky romantic pairing.\"A young man obsessed with death falls in love with an old woman obsessed with life. She dies and teaches the kid how to live,\" Cameron Crowe described it for AFI in 2011. \"And it's done with music [by Cat Stevens] that scratches at your soul... that movie holds up - to this minute.\"CBS Photo ArchiveA young Bud Cort as Harold Chasen in Harold and MaudeDirector Edgar Wright paid tribute to the actor's work, calling him a \"welcome and magnetic presence in every film lucky enough to have him\".On his performance in Harold and Maude, Wright said: \"Not only is this beloved film a pitch perfect black comedy-cum-love story for the ages, but Bud Cort delivers one of the greatest looks to camera in film.\"The role earned him acting nominations for a Golden Globe and a Bafta.Born in New Rochelle, New York in 1948, Cort showed an early interest in performing and acting in many school productions.Getty ImagesHannaway remembered him as a \"passionate theatregoer\" who would sneak off to Manhattan to see Broadway shows and wait at the backstage door hoping to catch a glimpse of Barbara Streisand after watching Funny Girl.Moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s to pursue a career in film, he was cast in a small part in the 1970 film M*A*S*H, before landing the titular role in Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud.Cort worked steadily throughout his career with supporting roles in films such as Heat, Dogma and Invaders from Mars.He also appeared in several popular TV series including Arrested Development, Ugly Betty and Criminal Minds.",

    "body": "5 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA Media/EPALeft to right: Lord Peter Mandelson, Sir Keir Starmer and Lord Matthew Doyle (composite image)We are currently witnessing the curious spectacle of two men, both of whom have served as the prime minister's director of communications within the last year, on opposite sides of a public row over the controversial appointment of one of them to the House of Lords.Tim Allan, who was in charge of Sir Keir Starmer's communications until he resigned on Monday, has issued a statement, first published by The Times, in which he says he spoke to Lord Matthew Doyle about his connections to a sex offender before the now peer was offered seat in the Upper House.It is a reminder of the staff turnover there has been in Downing Street in Sir Keir's first 18 months or so in office – and indeed just this week, as Allan refers to the also now departed former Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney.And it substantiates the argument Sir Keir himself made in the House of Commons.\"I was asked to speak to Matthew Doyle by Morgan McSweeney regarding Doyle's  relationship with Sean Morton. I accurately relayed what Doyle had told me to the PM. The PM is right to state that Doyle did not tell me about his campaigning in a council election for Morton. Doyle did however tell me that he had believed Morton's protestations of innocence prior to his conviction and had been supportive of him during that time.\"I have offered Lord Doyle a right of reply at each stage of this story over the last day or so and he has so far declined to comment. In an earlier statement he said he apologised for an \"error of judgement\" in choosing to campaign for a man who had been charged over images of child sexual abuse.And all this after the prime minister was told to his face by one of his own MPs, Emma Lewell, that the last few weeks had led to people \"screaming at me in the street that I am a member of the paedo protectors party\".The remarks, at a private meeting of Labour MPs and peers with the prime minister, hadn't been intended to be heard beyond the room in which they were made. But they are an insight into the fear that the noisy revelations of the last few weeks are cutting through to the wider electorate, are being noticed.This latest row has prompted fresh concerns within Labour about the prime minister's judgement, as there are striking parallels with the last one about Lord Mandelson.A prominent Labour figure is offered a job in the prime minister's gift, only for revelations to emerge that lead some to question the wisdom of the appointment. The prime minister then publicly criticises the person he gave the job to and criticises the vetting process for their appointment.Am I talking here about Lord Mandelson or Lord Doyle? As different as the two cases are in their specifics, I could be talking about either when it comes to how their jobs came about.There are now calls within the Labour Party for Lord Doyle to be stripped of his peerage, under the new law originally planned to remove Lord Mandelson's seat in the Lords.As for the prime minister, he must be mighty glad the half-term break is now imminent and Parliament will be in recess for a week.He could no doubt use a firebreak from the recent political heat.",

    "body": "5 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesRussian regulators are pushing a state-developed app as an alternative to WhatsAppRussia has \"attempted to fully block\" WhatsApp in the country, the company said, as the Kremlin continues to tighten restrictions on messaging apps.Meta-owned WhatsApp said the move aims to push more than 100 million of its app users in Russia to a \"state-owned surveillance app\".This comes after Russian regulators further curbed access to Telegram, citing a lack of security. Telegram is estimated to have as many users as WhatsApp in Russia.The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\"Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,\" said WhatsApp in a statement.\"We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.\"Russia's communications regulator, the Roskomnadzor, has made repeated warnings to WhatsApp to comply with local law.State-owned Tass Media reported earlier this year that WhatsApp is expected to be permanently blocked in the country in 2026.\"Such harsh measures\" are \"absolutely justified\" since Russia has designated Meta as an extremist organisation, Andrei Svintsov, a Russian official, was quoted as saying.Since that designation in 2022, Meta apps like Instagram and Facebook have been blocked in Russia and are only accessible through virtual private networks.The app has been likened to China's WeChat - a so-called \"super app\" that combines messaging and government services, but without encryption.Russia has argued that both WhatsApp and Telegram have refused to store Russian users' data in the country as required by law. Since 2025, the authorities have mandated that the Max app be pre-installed on all new devices sold in the country. Public sector employees, teachers and students have been required to use the platform.Telegram's chief executive, Russian-born businessman Pavel Durov, said the state is restricting access to its service in an attempt to force its people to use its own app for surveillance and political censorship.Iran has tried a similar strategy to ban Telegram and push its people to a state-run alternative, but citizens have found ways to work around this, he wrote online.\"Restricting citizens' freedom is never the right answer,\" said Durov.",

Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Share your experiences hereNorbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesLegislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote at the next general election is beginning its journey through Parliament.The Representation of the People Bill, which also includes measures to tighten the rules around political donations and protect against foreign interference, will be introduced on Thursday.Meanwhile, the government said seven councils in England will test out using locations such as train stations or supermarkets for polling booths in May's local elections to make it easier for people to vote.The government said lowering the voting age would engage young people in democracy and ensure their voices are heard.However, opponents of the idea question whether 16-year-olds have enough life experience to vote.Shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly said: \"The Conservatives are clear that people become adults at 18 and that is when citizenship rights – such as voting – should be gained.\"The minimum voting age is already 16 for local council elections in Scotland and Wales, as well as elections to the Senedd and Scottish Parliament.But for other elections, including to the UK Parliament, local elections in England and all elections in Northern Ireland, it is 18.The proposals to lower the voting age to 16 across the UK would be the biggest change to the electorate since it was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969.To become law, the bill must be approved by both MPs and peers, a process which can take months.The government has said it is aiming for the changes to be in force by the next general election, which is due to take place by 2029 but could be called earlier than this.Critics have claimed the move to lower the voting age is opportunistic, as younger people are more likely to vote for left-wing parties.In the UK, 16 and 17-year-olds make up only around 3% of the population aged 16 and over so researchers say the impact on overall vote share is likely to be negligible, particularly as turnout tends to be lower for younger age groups.Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokeswoman Lisa Smart said votes at 16 were \"long overdue\" but the bill was \"nowhere near enough to fix a democracy that's in crisis\".\"We need to scrap our broken, unfair voting system, finally make the House of Lords democratic, and stamp out the influence of foreign adversaries in our elections altogether,\" she added.The bill also includes measures to strengthen the rules around foreign donations.Currently political parties can only accept donations from individuals registered on a UK electoral register or UK-registered companies which carry out business in the country.However, there have been concerns that foreign nationals could get around the rules by donating through a foreign company that is registered in the UK.Under the government's proposals, companies making political donations will have to show they have a genuine connection to the UK, including demonstrating they are headquartered here, majority owned or controlled by UK electors or citizens and have generated sufficient revenue in the UK to cover the donation.Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said: \"The Representation of the People Bill will usher in a new era for our democracy – one that protects against foreign interference and empowers young people.\"With growing threats from abroad, now is the time to make changes to make our elections secure and get young people engaged in them.\"Other measures in the government's elections strategy, which are expected to be part of the bill, include expanding forms of voter ID in Great Britain to include UK-issued bank cards and moving towards automatic voter registration",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyAFP via Getty ImagesMourners left flowers near the scene of the shooting in the remote Canadian town of Tumbler RidgeAn 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman. \"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Van Rootselaar was known to police, and \"we've begun the process of reaching out to\" the public health care system to \"understand what interactions may have taken place,\" British Columbia Premier David Eby told a news conference outside the Tumbler Ridge town hall late on Wednesday evening.The suspect previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told told reporters late on Wednesday that the close-knit community was \"one big family.\"\"Lend your ear when someone needs your ear,\" he said, growing emotional at times. \"Lend your shoulder when someone needs your shoulder. Give somebody a hug.\"Are you in Tumbler Ridge? Get in touch here",

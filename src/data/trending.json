This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "2 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsGetty ImagesA total of 69 schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will be forced to close on Monday after coloured play sand was recalled due to asbestos risk, the government has said.A recall for the products, which were found to have traces of asbestos in some samples, was issued by Kmart and Target on Saturday. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said there was a \"low\" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation.Inspections of the schools are under way and could \"take days\", said ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry in a post on Facebook. She added that air testing so far has come back \"negative to airborne asbestos\" from all schools.This comes after several schools and preschools in the region were fully or partially closed on Friday, after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand sold by Officeworks. There were also school closures in New Zealand due to fears over sand products, with at least two other schools set to close for testing on Monday according to the New Zealand Herald. Addressing the new closures, Berry said:  \"Unfortunately, these sand products are even more widely used in our schools than the Officeworks products.\"The Australian Competition & Consumer CommissionState Emergency Service volunteers and school staff have been walking through buildings and \"mapping all coloured sand they see\" over the weekend, she added. The ACT government said that people who have been in contact with the product do not require a clinical assessment. Berry said despite the minimal risk, the government is \"required to eliminate risk as much as reasonably practicable\".Up to 23 schools will remain open as they either have \"small stocks\" of the sand or do not have any of the product. The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Active Sandtub 14 piece Sand Castle Building Set, and Blue, Green and Pink Magic Sand. Asbestos, once widely used in building materials, can release toxic fibres into the air   if disturbed or processed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer. Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.",

    "body": "Five dead following 'devastating' two-car crash39 minutes agoTony BailieBBC News NIRTEGardaí (Irish police) at the scene of fatal road crash near Dundalk in County LouthFive people have died and three others have been injured in a road crash in Dundalk in County Louth.Gardaí (Irish police) said the three men and two women who died were all under the age of 25 and were travelling in a car which collided with another vehicle on the Ardee Road at Gibstown just after 21:00, local time, on Saturday. It is understood that the deceased may have been travelling to a location to socialise when the crash occurred.Gardaí said on Sunday morning that \"the vehicles and bodies of the deceased all remain at scene\". Speaking at the scene Supt Charlie Armstrong, said gardaí are investigating all the circumstances of the crash.He added: \"Yesterday evening just after 21:00 there was a serious road traffic collision involving two vehicles, a Volkswagen Golf and a Toyota Land Cruiser.\"Five occupants of the Volkswagen Golf, three males and two females all in their early 20s, were deceased at the scene.Supt Armstrong said another occupant of the Volkswagen Golf, a male in his 20s, was removed and brought to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, for treatment of serious non-life-threatening injuries.\"The two occupants of the second vehicle, a male and a female, were also taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, for medical treatment for non-life-threatening injuries.\"'Deep impact on families'Supt Armstong appealed  for privacy for the victim's families.\"This tragedy, with the loss of five young adults will have a deep impact on families and local communities in Carrickmacross, Dromconrath and in Scotland,\" he said.\"This is a shocking, devastating event for these families, their communities and the community here in Dundalk.\"He also commended his Garda colleagues and other emergency service who attended the scene last night.\"The scene was very difficult, in adverse weather conditions and the professionalism shown by all first responders and the care and respect shown to the five deceased was exemplary,\" Supt Armstrong said.Gardaí said the road remains closed between the N52 and the R171, pending a technical examination by Garda Forensic Collision Investigators.

A man in his 30s reportedly broke into the star's property in Guri with a weapon and threatened the two women.But the 34-year-old singer's agency told South Korean media that Nana - whose real name is Im Jin-ah - and her mother managed to subdue the intruder until police arrived.The actor's mother lost consciousness during the disturbance, and both she and Nana required medical attention, the Yonhap news agency reported.A local detective told AFP news agency that the intruder was attempting to steal valuables and had been detained on charges of aggravated robbery.The suspect reportedly threatened both women and demanded money after breaking into the house.Nana and her mother called the police after restraining the man, who was also taken to hospital for treatment, local media said.Nana rose to fame in 2009 with the popular K-pop girl group After School.The group is no longer active but she has since gained popularity over the past decade as an actor. She has starred in several TV series, including Kill It and Justice, both crime dramas which first aired in 2019.Nana released her first solo album in September.",

    "body": "5 days agoEmily HoltBBC NewsGetty ImagesNow the clocks have gone back and the evenings are darker, many of us are trudging to work and back in the dark and sometimes our mood is lower as well.We can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or \"winter depression\" can affect anyone. For those struggling to stick to their normal daily activites, the NHS advises contacting their local GP. For those with milder symptoms, here are three ways to help you manage the darker days and even embrace them.1. Focus on what you can do Getty ImagesPsychologist Kari Leibowitz says growing up in the US in a summer-centric town meant she used to view winter as limiting and uncomfortable, but travelling to Norway where some places get almost no daylight in the depths of winter changed her mindset.She found that instead of people succumbing to a darker mood, they embraced their circumstances, finding different hobbies from snow sports to knitting and cooking. \"They're looking at winter as a time of year that's full of opportunities,\" she says. Kari said it taught her that changing your approach to focus on what you can do during this time, rather than what you can't, was surprisingly effective.This could include winter walks, movie nights, cooking a new meal or ice skating.\"So often we only focus on the things that are harder to do in the winter when really there's a whole world of seasonal activities that feel better when it's cold out.\" 2. Accept you need more restGetty ImagesWith our work and social calendars ticking along as normal, we may wonder why we feel so tired but Kari says we need to accept our bodies need more rest in winter.\"It's actually good not to be as productive or active as you would be during the summer months because our bodies are biologically hardwired for rest during winter,\" she says. Just like animals and plants, she says we should be slowing down and changing our behaviour.Dr Em May Armstrong, a plant researcher, says the key is finding the balance between resting more and becoming too lethargic. She suggests so called \"active dormancy\" - mixing a slower restful lifestyle with activities that still keep us mentally engaged. This could include activities such as knitting, repairing clothes or practices that help get you ready for the year ahead. \"And while that's not as active as, say, travelling or camping, it's just as active in a more restorative way.\"3. Make plansGetty ImagesWhile resting more is natural, it is still important to make time for the things that make us happy and to mix with other people, according to GP Gavin Francis.\"We're very social animals, even the most solitary human being doesn't live completely alone. We all depend on others.\"He suggests planning activities in advance, focusing on spending time with those who make you feel good, and activities which can boost your mood.Doing this means you're committed, and a low mood nearer the time won't be able to stop you.\"You can then start planning in your diary to do more things with these people over winter,\" he says. Simple practical things to improve your mood, such as making sure you get a good night's sleep, avoiding too much alcohol or late night parties and maintaining a healthy diet are also important, he says.\"These things are not rocket science, but they're really fundamental to having a good, healthy circadian rhythm and a good healthy physiology through the winter.\"  Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "5 days agoLaura CressGuinness World RecordsA Hungarian man has set a new record for longest video game marathon by playing the rhythm-based music game Dance Dance Revolution for six days.Szabolcs Csépe, from Budapest, bopped to over 3000 songs and burned more than 22,000 calories in his quest to romp into the record books.The 34-year-old, known as GrassHopper on his gaming channels, said that preparation for the marathon took six months and included physical training, focusing on his \"legs and glutes\", as well a a diet plan.\"Playing DDR is always fun for me,\" he told BBC News, \"so this challenge was best described as tediously joyful\".His feat has been officially recognised by Guinness World Records.Dance Dance Revolution is a Japanese video game series which was first released to arcades in 1998.Players stand on a dance platform or mat and hit coloured arrows with their feet, to score points in time with visual cues and the music from a catalogue of songs.The series has spawned dozens of spin-offs in arcades and many more across home consoles.The games have also become popular as a way to keep fit, featuring in UK and US school exercise programmes. In 2004 the series was even recognised as an official sporting event in Norway.More recently the game has grown in popularity in the esports community, with players across the world competing in official and fan-run tournaments.Getty ImagesDance Dance Revolution started life as an arcade game in 1998.Mr Csépe said he was inspired to try the challenge after watching the attempt of previous holder Carrie Swidecki, from the US, who spent a little over 138 hours playing Just Dance in 2015.But the avid gamer, who works in IT engineering, had already broken several records before attempting this dancing feat. In 2021, he achieved the longest videogame marathon playing a Naruto game (28 hr 11 min 32 sec playing Narutimetto Akuseru 2) and the longest videogame marathon playing a puzzle game (32 hr 32 min 32 sec playing Tetris Effect).And in 2023, a 90-hour gaming session on Gran Turismo 7 earned him three more endurance-testing accolades, including the longest videogame marathon playing a racing simulator game.Mr Csépe, who earned the nickname GrassHopper as a child because he was \"always jumping around\", told the BBC he had been playing Dance Dance Revolution for almost 20 years, but the marathon was far from a dance in the park.Mr Csépe said he was allowed to have breaks \"through well-earned rest times\", with one hour of dancing earning him a ten minute break, which could be accumulated to allow him to sleep for an hour or two.Despite the immense effort, the world record holder added that if the record got beaten in the future, he would \"certainly return\" to defend his dancing crown.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterTackling illegal migration in the UK is a \"moral mission\", the home secretary has said, as she prepares to unveil major plans to overhaul asylum policy.New measures set to be announced by Shabana Mahmood on Monday will include people granted asylum needing to wait 20 years before they can apply to settle permanently.The plans will also see those granted asylum have their refugee status regularly reviewed and those whose home countries are then deemed safe told to return.Mahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she felt illegal migration was \"tearing the country apart\". Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the Conservatives would deport illegal migrants \"within a week\", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for asylum seekers to have the right to work.The changes are aimed at making the UK a less attractive destination for illegal migrants, leading to reduced small boat crossings and asylum claims.Many specific details and practicalities of the measures are yet to be made clear, and will be set out by Mahmood on Monday.Mahmood added her plans also aimed to address \"unfair\" conditions that she said gave some asylum seekers better provisions than UK citizens.She said: \"I know illegal migration is causing huge divides here in our own country, and I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.\"Currently refugee status lasts for five years, after which people can apply for indefinite leave to remain or settled status. Mahmood wants to lengthen this to 20 years.The new measures will see refugee statuses reviewed after two-and-a-half years, and then regularly reviewed thereafter.Mahmood told the BBC that asylum seekers who use \"safe and legal routes\", find work and contribute to society may be able to apply to settle permanently earlier, though did not give specific details.The policy has been copied from Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.In Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.However, Mahmood's hardline approach has already faced opposition from Labour MPs, including Clive Lewis, who told the BBC the Danish system echoed \"talking points of the far right\" and warned leftwing Labour voters may turn to the Green Party in response.Mahmood rejected this, saying: \"I am the child of migrants myself, my parents came to this country lawfully in the late 60s, and in the 70s. Immigration is absolutely woven into my experience as a Brit and also that of thousands of my constituents.\"This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.\"The home secretary was pressed on previously calling the UK a \"golden ticket\" for asylum seekers, despite the UK being \"less generous\" than France, Germany and Denmark when it came to support, and asked why she wanted to revoke asylum-seeker support.She said criminal gangs were selling packages to UK to asylum seekers, telling them they will receive free hotels and food, and that \"we know we need to deal with those pull factors\".The current system had \"no expectation\" that the 10% of asylum seekers have the right to work will actually support themselves, she says, and there is also no expectation that \"if you break the law of this country you lose your accommodation\". \"That actually places those individuals in a better position than most British citizens in social housing in this country,\" she said, adding: \"I think that is a basic principle of fairness.\"However, Philp dismissed Mahmood's plans as \"gimmicks\" that were merely \"tinkering with the edges\" of the problem.\"I don't object to it in principle, but it's not going to work,\" he told the BBC. \"I would go even further and say if someone gets here illegally they won't be able to claim asylum at all and should be deported within a week.\"Davey said his party had \"some concerns\" about the government's proposed changes to asylum in the UK, but would \"look at the details\".He argued asylum seekers should be given the right to work, as they then \"wouldn't need [government] support\", and this would be \"better for the economy, and better for asylum seekers\".Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year timeframe would \"leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years\".\"We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,\" he told BBC Breakfast on Sunday. A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the UK in the 12 months to March this year, a 17% increase on the year before, according to government data. Mr Solomon said concern about the increasing number of asylum claims was because people feel \"the government has forgotten about their communities\".According to the latest Home Office figures, 1,069 migrants arrived in the UK in the last seven days.Figures show there have been 10,289 arrivals by small boats since Mahmood became home secretary on 5 September this year. The total so far for 2025 is more than 39,000.The number of arrivals this year is higher than the whole of 2024 (36,816) and 2023 (29,437), but below the total at this point in 2022 (39,929).",

    "body": "9 hours agoRuth Comerford and Ethirajan Anbarasan,Global Affairs reporterWatch: Protesters against violent crime and the Sheinbaum government clash with police in Mexico CityAt least 120 people - 100 of them police officers - have been injured in clashes during anti-government protests in Mexico City, police said.Thousands of demonstrators marched in the Mexican capital on Saturday to protest against violent crime and President Claudia Sheinbaum's government.Sheinbaum said the marches, which also took place in other cities, had been funded by right-wing politicians who oppose her government.The rally was organised by Gen Z youth groups, drawing support from citizens protesting against high-profile killings, including the assassination just weeks ago of Uruapan Mayor Carlos Manzo - who had called for tough action against cartels.Demonstrators dismantled parts of a barrier protecting the National Palace, where Sheinbaum lives. Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.EPAManzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"ReutersSome protesters paid tribute to Uruapan mayor Carlos ManzoSheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

As it attempts to drive off, one of the agents points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. \nWith the Trump administration characterising the incident as “domestic terrorism”, alleging Renee Good had “harassed” officers all day prior to the shooting, the mayor of Minneapolis has labelled this account “bullshit” and called on immigration officers to get out of the city. The governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, is calling for a full investigation but says a fair outcome will be difficult because \"people in positions of power\" - naming Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem - have \"already passed judgement\". Walz says they've shared information that he says is \"verifiably false\" and \"inaccurate\" and made assumptions about Renee Good's character and actions ahead of the shooting.\nIn today’s episode, Justin, Sarah and Marianna discuss the reasons why Americans can’t agree on what happened in the videos posted to social media, and reflect on whether the shooting has the capacity to lead to a larger protest movement across the nation. And, as recent polling suggests more Americans are growing dissatisfied with some of the tactics used by ICE, we ask what it would take to change Donald Trump’s mind on his flagship deportations policy.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "16 hours agoJiyar GolBBC News PersianTehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won seven world crowns, eight Masters titles and eight UK Championships since turning professional in 1992ByLorraine McKennaBBC Sport journalistRonnie O'Sullivan has withdrawn from the Masters for medical reasons. The 50-year-old world number eight, who won a record-extending eighth title in 2024, also pulled out of last year's event on medical grounds. He was due to face Australian Neil Robertson in the opening round on Wednesday but has now been replaced in the draw by Scottish Open champion Chris Wakelin.O'Sullivan, who claimed his first Masters crown in 1995 at the age of 19, said he made the \"nightmare decision\" not to take part in the Triple Crown event in 2025 because he was under a lot of pressure and \"lost the plot\". The exact nature of his medical condition has not been disclosed.O'Sullivan has cited medical reasons or the need to prioritise his mental health for his withdrawals from serveral tournaments in recent years, including the British Open, Wuhan Open and World Grand Prix. 'The Rocket', who now lives in Dubai with his family, last competed at the UK Championship in December when he was beaten 6-4 in the first round by China's Zhou Yuelong at York Barbican. After his elimination, the Englishman said he was still unsure whether he would play at the Masters and would wait to see how he felt in January.His next opportunity to play competitively in Britain will be either the Tour Championship in Manchester at the end of March or the World Championship in Sheffield in April.O'Sullivan will be disappointed to miss out  - analysisJamie BroughtonBBC 5 Live Snooker ReporterThis is the second year running the record eight-time champion has been forced to withdraw from the Masters on medical grounds.And he'll be very disappointed to miss out on playing in one of his favourite tournaments. This Triple Crown event only features the world's top-16 ranked players and is one of the most prestigious tournaments to win.O'Sullivan always receives an incredible reception when he plays at Ally Pally, and many snooker fans were looking forward to watching his match against the two-time winner Neil Robertson on Wednesday night - which was arguably the pick of the first-round action.Robertson will now face Wakelin, who has played well this season, having already won the Scottish Open.",

    "body": "2 hours agoA number of the papers have splashed on the ongoing demonstrations across Iran, which began two weeks ago in response to the nation's economic woes. \"Regime teeters in Tehran\" reads the headline of the Times, leading on remarks from US President Donald Trump, after he told Fox News that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was \"looking to flee the country\".The Guardian says that Iran is preparing for \"violent clashes\" as tensions continue to escalate, pairing its leading story with a photo of a protester gesticulating in front of a burning building in Tehran. Khamenei has warned that authorities will \"not back down\", which the paper says could set the stage for an \"intensified violent crackdown\" on the second day of a national internet shutdown.\"Tehran hardens crackdown on protesters 'working for Trump'\" reads the weekend edition of the Financial Times. Iranian officials have said that protesters will receive the maximum punishment, with diplomats concerned that the \"cover of the internet blackout\" could be used to suppress the demonstrations. The paper says that the protests \"present the biggest domestic threat to the regime in several years\". The Duke of Sussex will ask King Charles III to open the Invictus Games in Birmingham next year, according to the Sun. Founded by Prince Harry in 2014, the games sees injured military personnel and veterans from around the world compete in a range of sports every two years. A source told the paper that the 2027 iteration of the event would be a brilliant chance for the pair to \"come together\".Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured in the English countryside on the front page of the Mirror, after she released a new video to mark her 44th birthday. In the footage, the princess said she was \"deeply grateful\" for the healing power of Mother Nature, as she reflected on \"what it means to be alive\".\"Kate's 'deeply grateful' for nature's healing power\" reads the Express, pointing towards Catherine's ongoing \"cancer recovery\".The shadow secretary of state for justice, Robert Jenrick, has penned a piece for the Saturday edition of the Telegraph, declaring that police are \"giving in to Islamists because it is too challenging to confront them\". His remarks come as the Labour government prepares a new official definition of Islamophobia, which free speech campaigners claim could prevent legitimate criticism of the religion.The i Weekend says that the Home Office is set to start evicting asylum seekers from hotels, ahead of new legislation planned for the spring.The Mail suggests that thousands of Britons have been prescribed \"super-strength cannabis\" as a treatment for anxiety and depression. The paper found that specialist pharmacies had referred patients to \"almost 10,000 different products\" via a \"shocking loophole\".\"Loot Littler\" announces the Star, after darts champion Luke Littler, 18, signed a historic sponsorship deal worth a reported £20m. The front page of the Guardian shows a burning building, and fire engulfing a row of cars in Tehran, with the headline saying Iran is preparing for \"violent clashes\". The Times uses a picture of a crowd of demonstrators marching through the streets of the Iranian capital. Its headline says the Ayatollah's regime is \"teetering\". The Telegraph says Ali Khamenei is facing his \"gravest threat\" - and that he fears defections by the armed forces and police.The Telegraph carries an article by the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, in which he says British police forces are \"giving in to Islamists\". Responding to the row about Maccabi Tel Aviv fans being barred from a football match in Birmingham, he says officers are \"too defeatist\" to enforce the law, claiming that they want to \"placate community relations\".The i Weekend says the government will \"ramp up\" measures to close asylum hotels, with evictions beginning in the spring. It forms part of changes to the asylum system previously announced by the home secretary - which include reducing the support the government is legally required to give refugees. The i quotes a senior Labour MP as saying they expect \"big movement\" on the closure of asylum hotels in \"the next couple of months\".The Daily Mail says high-strength cannabis is being prescribed by private clinics to treat anxiety and depression. It says a \"shocking loophole\" allows the drug to be given to patients after \"just one video consultation\". The government says it expects regulators to \"crack down\" on private companies who prescribe medicine without \"proper clinical care\".The Sun says the Duke of Sussex will ask his father King Charles III to open the Invictus Games when they are held in Birmingham next year. It calls the move a \"major thawing of relations\". A source is quoted as saying the games \"represent a cause close to both Charles and Harry's hearts\". The Sun calls the move an attempt to \"clear the heir\".And the continued success of the darts world champion, Luke Littler, is the focus of The Daily Star. Heralding his £20m sponsorship deal, the paper says \"Loot Littler\" has gone \"from kebabs to riches\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "A man and woman who were shot by an immigration agent in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, officials said.In a news conference on Friday, Portland Police Chief Bob Day confirmed that both \"do have some involvement\" with the gang, but did not elaborate on the extent of their alleged connection.Federal officials have said the agent was forced to open fire on the pair after the driver attempted to run him over during a traffic stop. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said the two are gang members who \"weaponised their vehicle against Border Patrol\".Both are conscious in hospital and \"on the road to recovery\", Day said.On Friday DHS identified the wounded driver as Luis David Nino-Moncada, who it said illegally entered the US in 2022 and has since been arrested for allegedly driving under the influence (DUI) and unauthorised use of a vehicle.The other passenger wounded was Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras, who reportedly entered the US illegally in 2023 near El Paso, Texas.DHS has alleged that \"Contreras played an active role in a Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and was involved with a prior shooting in Portland\". Federal officials said some US media had incorrectly reported the two are a married couple.According to the department, when the agents identified themselves at a traffic stop, the driver tried to run them over.\"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired a defensive shot. The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene,\" it has said.They then drove five miles (8km) to an apartment complex where they called for emergency medical help, according to DHS.On Friday, Day said the two had a \"nexus\" to a shooting that took place in July, in which the victim claimed to have been attacked by Tren de Aragua members. He did not  give more details of the alleged connection.\"This information in no way is meant to disparage or to condone or support or agree with any of the actions that occurred yesterday,\" he said. \"But it is important that we stay committed to the rule of law, that we stay committed to the facts, that we stay a trustworthy and legitimate police department for all Portlanders.\" He also said Tren de Aragua has a presence in Portland, but it \"does not appear to be as significant as some are led to believe.\"According to Day,  Zambrano-Contreras was previously arrested in the region for prostitution and Nino-Moncada was present when a search warrant was served.It is unclear whether the two are facing any criminal charges related to Thursday's incident, which came one day after an immigration agent shot dead a motorist in Minneapolis. DHS said that driver tried to run the agent over, an account disputed by state officials.  Recently, DHS sent agents to Minneapolis to arrest and deport illegal immigrants, following similar sweeps in Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities. On Thursday night, hundreds of people protested outside an immigration detention centre in Portland. Authorities made six arrests for disorderly conduct. ",

    "description": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers\" who are trying \"to please the president of the US\".",
    "body": "Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers\" who are trying \"to please the president of the US\".Iran also sent sent a letter to the United Nations Security Council blaming the US for turning the protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\" in Iran. Trump, meanwhile, said Iran was \"in big trouble\".The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy. At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups. An internet blackout is in place.\"We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean \"boots on the ground\".\"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,\" he said. These remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.\"Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,\" the 86-year-old said.Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei doubled down, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".Iran's United Nations ambassador accused the US of \"interfering in Iran's internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence,\" in a letter to the Security Council. Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.In a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were \"deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters\".\"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,\" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.Meanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of \"no leniency\" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).Iran's National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said \"decisive and necessary legal action will be taken\" against protesters, which it described as \"armed vandals\" and \"disruptors of peace and security\".In a brief statement, it warned against \"any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities\". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as \"terrorist acts\", asserting that it would continue its operations \"until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan\".Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to \"be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran\". Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.Protests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei.In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.\"It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay,\" she said.The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.Additional reporting by Reha Kansara, Kasra Naji and Soroush Negahdari",

    "body": "'Unprecedented' numbers seeking debt help post-Christmas, say charities8 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesDebt charities say they are receiving an influx of calls as people worry their financial situation has slipped towards becoming unmanageable.The first weeks of January are usually the busiest time of year for helplines following a particularly expensive period.Advice charity StepChange said Monday was busier than any single day last year, and credit counselling service Money Wellness said a fifth of those accessing its services at the turn of the year did so between 22:00 and 03:00.Dave Murphy is working his way out of debt and said demands from creditors could have become overwhelming, but he urged anyone struggling to ensure they asked for help - for their financial and mental wellbeing.Money Wellness, which runs free debt and money advice services, said thousands of people had accessed its services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Expanded assistance online allows people to increasingly find information outside of normal hours - including overnight.Sebrina McCullough, its head of advice, said: \"The numbers we're seeing over Christmas and New Year are unprecedented.\"People often feel pressure to celebrate the holidays, even when money is tight, and our data shows many are turning to us late at night when they feel most anxious.\"Pressure of priority billsStepChange's website had 3,958 visitors on Christmas Day, and 15,401 on New Year's Eve and 1 January combined.Many may have simply been exploring their options, but calls came in thick and fast at the start of the month. While not at the level of the energy crisis of a few years ago, call numbers were notably up on last year.The Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline, said the first working days of January had seen more calls than last year.Monday was the busiest single day in its history, when 1,365 calls came in.Concerns are particularly acute for those struggling to pay priority bills such as council tax and rent.The colder weather could also place extra strain on vulnerable households, with £4.4bn already owed to energy suppliers following a period of high prices, although the government's cold weather payments have been triggered in many areas.Charities are urging anyone whose debt has become unmanageable to seek help as soon as possible, rather than making matters worse by ignoring the situation.That is a view shared by Dave, who has managed to work his way out of difficulty. A few years ago, he found his previously manageable credit card debt becoming a problem when he was unexpectedly made redundant at the same time as going through a divorce.Dave has turned his finances around after receiving help from StepChange\"They were two quite dramatic things in six months,\" said Dave, who has previously spoken to the BBC about his debt issues.\"The debt was around £20,000 to £25,000 at its height. It became so overwhelming. You feel that you are letting creditors down because you want to do what they ask of you - but you are scared, you are renting, and at times you struggle to get through each day.\"Once you are in a spiral, it is really hard to get out of it.\"He is now working in insurance, his debts are manageable and being paid off, and he said he wanted to help others \"to show that you can get through these things\".Figures published earlier in the week by the Bank of England fuelled concerns that everyday costs were becoming harder for some households to manage without turning to borrowing.The data showed that credit card borrowing grew at the fastest annual rate in nearly two years in the run-up to Christmas.The annual growth rate for credit card borrowing increased to 12.1% in November, from 10.9% the previous month - the highest figure since January 2024 when it was 12.5%.",

    "body": "4 days agoAnna LewisBBC Wales Getty ImagesCharlotte Church says her father's \"deep stewardship\" helped her navigate being a child star Charlotte Church has said she \"would be dead\" without the influence of her father, after growing up in the spotlight.The Cardiff-born singer opened up on her close relationship with her father, James Church, in public speaking coach Deborah Thomas's podcast, These Three Things. Church, 39, credited her dad with helping her navigate the \"child star route\", adding: \"It's so arduous and there are so many temptations along the way, and so it would have been so easy for me to have fallen into addiction...\" In the interview, the star said she had a \"lot going on\" and that her father, who has a terminal diagnosis of rare blood disorder amyloidosis, was currently in hospital. During the podcast, which asks guests to share a special person, place and possession which has shaped them, Church said her father was an \"absolutely extraordinary human\" who had been through \"so much\", including battling septicaemia seven times. Describing the start of her career as a child touring with mother Maria, she said: \"We really missed him on the road. My family aren't very traditional in any way at all, and so my father was far more sort of like the nurturing one.\"The singer, who recently appeared on Celebrity Traitors, was just 11 years old when she rose to global fame and earned the moniker the Voice of an Angel.Church said her father joined them on the road after a year and would help take care of her while her mother dealt with the business side of her career, describing him as like \"the hearth\". \"He was sort of worldly and wise enough that he could ground me in a perspective, ground me in the transience of it all, and that it probably wouldn't be forever, and just [try] to say let's enjoy it while it's here.\" Church, who runs a wellness retreat in the Nant Caethon Valley in Powys, said it had been a \"journey\" since her father's terminal diagnosis nearly a decade ago. \"Pretty much every year in those nine years, he's had a near-death experience where it's like something's happened.\"He has really had to tolerate this rollercoaster of health and emotions and everything associated. But it's also a very long time to live with a terminal diagnosis, and so it's massively changed him.\"Speaking about her father's impact on her life, Church added: \"I'm making him a photo album, and I think that'll be very emotional for us to go through. \"But in general, I am able to tell him what he means to me, and how he has massively shaped my life and shaped who I am.\"Without him, I'd be dead.\" More top stories",

    "body": "Elon Musk has said that critics of his social media site X are looking for \"any excuse for censorship\", amid reports that X's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok was creating non-consensual sexualised images of people, including children. Ofcom says it is conducting an urgent assessment of X in response, which has been backed by Technology Secretary Liz Kendall. She described the sexual manipulation of images of women and children as \"despicable and abhorrent\", adding that she would expect to see an update from Ofcom in \"days\".X has now limited the use of AI image function to those who pay a monthly fee, a change dubbed by Downing Street as \"insulting\" to victims of sexual violence.The BBC has seen several examples of the free AI tool undressing women and putting them in sexual situations without their consent.Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk last year seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. \"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today [Friday] to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.\"\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.Kendall has said that Ofcom will have the government's full support if it makes the decision to block X in the UK.The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer calling it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSarah SmithNorth America editorPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. \"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.We will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.In a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\".\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"\"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added.Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.",

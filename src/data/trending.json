    "body": "Abject failure becoming the norm - where does Welsh rugby go from here?Image source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Wales lost three out of four autumn internationals in 2025ByGareth GriffithsBBC Sport WalesPredicting when Welsh rugby has actually hit rock bottom has become quite difficult recently.Each time we think a new low has been reached in the past couple of years, yet another depth is plumbed. Saturday's 73-0 record home humiliation against world champions South Africa is Wales' latest low point.Sitting in the Principality Stadium in March listening to England performing their victory song after inflicting a record 68-14 home defeat on their hosts, one Welsh rugby expert asked \"it can't get worse than this, can it?\"It turns out it can.Eight months on from the England embarrassment, it was the Springboks squad belting out their celebration tune on an autumnal Saturday night in Cardiff.This 11-try demolition was the second worst defeat in Welsh rugby history after the 96-13 hammering dished out by the Springboks in Pretoria in 1998.So where can Welsh rugby go from here?Another annus horribilis for Welsh rugbyDebating whether the England or South Africa loss was more degrading for Welsh rugby seems futile. The same applies when judging whether 2024 or 2025 was the more humbling year for the national men's side. Abject failure is becoming the norm.It is worth revisiting how low Welsh rugby has sunk since the World Cup quarter-final defeat by Argentina in Marseille in October 2023.Since that loss, Wales have been beaten in 20 out of 22 matches in the two calendar years that have followed.In 2024, Wales lost all 11 Test matches, while this year they have suffered nine defeats in 11 games, with the only two victories coming against Japan.While 2025 has actually seen some success of sorts, it is arguably worse than 2024. Wales have twice suffered record home defeats, shipped 50 points at home on four occasions against England, Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa, and had three head coaches in Warren Gatland, Matt Sherratt and Steve Tandy.Wales started the year in January by being 'nilled' in their 43-0 Six Nations defeat by France in Paris. They ended 2025 with another pointless performance against the Springboks. A neat bookend to another traumatic 12 months in Welsh rugby's soap opera.WRU face questions on future reformsImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Dave Reddin has previously worked with England Rugby, Team GB and the England football team\"They say what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.\"Those were the sentiments of Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) president Terry Cobner in his South Africa programme notes.Following the latest capitulation and an 11th home Test defeat in 12 games, Welsh rugby does find itself on life support.The WRU annual general meeting (AGM) will be held on Sunday, less than 24 hours after Welsh rugby's latest humiliation. It could prove a lively affair. This latest shambles against the Springboks might well strengthen the WRU's hand that something has to be done.After the England loss, former Wales captain Gwyn Jones said Welsh rugby bosses should not waste a crisis and must instigate immediate major change.The WRU has since proposed cutting the number of professional sides in Wales from four to three but no clear plan has emerged on how that will happen.Negotiations will continue with Ospreys, Scarlets, Cardiff and Dragons in December, the WRU hoping a decision can be made by consensus before the end of the year.If it is not resolved, the process will go out to tender and that could take six months.So it could still be ongoing in the spring when Wales will be attempting to avoid a third clean sweep of defeats in the Six Nations.The process is being led by WRU director of rugby and head of elite performance Dave Reddin, chair Richard Collier-Keywood and chief executive Abi Tierney, who has only just returned to work after undergoing cancer treatment.The faith in the ability of this trio to instigate and implement change is under scrutiny with question marks over their futures.Reddin was caught on camera smiling while Wales were trailing 59-0 against South Africa.At best, it was unfortunate optics. At worst, people are expressing concerns as to whether Reddin has empathy with the current plight of Welsh rugby and if he really has its interests at heart.Tandy faces case for the defenceImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Steve Tandy left his position as Scotland defence coach to become the new Wales head coach in 2025Reddin's first major job was to appoint Tandy and it has been a baptism of fire in the first campaign for the new head coach.The 45-year-old former Ospreys boss has suffered significant defeats against Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa, alongside a one-point last-gasp win against Japan courtesy of a late Jarrod Evans penalty.While there have been some glimpses of attacking intent, former Scotland and British and Irish Lions defence coach Tandy will be especially concerned with his specialist area.Wales have conceded 27 tries and 200 points in the four November matches where they were constantly overpowered and out-muscled.Tandy will need a renowned defence coach appointed in time for the Six Nations.He also must be given more permanent coaches in his backroom staff to join Sherratt and Danny Wilson.'We must not be in this position again' - LakeMedia caption, Wales 0-73 South Africa: Record home defeat will drive hosts to improve - LakeAfter the South Africa defeat, Wales captain Dewi Lake said his side must not find themselves in that position again.How much damage is being done to young inexperienced Welsh players is also a concern. Not just what they are being exposed to on the international scene but also fears about their own futures. Former Wales fly-half James Hook says the players should not be singled out for criticism.\"It's not the time to pick out individuals or flaws in how we attacked or how we defended,\" Hook told BBC Radio Wales.\"Everybody knows the situation with Welsh rugby at the moment, on and off the field, there's so much uncertainty and that's having an effect on these players.\"The uncertainty as to whether these boys are going to have jobs in the next six months or a year or so is taking its toll.\"'Lambs to the slaughter'Questions have been asked as to why the WRU arranged this fixture in the first place, as it attracted the lowest crowd, just over 50,000, for a match between these two countries in Cardiff since 1999.Wales were forced to field a weakened side minus their 13 England and France-based players with the match falling outside World Rugby's official Test window.Watching the likes of Tomos Williams, Dafydd Jenkins and Louis Rees-Zammit excelling in action for their clubs on the same weekend as their Wales team-mates were being humbled in Cardiff sums up the farcical situation.South Africa also lost players to club duty but were still able to call on a dazzling array of talent, with their bench alone boasting more Test caps than Wales' entire matchday squad.\"This fixture against the world champions was at the end of an autumn campaign which has already been a bit of a struggle,\" said Hook.\"Frankly, it was lambs to the slaughter and it's hard to blame any of those Welsh players.\"The brutal truth is the majority of this Welsh crop of players are currently not up to international standard and are being exposed. They feel the pain of dire defeats more than anybody.So for everybody involved in Welsh rugby - the WRU, players, coaches and supporters - this must now be rock bottom. Surely?",

    "body": "At least four people have been killed in a mass shooting at a child's birthday party in California.Ten others were injured in the shooting at a restaurant on Saturday evening, in the state's northern city of Stockton.Local police say the victims include both adults and children. The conditions of the injured have not been confirmed.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited. \"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the US Supreme Court expanded gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor",

    "body": "34 minutes agoPaulin KolaEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has submitted a request for a pardon to the country's President Isaac Herzog.The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the \"extraordinary request which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies any wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end, but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" the prime minister. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, the president's office released the request and a letter by the prime minister himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial.In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favours.He is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverage.And in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch-hunt\" by political opponents.He said in Sunday's video message that the continuation of the trial \"tears us apart from within\" at a time when Israel was facing \"enormous challenges, and alongside them great opportunities\" that required unity.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president could pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.It was public fears that this was under attack with the government's plans for judicial reforms that brought hundreds of thousands out onto the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 that triggered the most recent Gaza war.",

    "body": "'One of our greatest writers': King leads tributes to Sir Tom Stoppard7 hours agoSeher Asaf,Patrick JacksonandYang TianPlaywright Sir Tom Stoppard dies at 88King Charles III and Queen Camilla have led tributes to famed playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, who died aged 88, hailing him as \"one of our greatest writers\".\"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history,\" they said.Sir Tom, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the screenplay for Shakespeare In Love, \"died peacefully at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family\", his agents said on Saturday.Tributes have poured in from around the world for the playwright who captivated audiences for more than six decades with work that explored philosophical and political themes.The King and Queen added they were \"deeply saddened\" by Sir Tom's death and sent their condolences to his family.\"We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: 'Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else'.\"The line is from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, one of his most notable stage works which also include The Real Thing.Paying tribute to his \"favourite playwright\", Sir Mick Jagger posted on social media: \"He leaves us with a majestic body of intellectual and amusing work. I will always miss him.\"Author Robert Harris, a friend of Sir Tom's, praised his talent and joy for life.\"He lived one of the most enviable lives I can think of. He was immensely talented, he was a very happy man, very witty and he enjoyed life. He came to lunch here in the summer and he was still smoking and indeed he was making notes in the summer for writing,\" the Times reported.Australian-British author of the 1979 novel Puberty Blues, Kathy Lette, remembered Sir Tom as \"one of the wittiest people I ever met\".Sharing a picture of them on social media, she wrote: \"A conversation with him left you reeling from irreverent & imaginative quip-lash.\"Sir Tom received many honours and accolades throughout his career, including being knighted by the late Queen for his services to literature in 1997.He also wrote for film, TV and radio. He adapted Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina for the 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law.In 2020, he released his semi-autobiographical new work titled Leopoldstadt - set in the Jewish quarter of early 20th Century Vienna - which later won him an Olivier award for best new play and scooped four Tony awards.Nicholas Hytner, who directed Stoppard's play The Hard Problem at the National Theatre in London 10 years ago, celebrated the playwright's \"astonishing generosity and curiosity about the work of others\".\"He was a great writer and a legendary host but those of us lucky enough to know him and work with him will remember him as an exceptional enhancer of the lives he touched,\" according to the Guardian.The Olivier Awards organisation, which recognise excellence in theatre, said West End theatres would dim their lights for two minutes at 19:00 BST on 2 December to remember the playwright.In a post on X, it said Sir Tom had won three Olivier Awards and five Tony awards - for Broadway theatre - as well as the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love.\"That recognition attests to the remarkable range and enduring impact of his work on both stage and screen,\" it said.Getty ImagesSir Tom Stoppard (R) with screenwriter Marc Norman hold their Oscars in 1999.Rupert Goold, artistic director of the Almeida Theatre, described Sir Tom as the \"most supportive, most generous man\" whose \"magic was present in everything he wrote\".Born Tomas Straussler in Czechoslovakia, his parents fled from imminent Nazi occupation when he was still a baby and went to Singapore, where his father died in a Japanese prison camp.He, his mother and brother had escaped ahead of the Japanese invasion and went first to Australia, later to India. There his mother met and married an Englishman, a Major Kenneth Stoppard, before moving to England.He later learned from relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish, and that they had died in Nazi concentration camps.\"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life,\" he said in US magazine Talk in 1999, as he reflected on returning to his birthplace Zlin in what is now the Czech Republic.Lyricist Sir Tim Rice said he \"was in awe of nearly everything\" Sir Tom did.\"He was able to mix intellectual arguments and philosophical thought with sheer wit and fun and that was apparent in Rosencrantz And Guildenstern, which was his first big success, and I remained very much in awe of him, but he also became a friend and I was very honoured to know him,\" he told BBC News.\"He's written at least half a dozen, probably twice that, plays that will live for a long, long time - however brilliant plays are, a lot of them don't last much beyond their era, but I think Tom Stoppard's will, no question.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

    "body": "Venezuela has reacted angrily to US President Donald Trump's statement that the airspace around the country should be considered closed.The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\". The US does not have legal authority to close another country's airspace and the Venezuelan statement accused Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\". The US has built its military presence in the area and carried out at least 21 strikes on boats it says were carrying drugs, killing more than 80. It has not provided evidence and Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro says the US moves are an attempt to oust him. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.With Trump ratcheting up his threats, some Democratic and Republican members of the US Congress have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.\"Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer posted on X on Sunday.\"Under our constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said: \"Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.\"Trump's comments come just days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\", leading to several major airlines suspending flights there. Caracas then rescinded their take-off and landing rights.Venezuela's foreign ministry urged \"the international community, the sovereign governments of the world, the UN, and the relevant multilateral organisations to firmly reject this immoral act of aggression\", in a statement on Saturday. The same day, Venezuela's military conducted exercises along coastal areas, with state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being manoeuvred.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment - the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 - is to combat drug trafficking.Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US is to depose the left-wing Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many nations as rigged.Fellow left-wing President Gustavo Petro of Colombia - who has also faced US sanctions - has said he believed the US was using \"violence to dominate\" Latin America, though other leaders in the region have welcomed Trump's stance.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.",

    "body": "Reeves denies she misled public over UK's finances prior to Budget44 minutes agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterandHarry Farley,Political correspondentJeff Overs/BBC/PA WireChancellor Rachel Reeves says she can be trusted with the country's finances and has been \"clear\" about reasons for her decisions, following claims she misled the public in the run-up to her Budget.In an interview for BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Reeves was challenged to explain why she had repeatedly warned about a downgrade to the UK's economic productivity forecasts.It has since emerged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) told her in mid-September the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.When pressed on the issue, she said she did not \"accept\" that it was misleading and said she had remained \"upfront\" about all her plans both in the past week and in the run-up to the general election. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also appearing on the programme, said she was not satisfied with the chancellor's denial and called on her to resign.The Conservatives have accused the Chancellor of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes and Badenoch claimed Reeves had \"lied to the public\".Downing Street has denied she misled the public and Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to back her budget decisions in a speech on Monday, saying the chancellor's decisions will help tackle cost of living pressures and lower inflation.Opening the interview, Kuenssberg asked Reeves whether she could be trusted and the chancellor responded: \"Yes.\"Kuenssberg then outlined what the chancellor had said in a speech on 4 November, when Reeves indicated there was less cash than previously forecast due to a productivity downgrade, and she was likely to need to raise taxes as a result.Reeves explained that, despite what critics were saying, \"I didn't have an extra 4bn to play with\" but instead that the OBR figures had been downgraded from £9.9bn headroom in spring to £4.2bn in the autumn.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"Pushed on whether she had exaggerated the situation in order to pave the way for a £16bn increase in welfare, Reeves said she also had to factor in policy choices made in the previous six months on welfare and the Winter Fuel Allowance.She said: \"I did say when those policies changed just before the summer that we would have to find that money in the Budget, so I was very upfront about that.\"Yes, I did make the decision in the Budget to scrap the two-child [benefit] limit  - that was funded by increases on online gambling taxes and also by cracking down on tax avoidance and tax evasion, fully costed and fully funded, and lifting half a million children out of poverty.\"Asked if she had broken the spirit, if not the letter, of her manifesto commitment on taxation by freezing income tax thresholds, Reeves said: \"I recognise I did not say that in the manifesto but since then we've had both a significant downgrade in the productivity forecast but also huge global turbulence.\"She added: \"I have to respond to all those things because, if I were to lose control of the public  finances, we would be punished.\"Punished by financial markets that hold £2.6tn of public debt, and punished with higher interest rates, which wouldn't affect just the country but would also affect every single business that borrows, and every single family that has a mortgage.\"Appearing on the same show, Badenoch said she was \"absolutely not\" satisfied with Reeves' explanation and she should instead have cut welfare spending. She urged the chancellor to quit.She said: \"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR was telling her the complete opposite. \"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare - the only thing that was unfunded was the welfare payments that she has made, and she's doing it on the backs of a lot of people out there who are working very hard and getting poorer - and because of that I believe she should resign.\"Badenoch added her shadow chancellor Mel Stride has written a letter of complaint to the Financial Conduct Authority asking for an investigation, accusing the chancellor of trying to \"pitchroll for her Budget\", which could constitute \"market manipulation\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "10 minutes agoHafsa KhalilReutersAt least 146 people are known to have died in a devastating fire that tore through multiple high-rise buildings in Hong Kong.Police announced the death toll in a news conference on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". A further 79 are injured and 150 remain missing, they said.Seven of eight tower blocks in a housing in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames on Wednesday. Accusations the fire was helped by flammable materials on the outside of the buildings has sparked anger and concern.Thousands are gathering at the Wang Fuk Court complex on Sunday to mourn the victims, with queues stretching to almost 2km.The death toll has been rising since the fire began, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.Police official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.Indonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.The fire department said the fire reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F). Twelve firefighters were injured battling the blaze.The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.The tower blocks were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction and renovation work in Hong Kong. The fire has sparked a debate about whether it should still be used.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption probe included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. A police spokesperson previously said they have reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent probe into the fire.Ching Sze Yip/BBCChing Sze Yip/BBCAmong the tributes added are handwritten messages for the victims of the fireHundreds of flower bouquets have been laid down as people queue to mourn and pay their respectsThe fire - Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years - led the region's authority to declare a three-day mourning period, which began on Saturday.Officials observed a three minutes' silence to mark the start of the period, while the flags of China and Hong Kong were flown at half-mast.Thousands of people have been visiting the scene to lay down flowers and pray, as well as offer handwritten messages for victims.Indonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" with how many people turned up to pray for the victims.\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.One Filipino worker said they joined the prayers in solidarity, as well as \"to show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died. ",

BRM was founded at the bottom of a garden in the small town of Bourne, Lincolnshire, 80 years ago and went on to win the world title. \"It's an amazing story isn't it?\" says Damon Hill, the former F1 champion and broadcaster. \"They set out to take on the world.\"I think they put this country on the map as a world leader in automotive technology and Formula 1.\"Hulton-Deutsch Collection/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty ImagesBRM driver Graham Hill (right) won the South African Grand Prix in 1962 when Sir Alfred Owen was proprietorHill, the 1996 world champion, has a strong link to BRM. His father, Graham, drove for the team and won the team's only title in 1962.\"It was one of the places that really enabled him to show what he had,\" Hill recalls. \"He built his career on, basically, the success he had at BRM.\"But that success did not come easily. BRM - or British Racing Motors, as it was formally known - was founded by Raymond Mays, an ambitious racer and entrepreneur, in 1945 in the market town of Bourne.Mays and co-founder Peter Berthon built a small factory at the bottom of Mays' garden and set out to take on European teams such as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo.75 years of BRM: Lincolnshire's pioneering F1 teamAnthony Delaine-Smith, who runs a bus company based in Spalding Road, where the former BRM factory once stood, said: \"Raymond Mays always had a hankering to go Grand Prix racing. \"The idea was after the war, they would bring industries together with this idea of building a British Grand Prix car.\"At the time motor racing was recovering after World War Two and in 1950 a new Formula 1 World Championship was launched.BRM developed the Type 15 Chassis Number 1 car, with a V16 supercharged engine, to take part. Anthony Delaine-Smith from Delaine Buses in Bourne which now owns the site where the original BRM factory wasMays brought together about 40 British companies for the project.He managed to get the backing of some of the UK's leading industrialists, including Sir Alfred Owen who would go on to buy the team from Mays.Today, BRM describes the Type 15 as \"arguably Britain's most important Formula 1 car\".Although it was not ready for the first Formula 1 World Championship race, at Silverstone in 1950, the green BRM was soon racing alongside iconic marques such as Ferrari and Maserati.In 1952, the company was given another boost when Juan Manuel Fangio, the leading driver of his era, agreed to drive the car. Maurice Hamilton, the former racing correspondent for BBC Radio 5 Live and The Observer, said: \"To get Juan Manuel Fangio into your car was quite something. \"He really was the man, the up-and-coming man.\"National Motor Museum/Heritage Images/Getty ImageRaymond Mays had a successful racing and hillclimb career between 1921 and 1950Motor racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart, who won three world titles, got his first introduction to F1 while racing with BRM.He said the team was the \"first to undertake huge responsibility\" with \"top-line drivers\".\"Juan Manuel Fangio drove once at BRM and he was the greatest racing driver that's ever lived. So I saw all of that,\" said Stewart, who joined the team in 1965.\"Really, it was a very important part of my life to get the ride with BRM. That was a very big moment in my life. \"The family - first class. And the engineers and the rest of the people were really wonderful.\"Mark Sutton - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty ImagesSir Jackie Stewart was one of the \"top-line drivers\" who raced for BRMHe said the success of BRM paved the way for Britain's huge motor racing industry, which is now worth £12bn a year according to F1.\"BRM started it all in a big way and we are now the capital of the world,\" Stewart added.BRM raced until 1974, winning 17 grands prix, securing 63 podium finishes and claiming the drivers' and constructors' championships in 1962.Mays put the company up for sale in 1952 and it was bought by Sir Alfred Owen and his engineering company Rubery Owen, though Mays stayed on as team manager. He went on to be appointed CBE for services to motor racing in 1978, two years before his death at the age of 80. Rick Hall (left) was a mechanic with BRM and Nick Owen is now custodian of the BRM name along with his familyNick Owen, the grandson of Sir Alfred, is the custodian of the BRM name today, along with brother Paul, cousin Simon and uncle John.He described Bourne as the place \"where everything happened\" from car and engine designs, to tests at nearby Folkingham, which became \"critical to the BRM history\".The team's success paved the way for British teams such as McLaren, Williams and Lotus.Nick Owen said as well as celebrating the team's achievements of the past, BRM wanted to inspire the next generation and \"lay the foundations for the future, for the next 75 years\".Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Hidden well in cathedral crypt shines blue after mosaic transformation3 hours agoPauline McLeanScotland arts correspondentBBCAn ancient well, buried in the sacred crypt of a historic Glasgow church, has been excavated and transformed into a major art project, seen by the public for the first time in living memory.The well has been hidden for centuries in the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral.In October it was uncovered under the lead of archaeologist Prof Stephen Driscoll from the University of Glasgow.It has now been enhanced by a stunning light mosaic and will be the focus of a series of concerts and events to celebrate 850 years of the city of Glasgow.Alasdair SmithThe mosaic colours are designed to represent water and the greens of natureLong before Glasgow became a city, the site of the well marked a place of deep spiritual significance. It is believed to be where St Kentigern, also known as Mungo, established his cell and performed baptisms in the waters of the Molendinar Burn below. The natural well was later incorporated into the walls of Glasgow Cathedral, forming the heart of the Kentigern Shrine in the crypt. Over the centuries, this sacred site grew in prominence, becoming one of Britain's major pilgrimage destinations for more than 300 years. The well not only predates Christianity as a sacred site, but also symbolically and literally marks the starting point of what would become the city of Glasgow.Approxima Arts/Chris LeslieThe excavation involved opening up the well, removing all the coins and draining debris until the water ran clearThe mosaic installation, simply called The Well, has been brought to life by the Aproxima Creative Collective team, including Scottish artist Joanna Kessel.It is made of more than 1,000 handblown coloured glass tiles, each inlaid with gold leaf, echoing the colours of the cathedral's stained-glass windows.She explained how the tiles, made at the Orsoni Venezia 1888 furnace in Italy, were actually used back-to-front to give the colours she wanted.\"I had a lot of these glass plates in my studio and this blue-green is actually the back, the reverse of the gold leaf plates.\"So I thought, well I'll just ask Orsoni to supply us with a range so that we could get this transition from light down to dark at the bottom of the well.\"When I spoke to them they were like, oh Joanna, these are the backs. We don't produce this specifically so the front is what they're working to create and the back in some ways is incidental.\"Joanna went over to Venice to sift through crates and crates of the gold leaf mosaic to find the right colours.Joanna shows the back of the gold-leaf tiles which carried the colours she was looking forThe well is a new attraction for visitors to the cityCreative director Angus Farquhar said the well was a powerful but neglected part of Glasgow's story.  \"I saw that little well in the corner with no signage and it had just been forgotten and I thought wouldn't it be incredible to bring this back as a gift for the people of Glasgow,\" he said.He said that in the past wells had been associated with poisoning and illness and many of the public wells in Glasgow were capped and then forgotten.So excavation of the well was a significant moment.Angus Farquhar's favourite moment of the excavation was seeing the water run clear once moreHe said: \"It had not been touched for 70 years and we found coins from all over the world rings, thimbles, tiny pieces of shell with people's names written on them and we realised that it had still been used as a little point of blessing even though there was no signage there and it was dark.\"That idea that we could bring it back became really exciting and just two weeks ago with the support of Historic Environment Scotland we drained out the last of the water and cleaned the bottom of the well where we'd done the excavation and for the first time probably in one or two centuries the water ran clear again.\"Apart from seeing the mosaic that was my happiest moment in this project, because it felt like we'd brought back something pure.\"Artist Joanna Kessel created the mosaic installationThe re-dedication of the well will be celebrated with musical concerts next weekend.Audiences can also pre-book a timed slot to visit the well and view the new mosaic in the crypt.The project is one of the many events organised in 2025 to celebrate Glasgow's 850th birthday.The Lord Provost of Glasgow, Jacqueline McLaren said: \"This remarkable project not only honours our past but also breathes new life into a site of profound significance in our city's story, blending archaeology, contemporary art, and music in a celebration for all Glaswegians and visitors alike. \"The project will serve as a lasting legacy from Glasgow 850 and one that can also inspire our future.\"",

    "body": "25 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia, with hundreds still missingThe death toll from flooding and landslides on Indonesia's Sumatra island has risen dramatically to 442, officials say.The total passed 300 earlier on Sunday, with evacuation efforts under way, major roads cut off, and internet and electricity only partially restored.Monsoons exacerbated by tropical storms have caused some of the worst flooding in years across South East Asia. Hundreds are dead and missing in Malaysia and Thailand as well, with millions affected across the region.The official death toll in Thailand currently sits at 170, with two deaths reported in Malaysia's northern Perlis state.Elsewhere, there have been nearly 160 deaths in Sri Lanka due to a bout of particularly extreme weather that has caused flooding and mudslides.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsAn exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Indonesia's Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.\"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told news agency Reuters. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.In Tapanuli, the worst-affected area, residents have reportedly ransacked shops in search of food. Pressure is mounting on Jakarta to declare a national disaster in Sumatra to enable a faster and more co-ordinated response.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia, hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 3.8 million people have been affected, the government said on Saturday.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day last week - the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, workers were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that had lost family members. Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of Perlis state underwater, with tens of thousands forced into shelters.Elsewhere in Asia, Sri Lanka has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, with at least 193 people killed and more than 200 missing, according to the Disaster Management Centre.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters of recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto - which has crossed over the Philippines and is now heading towards Vietnam - and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.Three people have already been killed and another is missing in Vietnam due to the effects of the approaching Typhoon Koto, news agency AFP reports.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.While it is hard to link individual extreme weather events to climate change, scientists say it is making storms more frequent and intense, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.More on this story",

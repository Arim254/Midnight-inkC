    "body": "'The second home ban has breathed new life into my village' 15 hours agoJo LonsdaleBBC North East and Cumbria InvestigationsBBCMany generations of Jennifer Hall's family fished out of a now largely empty Beadnell Harbour Nearly eight years ago, Beadnell on the Northumberland coast became one of the first villages in the country to ban any homes built on new sites being used as second homes or holiday lets. The number of permanent residents has increased, bringing what some say is \"new life\" but others argue the policy is not enough to save rural communities or think it an unwarranted attack on tourism.Driving towards Beadnell harbour, 75-year-old Jennifer Hall nods one by one at the large houses overlooking the sea.\"Holiday let, second home, second home, holiday let, second home, holiday let,\" she intones. Clustered barnacle-like at the end of a glorious arc of sand, Beadnell, along with the neighbouring villages of Bamburgh and Seahouses, has long been a magnet for those seeking refuge from the madding crowd. According to the 2021 census, 64% of homes in Beadnell are second homes or holiday lets, up from 55% in 2011.Almost every house on Beadnell seafront is a holiday let or second homeHall's family has been in Beadnell since at least the 1700s. \"Fishing folk mainly,\" she says, but her great-grandmother opened the village's first hotel, an irony not lost on her given her years-long campaign against over-reliance on tourism. \"I don't hate holiday lets and I don't hate second homes at all,\" she says.\"But, in winter when there are no lights on, it can be very lonely.\" For much of the last half century, planning policy encouraged tourism. As recently as 2016, a new estate of 40 houses, Bernicia Way, was completed with a legal condition they could only be used as second homes or holiday lets. \"We were thinking there would come a point when there was nobody living here at all,\" Hall says.Among its policies was a requirement that all homes built on new sites would come with a legal restriction that they could only be used as a permanent residence. Planning policies previously supported tourism so the 40 homes in Bernicia Way, completed in 2016, can only be used as holiday lets or second homesAn estate of 45 houses called The Kilns was built and it included nine homes designated \"affordable\" - available for a set amount below market rate. The policy has been positive, Hall says, with the number of residents \"up by more than 10%\". \"It's really brought new life,\" she says. \"We have several new clubs in the village, and a fantastic new playground.\" Homes on The Kilns estate can only be lived in as permanent residencesAmong the newcomers to The Kilns determined to get \"stuck in\" to village life are Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes, both in their mid-sixties.They host a new monthly wine club, have joined Beadnell volunteers and Priestley-Jayes has begun a book club.  Jayes is also on the parish council \"for my sins\", he says with a wry smile. \"There's so much going on,\" his wife adds.Jacolyn Priestley-Jayes and Tim Jayes have begun a book club and a wine clubHall accepts the policy is \"not perfect\". Some houses in The Kilns remain unsold, and rumours abound that a few are being used as second homes despite the legal restriction.\"There are definitely some people who don't appear to be using their houses as their permanent residence, which is a shame,\" Priestley-Jayes says. Northumberland Estates, which was behind the project, said responsibility for enforcing the planning condition rests with Northumberland County Council and pointed out the residency requirement was \"very clearly communicated throughout the sales and marketing process\". The council said it would be inappropriate to comment further as the situation was \"part of an active investigation\".Getty ImagesBeadnell, NorthumbriaA further problem is the policy only applies to new sites.\"We've had developers buy up an old house, knock it down and replace it with a bigger property which has become holiday lets,\" Hall says. \"So that's a frustration.\"We've built The Kilns but there's not much space for more new houses.\" The parish council made a map using red and orange dots for holiday homes to demontrate how they dominate BeadnellDespite this, other villages have followed Beadnell in adopting the same policy. Helen Coyne, 72, has a flat in one of them, Alnmouth, with panoramic, ever-changing views of another of Northumberland's seemingly endless beaches. Although this is her second home, she says she understands the rationale behind the changes, and accepts the doubling of council tax since April last year. But she thinks second home owners contribute a lot to local businesses. \"We're here at least two or three nights every week, I use the lovely gift shop, we go out for meals, we drink in the pubs,\" she says.\"When family and friends stay, they do that even more.\"Helen Coyne, who has a holiday home in Alnmouth, says she tries hard to support local businessesBut Tim Farron, the MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria, says some second home owners visit \"just a couple of times a year\". \"They're definitely not sending their children to local schools either,\" he adds. The Liberal Democrat's constituency includes part of the Lake District National Park where one in four properties is a holiday home.Farron wants to go even further than applying restrictions to new-builds and is advocating a change in planning law.\"If I wanted to change my house into a fish and chip shop, I'd have to apply for planning permission,\" he says. \"But if I want to turn it into a second home or a holiday let, I can just do that. But it has a material impact on the community I live in.\"He wants separate categories of planning use for holiday lets and second homes, which would allow local authorities to limit their numbers.\"That way we can ensure rural communities don't die.\" The Lake District National Park Authority hopes to build affordable homes available only as a principal residenceThe Lake District National Park Authority's head of development management, Andrew Smith, agrees the current tools it has are \"quite limited\" and school populations continue to decline.The authority has set a target for 1,200 new permanent homes by 2035 but has no control over what happens to the existing housing stock.\"All you can do is approve or refuse new houses and try and facilitate new housing coming forward,\" he says. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it knew \"too many second homes and holiday lets can be harmful for communities\" and was taking action.Councils had the power to charge more council tax for second homes and the ministry was \"removing the incentive for landlords to prioritise short-term holiday lets over longer-term homes\", a spokesperson said.\"We'll continue to monitor impacts on communities and consider more powers for councils where needed,\" they added.PATourism revenue for the Lake District in 2024 was £2.3bnHowever, Richard Sayer, a former director of the North-East estate agents Rook Matthews Sayer, is wary of anything that might reduce the number of visitors.  \"An elderly person living permanently in a village has a perfect right to be there but is not hiring paddleboards and kayaks, or going to restaurants,\" he says.\"A holiday let with six people, they're spending thousands every week which is all going into the local economy.\"He has a holiday property near Keswick in Cumbria and thinks the doubling of council tax on second homes is already causing some to sell up. \"What is really needed is accommodation for the staff who work in the tourist industry, not fewer holiday homes,\" he adds. \"Every business in Keswick seems to have a sign up saying they are looking for staff.\"PAMore than half the properties in the Northumberland village of Bamburgh are second homes or holiday lets Back in Beadnell, on the kind of grey blustery day when the rain pecks at your face, the Craster Arms has a steady stream of windbent visitors. Owner Michael Dawson, who employs about a hundred staff across three cafes and pubs - \"young people, local people\" - also has little time for policies which deter second homes and holiday lets. \"The gift shops, ice-cream parlours, fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants,\" he says\"Make no mistake, we all rely on them.\"  Publican Michael Dawson would like to see even more holiday lets and second homes in Beadnell What everyone agrees on is rural communities need more young families amid falling birth rates and an ageing population.    There are about 750 properties in Beadnell but no school and only about 20 children. Esther Graham, 46, grew up in the village but could only afford to live there with her children by moving in with her parents, who extended their home to accommodate. \"There's nothing for the kids, no clubs, no brownies or scouts,\" she says.Like Hall, her family have been in Beadnell for centuries but she worries about future generations. \"What we need more than anything is affordable housing and more jobs,\" she says. Esther GrahamEsther Graham grew up in Beadnell but says she can only afford to live there because she shares a house with her parentsNorthumberland County Council said the provision of affordable housing was one of its \"top priorities\" and it had updated its Housing Allocation Policy so council houses were only offered to people with \"a very strong connection to Northumberland\". It said, between 2017 and the end of 2025, more than 1,700 affordable homes had been built across the county and planning permission had been granted for 1,369 more.Related internet linksRelated stories",

    "body": "Met apologises to Lord Speaker after Mandelson tip-off error5 hours agoRichard Wheeler,Political reporterandLucy Manning,Special correspondentUK Parliament/PALord Forsyth said it was \"entirely false\" to suggest he was the source of the police tip-offThe Metropolitan Police has apologised to the Speaker of the House of Lords after he was incorrectly identified as the source of information relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest.Officers met Lord Forsyth earlier on Thursday after he requested urgent talks to understand how his name came to be mentioned.Lord Mandelson's lawyers said police officers arrested the former ambassador to the US at his London home on Monday because of a \"baseless\" suggestion he was planning to \"take up permanent residence abroad\".Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle on Wednesday confirmed he had passed on information to the force suggesting Lord Mandelson could be a flight risk.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's lawyers were twice told by the police that information about his alleged travel plans had been passed on by Lord Forsyth.On Tuesday evening, the Lord Speaker denied any involvement after he was initially reported as the source of the referral.He called the suggestion \"entirely false and without foundation\".On Wednesday, Sir Lindsay told MPs that he had given \"relevant\" information to police and he had done this \"in good faith\", considering it to be his \"duty and responsibility\".He did not provide any details, but the BBC understands Sir Lindsay passed on information he received in the British Virgin Islands during a visit last week that Lord Mandelson was planning to travel there.The Met apologised on Wednesday to Sir Lindsay for \"inadvertently revealing\" he was the source of information relating to Lord Mandelson's arrest.After Lord Forsyth met officers on Thursday, the force said in a statement: \"The Met has also apologised to the Speaker of the House of Lords, following the inadvertent revealing of information into allegations of misconduct in public office.\"The Met launched an investigation earlier this month over allegations that Lord Mandelson, while he was serving as a minister, had passed on market-sensitive government information to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The BBC understands that Lord Mandelson's position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. Lawyers for the peer said he intends to co-operate with police to \"clear his name\".Lord Mandelson was taken to Wandsworth police station in London for interview, before later being released on bail pending further investigation. It is understood he surrendered his passport as one of his bail conditions.Lord Mandelson became the British ambassador to the US in February 2025.He was sacked in September after Downing Street said new information about the depth of his relationship with Epstein had emerged.The allegations against Lord Mandelson emerged after the US Department of Justice released a tranche of documents last month, including emails between him and Epstein.

    "body": "3 hours agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterEPA/ShutterstockJeremy Corbyn helped launch Your Party in 2025 with Zarah SultanaJeremy Corbyn is expected to become the parliamentary leader of Your Party after his supporters won control of the left-wing party's leadership committee.The former Labour leader's supporters, dubbed \"The Many\", won 14 of the 24 seats on the party's central executive committee (CEC) compared to seven seats for \"Grassroots Left\" supporters endorsed by former Labour MP Zarah Sultana.Corbyn said party members had voted for a \"mass, socialist party that takes the fight\" to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.Grassroots Left said Your Party must \"work together to become a party of and for the whole left, with no more witch-hunts or stitch-ups\".\"The Many\" stated that they would elect Corbyn as parliamentary leader if they won the CEC election.Your Party members previously chose to adopt a collective leadership model rather than a single leader, which avoided a direct leadership contest between Corbyn and Sultana.The two MPs launched the party last year to \"take on the rich and powerful\".Both Corbyn and Sultana were elected to the CEC.Corbyn, in a statement released after the results were announced, said: \"We have a precious opportunity to unite our movement around a bold vision for this country - one that believes in a more caring, equal and peaceful society for all.\"I look forward to working with all members to make this vision a reality.\"The Islington North MP said he wanted to \"build a positive and inclusive party where all members feel empowered to share their ideas\".In November, Your Party's conference approved allowing members to have dual membership in future.Coventry South MP Sultana did not attend the opening day of the conference in protest of the expulsion of some members who had retained their membership of other left-wing groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party.Grassroots Left, responding to the election results, said: \"All those who have been expelled should be reinstated. \"We now need a culture of mutual respect, open debate, and a shared focus on the real issues facing us: inequality, insecure work, crumbling public services, fascism, and a political establishment that keeps letting working people down.\"Sultana said members have sent a \"clear message\", including about the need for \"greater transparency and accountability\" and for party branches to be \"properly recognised and respected\".She said \"now is the time to work together\", adding: \"I remain committed to building a socialist, anti-imperialist, anti-Zionist party that is democratic, member-led, and focused on delivering real material change for our communities.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaulin KolaEPATrump's plans to seize control of Greenland have dominated Danish politicsDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has announced early elections - hailing the next four years as \"decisive\" for her country.\"We as Danes and as Europeans will really have to stand on our own feet,\" Frederiksen told parliament. \"We need to define our relationship with the United States,\" she added. The past few months of Danish politics have been dominated by US President Donald Trump's threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Last month, Trump dropped threats to use force against the fellow Nato ally to seize the Arctic island he argues is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China.Announcing the decision to call early elections on 24 March, Prime Minister Frederiksen told parliament that security \"is and will remain the very foundation of Danish politics for many, many years to come\". \"We must rearm to ensure peace on our continent,\" she said. \"We must stick together in Europe, and we must secure the future of the Danish Commonwealth\" - Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.\"Whether I will continue to be your prime minister depends on how strong a mandate you give the Social Democrats,\" Frederiksen said mentioning her party, the lead partner in the current Danish coalition. Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has not abandoned his plans - he has said previously that the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it - and talks continue over ways of establishing US control over the entire island. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty to the US. Their European allies have rallied to their support.The latest confrontation may come in the next few days if Trump follows through with an announcement that the US plans to send a boat filled with medical supplies to Greenland, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\". Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen rejected the proposal, telling Trump that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul GlynnCulture reporter\"I could cry now\": Tracey Emin reacts to famous My Bed sculpture over 20 years onDame Tracey Emin has said her controversial 1999 Turner Prize nominated artwork, My Bed, would be \"tidy\", \"clean\" and \"boring\" if she made it today.The sculpure, depicting a dirty, disheveled and debaucherous bedroom scene - complete with cigarettes, alcohol, underwear and condoms - caused a stir when it was first shown at London's Tate Gallery, almost 30 years ago.It was sold at auction by Christie's in 2014 for more than £2.5m, but has now been loaned back to Tate Modern for its new retrospective, Tracey Emin: A Second Life.The Londoner, 62, told the BBC the bed would be \"ridiculousy tidy\" if she made it again today, and the sheets would have a \"1600 thread count\" - a mark of high quality.Dame Tracy Emin's 1998 artwork, My Bed, is back on display at Tate Modern as part of a career retrospective which opens on FridayAsked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, on her Sunday TV show, what would be next to the bed nowadays, the artist replied: \"My two cats, maybe a few love letters.\"And it would be ridiculously clean, with very, very beautiful sheets, very clean and very tidy.\"It would be so boring, actually.\"Luxurious bedsheets, a reflective Dame Tracey told Kuenssberg, is her \"reward\" for having lived through a much messier youth and young womanhood.'Disgusted and repulsed'Dame Tracey rose to fame in the 1990s as one of the Young British Artists (YBAs), alongside the likes of Damian Hirst and Sarah Lucas.They became known for their entrepreneurial spirit and bold use of unconventional materials, with some at the time saying they used \"shock tactics\" to create their art. My Bed, which was inspired by a sexual yet depressive phase in Dame Tracey's life, was much criticised at the time for featuring stained sheets, soiled knickers and used condoms, as well as empty vodka bottles and cigarette butts.But the artist re-stressed this week that it had, in fact, saved her life.She revealed she had been moved to tears by seeing it back on display.\"I think it's because I nearly lost my life in that bed,\" she said. \"That bed kept me alive. It's not an affectation, it's a real thing.\"When I got up from that bed and looked at it, what I saw, I was disgusted and repulsed at the fact that I'd been laying in it and then I realised that I shouldn't be because it had been holding me and keeping me alive.\"Dame Tracey would tell her younger self not to smokeNearly two years on, Dame Tracey told the BBC she still has the \"rebel\" in her, but that being a dame means she also now has \"a louder voice\".She spoke of her regrets around smoking, and feels as though she has \"a duty\" to speak out, as her works goes on display.\"The first thing I'd say to my younger self, when I was 13 and I took the first draw on that cigarette: 'Put it out and never do it again'.\"She added: \"I've feel now a duty to say a lot of things out loud, a lot, and to be fearless about it as well, because I think when you face death like that... you're told that you've possibly got six months to live, you start thinking about your life.\"Cigarettes after sexHer new show finds the artist reminiscing about \"what you would have done differently, what you regret\" and, she added, what you would do differently \"if you had another chance\".Her other main regret in life is the \"amount of sex\" she had, both as \"a child and as a teenager\", with older men, which she said was \"really bad\".She hopes her work tackles topics like child abuse, abortion and suicide in a non-judgemental manner\"If I'm talking about being abused as a child, if I talk sexually, if I'm talking about being [sic] teenage sex with older men - now it's called grooming, right? It wasn't when I was 14...\"If I'm talking about suicide, if I'm talking about depression, all of the abortion, all of these issues that I make work about are really relevant and really important.\"Dame Tracey said she's now feels \"hideously drunk\" when painting late at night or in the early hours of the morning, having previously felt \"too guilty to paint\" when she was younger.In a broad-ranging interview, the south Londoner - whose dad was a Turkish Cypriot - also spoke about immigration, the NHS and how, in her opinion, the UK has ended up in \"in a mess\", politically speaking.While she doesn't believe AI will take her job as an artist, she said she thinks it is undermining truth in socety.She wants there to be more \"respect and regard\" for the arts because, she said, \"being creative and making art is a beautiful thing\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesBritish travellers to Gibraltar would have to show their passports to Spanish border guards, under a deal with the EU to remove checks at its land border with Spain.The agreement is designed to bring certainty to the British overseas territory nearly a decade after the Brexit vote threw its status into doubt.Pressure to reach a deal had been mounting ahead of the full application of new checks on passengers entering the passport-free Schengen zone in April.Under the deal, Gibraltar will not officially join the zone, made up of 29 mainly EU countries including Spain.Instead, Spanish authorities will carry out \"second line\" Schengen-style border checks in a special zone, after border checks conducted by Gibraltarian officials.Spanish guards will have powers to arrest, search and interview travellers \"where it is justified in the course of border control,\" according to the treaty.The system should eventually allow for the removal of 'La Verja', the 1.2km (0.7 mile) chain link fence along Gibraltar's land border with Spain, which is crossed every day by around half of the Rock's workforce.It would mean the disappearance of \"the last wall in continental Europe,\" said Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares in a video clip welcoming the deal.The UK government is likening the new system to that in operation at London's St Pancras station, where Eurostar passengers are checked by both British and French border officials.British nationals make up a huge share of visitors travelling to Gibraltar for tourism, representing 86.5% of all departures from its airport in 2024, according to the territory's most recent tourism survey. 'Operational overreach'Since Brexit, Spain has allowed Gibraltar residents to cross the border without having their passports stamped, but there have been periodic complaints from Gibraltar about Spanish police tightening checks.From April, Spain had been due to apply the EU's new automated border system, including biometric checks, at the border with Gibraltar, which the UK says would \"devastate\" Gibraltar's economy.Fabian Picardo, the territory's chief minister, has welcomed the agreement, adding it delivers \"the certainty our people and businesses need\".Gibraltar's government says it is hoping to provisionally apply the deal from 10 April, the date when the EU's new border system is scheduled to become fully operational after several previous setbacks.Speaking in the Commons, Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said the deal was evidence of a \"new era of co-operation\" with the EU since Labour took office.His Conservative shadow Wendy Morton said the treaty required \"proper scrutiny\" and questioned how \"operational overreach\" from Spanish police could be avoided. The government also says a majority of goods destined for Gibraltar will be cleared by EU customs offices in Spain, in a deal designed to avoid the need for customs checks at the land border.As part of the deal, the UK and EU have agreed to make unspecified financial contributions towards a new fund to promote \"training and employment\" in the Spanish regions surrounding the territory.Gibraltar was not covered by the UK's 2021 trade deal with the EU, and the UK has previously described it as the \"last piece of the EU exit jigsaw\". The treaty implements a political deal agreed between the UK and EU in June last year, and confirms key details of how the new arrangements will work in practice. It has been published in draft form whilst legal teams complete final reviews and translation of the text. It will have to be ratified by both the UK and European Parliaments. ",

    "body": "32 minutes agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandThomas MackintoshPA MediaIan Huntley is serving a life sentence for the murders of the two schoolgirlsSoham double murderer Ian Huntley is in a serious condition after being attacked in prison, the BBC understands.The 52-year-old is serving a life sentence after he was convicted of murdering schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in August 2002.Although the Prison Service did not confirm the identity of the injured prisoner, it said an inmate at HMP Frankland, a high-security facility in County Durham, was receiving treatment.\"It would be inappropriate to comment further while police investigate,\" a spokesperson added.It is understood the attack on Huntley happened in a prison workshop just before 09:30 GMT.The Sun newspaper, which first reported the attack, said Huntley was beaten with a metal pole by another inmate. An air ambulance was dispatched to HMP Frankland, but the North East Ambulance Service spokesperson said the injured inmate was taken to hospital by road.Durham Constabulary confirmed a police investigation is under way and that detectives are liaising with staff at the prison.\"Police were alerted to an assault which had taken place within HMP Frankland in Durham this morning,\" a Durham police spokesman said.\"A male prisoner suffered serious injuries during the incident and was transported to hospital.\"The deaths of 10-year-olds Jessica and Holly in the quiet Cambridgeshire town of Soham on 4 August 2002 shocked the country.PA MediaHolly Wells (left) and Jessica Chapman went missing on 4 August 2002 in Soham, CambridgeshireHuntley - originally from Grimsby - enticed both schoolgirls into his home and murdered them, before dumping their bodies in a ditch some 12 miles away.Suspicions were raised about Huntley after he gave detailed interviews to the media about Holly and Jessica.Two weeks after they disappeared, Holly and Jessica's bodies were found in a ditch near an air base in Lakenheath, Suffolk.Huntley, who was a caretaker at Soham Village College, was arrested and charged with their murders.During his trial at the Old Bailey, prosecutor Richard Latham QC described Huntley as \"ruthless\" and said Huntley's account of both deaths were \"desperate lies\".However, he admitted he had killed Jessica by putting his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming and that he had told lies to police to cover his tracks. Huntley also admitted dumping the girls' bodies in the ditch and trying to burn them.Huntley was convicted on 17 December 2003 following a trial at the Old Bailey. His girlfriend Maxine Carr, a teaching assistant at the girls' primary school, was also jailed in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.She was freed from jail and given a new identity in May 2004.After his arrest, it emerged Huntley - now aged 52 - had been able to work with children despite being the subject of rape and sexual assault complaints.Huntley had been the subject of a series of complaints made to police in Humberside, where he had worked before.A subsequent inquiry led to criminal checks on anyone working with children.It is not the first time Huntley has been injured while serving time in prison.In 2008 Huntley was moved to HMP Frankland, a Category A high security men's prison.",

As part two of season four lands, actors from the sparkling regency drama tell BBC Newsbeat it's been \"so special\" to be part of the cast.\"When I saw they were casting a whole family of East Asians it was like, 'that's crazy',\" says Isabella Wei, who plays Posy Li. \"I remember the feeling was really like: 'It's our time'.\" The new episodes see Posy and her sister Rosamund burst on to the scene with their formidable mother, Lady Araminta Gun, depicted by Harry Potter actor Katie Leung. NetflixSophie Baek (left) plays the romantic lead in season fourLeading the fourth season's fairy tale-inspired storyline is Benedict Bridgerton, played by Luke Thompson. The Bohemian second son has so far refused to settle down, but this all changes when he meets a masked lady in silver at a masquerade ball. The mysterious love interest turns out not, in fact, to be his heart's desire from society, but a maid called Sophie Baek.With viewers set to find out if the pair's simmering forbidden love can conquer all, Australian actress Yerin Ha, who plays Sophie, tells Newsbeat that representing her community is all she's \"ever wanted\". \"I've gone on a big journey to come back here and to be representing the East Asian community,\" she says. Sydney-born Ha previously said she resonates with challenges that Sophie faces, such as feeling like an outsider. \"I keep wanting to push the needle forward, so it's not a topic of conversation any more,\" she adds.PA MediaLuke Thompson and Yerin Ha attended the screening of Bridgerton season four, part two at London's Southbank on February 24For Katie Leung, who shot to fame as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter films, returning to the screen in a lead role as part of an East Asian family is not a path she saw herself taking. \"I definitely didn't think I would be here, Harry Potter was such a rare opportunity,\" says Katie. \"I always just felt like I never deserved it. Whereas I feel like I deserve it now, because I've worked hard to be here.\"Bridgerton, which is based on a series of novels, has been criticised for casting diverse actors whose background differs from characters in the books.For Isabella Wei, who plays Leung's on-screen daughter Posy Li, being in the show has been an \"amazing opportunity.\"\"All of us worked really hard to be here and put in the work on the show and it was just so special to be in a room with everyone who looked like you,\" says Wei. \"You get to spend so much time together on this glamorous British regency show where you're not meant to be there, and we are, and that is such a beautiful thing.\"NetflixMatchmaking mayhem returns in season four of BridgertonAs each Bridgerton season focuses on a new sibling, it's Thompson's turn to carry the storyline, but the heat isn't getting to him.\"I've had the time to sort of chill out,\" Thompson jokes. \"I didn't feel pressure because I feel like I had started building something in season one, and now we get to develop it,\" he says. In addition to breaking barriers of representation, Bridgerton is known for its gripping storylines - and fans will be waiting with bated breath to find out what becomes of Francesca Bridgerton and Michaela Stirling's romance.In season three Francesca wed John Stirling, played by Victor Alli, and the pair looked to live out a quiet marriage. However, after John introduces his wife Francesca to his cousin Michaela, played by Masali Baduza, a connection begins to grow between the pair.Netflix has confirmed that the pair will be involved in a romance - a twist Baduza admits came with a certain amount of pressure.\"But I am so honoured that I've been trusted to play Michaela,\" she says. \"I think she's such an important character, not only to me, but to a lot of young queer black women and queer people in general.\"I love feeling that people are happy seeing themselves represented on screen. \"I think that love comes in all shapes and sizes and everyone deserves to see their life reflected back to them.\"Bridgerton season four, part two, is available to stream on Netflix.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Calocane was a student at the University of Nottingham when he experienced his first episode of psychosis in May 2020, the inquiry has heard. On the night of 24 May, he broke into a woman's flat in Brook Court, Radford, in the city.The 22-year-old woman, who gave evidence anonymously through an Italian interpreter, said she had moved to Nottingham from Italy in January 2020 and was working as a cleaner at the time. HandoutCalocane was arrested after attempted break-insShe told the inquiry she had returned home from work at 20:00 BST and was showering when she heard repeated knocking at the door. \"I saw that this knocking was becoming louder and louder with kicks so I asked who it is,\" she said.\"The person replied 'it's me, open, open'.\"At first this was said quietly but then it became louder and the person on the other side asked, insisted on asking, to open the door and that's when I panicked.\"Before she could use the spyhole in the door to find out who was there, the woman said the door began to shake. \"I could see the door was shaking, I could feel it was coming off,\" she said. Nottinghamshire PoliceCalocane is serving a hospital order after pleading guilty to three counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and three counts of attempted murderThe woman said she put on her pyjamas and leaned out of the window to call for help, but she said - due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown - nobody was there. \"I thought that someone wanted to hurt me. I didn't know what to do. I was by myself. I was alone. I felt like someone was going to hurt me.\"First, I was holding on to the window and I tried to jump when I slipped and fell on to the ground. I was scared, I was very scared,\" she said. The woman suffered serious back injuries when she fell 10ft to 12ft, and was unable to talk or move, she said. In her statement to the inquiry, the woman said when Calocane was brought into the courtyard of the complex by police, he tried to run towards her.\"He was looking at me with his eyes wide open and he tried to come to me but the officers had pinned him down,\" she said. Recalling giving a statement to police in hospital, the woman said: \"I was very worried. I was angry.\"Also I thought what was going to happen with the person who had tried to attack me, how was this going to end?\"Nottinghamshire PoliceCalocane carried out deadly attacks across Nottingham in 2023Following her surgery and subsequent discharge from hospital, the woman said she was visited by an officer, who told her Calocane could not be prosecuted. \"They said they tried doing anything they could but because of his mental health problem - they mentioned schizophrenia - this person could not be jailed and he was therefore taken to a mental health institution.\"I was very angry, I was very upset because the damage he had caused is going to be forever, and I was so young, and I thought this was not enough.\"The psychiatric hospital was not enough but because there were no other possibilities, I accepted it,\" she said. At the time, Calocane had not been given a formal diagnosis for his mental health issues. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia prior to carrying out his deadly attacks.The inquiry heard Calocane had attempted to force entry into another flat at the same complex - where he believed his mother was - in the early hours that day. He was arrested at the time but released from custody back to Brook Court later the same day. Custody notes, which were shown to the hearing, detailed Calocane's demeanour saying he had been talking about \"seeing the devil\". No further action was taken in relation to the incident in the early hours. In evidence, Insp Katie Eustace, of Nottinghamshire Police, admitted the incident was not \"given the attention it deserved\". The inquiry continues.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "10 hours agoBenjamin RussellBBC ScotlandJames MuirheadJames Muirhead is the games developer behind Grease Trap '99It might not seem like the most likely inspiration for a horror video game, but James Muirhead says working in a Scottish fish and chip shop provided the perfect setting for his latest creation.\"I wanted a culturally Scottish place, and the most Scottish cultural place I could think of was a fish and chip shop,\" he said. \"I also worked in a fish and chip shop myself in Perth before I worked in the games industry. It was the job I had straight after university.\"The 28-year-old has just been awarded £10,000 in funding by Creative Scotland to help create Grease Trap '99, a video game with Gaelic dialogue where players try to fulfil customer orders while a monster is growing in the basement. \"Some creepy things start happening inside the chip shop while they're working,\" James said. \"The monster itself is very Cthulhu-esque seaside horror - octopussy, tentacles, slimy, gross - that kind of thing.\"James MuirheadPlayers will have to juggle customer service with increasingly nefarious goings-onJames said living in the East Neuk of Fife had also influenced the game's premise of a \"spooky mystery happening in this small sedate seaside town\".The game's aesthetic, which is inspired by early PlayStation one graphics, also added to the \"uncanniness\" of the experience. He added: \"The homely comfy environment like a chip shop that people are familiar with, and nostalgic old-school graphics really helps lean into an uncanny dreamlike feeling.\"Although the monster may not have been taken from his own chip shop experience, parts of his old job have made it into the new game.\"The menu is very inspired by the menu of the chip shop I used to work in,\" he said. \"I don't think I fried a single Mars Bar when I worked in a chip shop, I feel like that's more for the tourists, but the thing that shocked me that a lot of people get is the pizza crunch - the supermarket pizza that's folded up, battered and deep fried.\"That will definitely be making an appearance, as well as scraps - the small bits of batter that flake off things and float in the fryer, and then you fish them out and then serve them on top of the chips.\"Although the chippy can be claimed by all constituent countries of the UK, James said the game draws on the specifics of the experience in Scotland, adding that when he lived in England, he was surprised to see there were some stark differences.James MuirheadGrease Trap '99 is set in a small town chippy where all is not as it seems\"They don't even have the Scottish system of a single - which is like the individually fried item and then the supper which is the item plus chips,\" he said. \"It's chaos down there, they've got kebabs and pizzas in the fish and chip shops, which is insane. \"We're pioneers in the systemic ordering of chip shop menus, which is actually quite handy when you're making a game, because it's this easy to use system where it's just like, 'this plus this', add different scriptable objects - it all comes together very nicely when you're programming it.\"James said he was inspired to have the dialogue in his game in Gaelic after playing a small indie horror game called Sauna 2000, which uses the Finnish language and tasks players with heating a sauna.\"I came out of it with this appreciation for Finnish culture and the Finnish language that I didn't have before, and it just sort of seeped into my subconscious and I thought, 'wow, it would be great to do something like that for Gaelic',\" James said.He is now learning Gaelic specifically to help with creating the game - something the money from Creative Scotland would help with.James MuirheadJames says the menu items in the game have been inspired by his own chip shop experience\"The funding is completely game-changing. It means I can work on it full time. I don't have to worry about bills as much which is great, but it also means I can start taking Gaelic classes in person. \"I've just been learning with apps and stuff now I can actually go to in person Gaelic classes. It also means I can work with contractors and other artists and I can compensate them.\"As well as working on developing the game, he is also trying to promote it on social media and by getting it into games festivals with a view to having a version available to play by the summer.\"Making a game is a labour of love - and it's going to be. It's gonna be intense,\" he said.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNardine SaadLos AngelesGetty ImagesD4vd has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the caseNewly unsealed court filings have revealed that US singer D4vd - real name David Anthony Burke - is the target of a grand jury investigation into the apparent murder of a 14-year-old girl, whose remains were found in his car in September.The filings were released after D4vd's family were summoned by a California court to testify before the grand jury.Dawud Burke, D4vd's father, fought against the summons in a Texas court, and in doing so included portions of material from the California case that had not been previously available to the public.The filings confirm that D4vd has been identified as a \"target\" of a grand jury investigation in Los Angeles and that he may be subject to proceedings for one count of murder.He has not been charged or officially named as a suspect in the case and an indictment has not been announced. Grand jury proceedings remain ongoing, according to US media. D4vd has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A lawyer for the singer did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.Warning - this story contains content that some may find distressingThe unsealed court filings mark the latest chapter in a case which has been dissected by internet sleuths for months.On 8 September 2025, investigators found the decomposed head and torso of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez in a cadaver bag in the front boot of a Tesla car registered to D4vd's address in Texas, the court documents said.When they removed the bag, they discovered severed arms and legs in a black bag, the documents said.D4vd - who released his debut album in April - was on tour when the remains were discovered.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesCeleste Rivas Hernandez, of Lake Elsinore, California, was reported missing before she was found dead and dismemberedPolice had previously said that they discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded car after responding to reports of a foul odour at the Hollywood tow yard.Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner. The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators have said.A police spokesperson previously said that the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division.As the grand jury proceedings got under way last year, the court filings said that prosecutors believed the testimony of D4vd's family was \"material and necessary\" to the investigation. But Dawud Burke, along with his wife Colleen and son Caleb, have argued that the summons violates their right to due process because the notice they received from the California court contained redacted information, according to Texas court transcripts included in the filings.\"The Court ordered Mr. Burke to travel across the country to appear before a California grand jury without ever allowing him to see the full documents that justified the extraordinary compulsion,\" Dawud Burke's attorney said in the filing.He challenged the California court's out-of-state subpoena, which he believed was compelling him to travel against his will.Los Angeles Police Department detectives travelled to Texas to bring the singer's family to California to appear before the grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, court records said.The related documents have provided the biggest tranche of information about the case thus far, delineating key details in the ongoing investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy.In November, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Rivas Hernandez's death could be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\".The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.",

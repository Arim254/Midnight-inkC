At the end of the day, I have to concentrate on the environment, the training, the way we play, and, as I said last night, I am still very, very strong in my belief that we are not too far away.</p><p>\"Put it this way - I knew I was getting sacked at Tottenham about three or four months before I did, but that didn't stop me from winning something.\"</p><p>The 60-year-old joined Spurs from Celtic in 2023 and supporters initially warmed to the Australian for his attacking style of play, with the Londoners finishing fifth in the Premier League during his first season.</p><p>Postecoglou's second term was more difficult as Spurs finished fourth from bottom in the table. He did, however, lead the club to their first trophy in 17 years as they beat Manchester United in the Europa League final.</p><p>Forest visit Newcastle United on Sunday (14:00 BST).</p></div><div><figure><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Postecoglou won't let pressure get to him</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"A-dismal-and-difficult-start\"><span>A dismal and difficult start</span></h2><p></p><div><p>With the current poor run of results, there is no denying it has been a difficult start for Postecoglou.</p><p>And the numbers illustrate just how poor Forest have been since his appointment.</p><p>In Postecoglou's six matches, they have been beaten four times across three different competitions.</p><p>No Premier League team has lost as many matches as Forest since his appointment and they have conceded 13 goals - at a rate of 2.17 per game.</p><p>Only Manchester United and Burnley have a worse goals conceded per game average than Forest since Postecoglou's arrival.</p><p>Surprisingly, it is the 35th instance in which a top-flight manager has failed to win any of their first six matches in charge in all competitions.</p><p>Paul Jewell holds the record, having failed to win any of his first 27 matches as Derby County boss in the 2007-2008 season.</p><p>Nuno was dismissed after just three matches of this campaign when Forest were 10th in the table. They are now 17th, having drawn one and lost two of their three domestic matches under Postecoglou. </p><p>He is the first permanent Forest manager in 100 years not to win any of his first six matches. </p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Considered-philosophical-a-cathartic-news-conference\"><span>'Considered & philosophical' - a cathartic news conference</span></h2><p></p><div><p><span>By</span><span>Nick Mashiter</span></p><p><span>Football reporter</span></p></div><div><p>It has been a tense 24 hours at the City Ground and Postecoglou's press conference felt somewhat therapeutic. </p><p>The manager did not change his low tone of voice, but came across considered and even philosophical during his 30 minutes with the media. </p><p>Postecoglou spoke well, outlined why he felt Forest had failed to win any of his six games so far, all the while underlining the need to win before Sunday's trip to Newcastle. </p><p>Under pressure towards the end of his Tottenham reign he often shot back at the press. </p><p>In May, he angrily dismissed a suggestion he was a clown, referencing a report which said he was \"teetering between hero and clown\" before the Europa League final. </p><p>Despite the defeat by Midtjylland, he feels the pressure to win games rather than win over supporters.</p><p>The strength his predecessor Nuno and, before him, Steve Cooper had was their connection with supporters. </p><p>Nuno had to win that trust following scepticism of his appointment in December 2023 after Cooper led Forest back to the Premier League. </p><p>Postecoglou started with negative equity, which has already diminished, having never been a favoured appointment of the fans, but the 60-year-old feels victories will appease the doubters.</p><p>There has been no whirlwind blowing through the City Ground despite the frustrations. </p><p>There is internal sympathy - combined with realism - that other games could have had different outcomes had it not been for individual errors, injuries or loss of form.</p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Its-never-dull-at-Forest\"><span>'It's never dull at Forest'</span></h2><p></p><div><p><i>Nottingham Forest fan view. Pat Riddell - The Famous Club</i></p><p>This season should have been one of Nottingham Forest's best in modern history. Qualification for Europe for the first time in 30 years, the best squad this century and everyone at the club pulling in the same direction.</p><p>Somehow, at least for now, that has all gone out of the window. Nuno has departed, performances have been abject and on Thursday night the City Ground turned on the new manager Ange Postecoglou after just six games.</p><p>And yet it's very much classic Forest, a club that veers from success to self-made disaster like a learner driver who can't stay in a lane.</p><p>For whatever reason, the much-heralded arrival of Edu seems to have destabilised the club. The global head of football only officially arrived in July but allegedly fell out with Nuno and, despite a successful transfer window, things have taken a turn for the worse ever since.</p><p>It might all be entirely coincidental but the lack of continuity at Forest has thrown the club into crisis. It's a perfect storm of events that mean nine games into the season, the Reds have only won once.</p><p>Little wonder that some fans have already turned on him. Is it entirely of his own making? Of course not. Do the players bear some responsibility? Naturally. </p><p>Can he turn it around before it becomes even more toxic? With games against Newcastle, Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth and Manchester United coming up, it's very hard to say.</p><p>But ask any fan and they'll tell you the same, it's never dull at Nottingham Forest.</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div>",

Democrats have hoped to capitalise on the impasse to ensure health insurance subsidies for those with low-income do not expire and reverse the Trump administration's cuts to the Medicaid health programme. </p><p>Republicans, for their part, have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government in a bid to provide <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzyl5x15ro\">healthcare to undocumented immigrants</a> - a charge that Democratic leaders have denied. </p><p>A total of 54 Senators voted in favour of a Republican-led proposal to fund the government, with 44 against and two not voting. </p><p>A separate, Democrat-led proposal also failed, with 45 voting in favour and 52 against. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjyzv6vv8o\">'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdown</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg201rnw2zo\">Trump wields axe over 'Democrat Agencies' as shutdown blame game rages</a></li></ul><p>Both sides have continued to blame the other for the shutdown, with little sign of any progress in negotiations. </p><p>\"We can vote and vote and vote,\" Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley told the BBC. \"But it's up to basically five people.\" </p><p>During a news briefing at the White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of holding Americans \"hostage over their demands\". </p><p>\"The economic consequences of this shut down are piling up every day,\" she added, noting that $15bn (£11.1bn) in GDP could be lost each week as unemployment rises. </p><p>White House officials have repeatedly vowed to lay off federal workers if the shutdown continues, and earlier this week President Donald Trump posted that he would meet with Russell Vought, who heads OMB, to examine \"which of the many Democrat agencies\" that should be cut. </p><p>The White House has provided no scope or timeline for any potential lay-offs or cuts to agencies. Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". </p><p>As part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. </p><p>On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". </p><p>\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" </p><p>Some Democrats - including New York Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>Citing a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. </p><p>Early polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. </p><p>Another 23% said they were unsure.</p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)</i></p></div>",

    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed16 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts.

    "body": "Explosions kill police officer and injure 25 in western Ukraine2 hours agoMaia DaviesAnadolu via Getty ImagesExplosive devices were planted in waste bins, according to policeA 23-year-old female police officer has been killed and 25 people injured in what Ukrainian officials have called a terror attack in the western city of Lviv.Two homemade explosive devices detonated after police crews responded to a reported break-in shortly after midnight on Sunday, the National Police of Ukraine said. The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed \"an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack\" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the \"instruction\" of an agent of Russia's special services.The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka. \"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region,\" the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.National Police of UkrainePolice officer Viktoria Shpylka was killed in the attackPolice said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.\"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,\" it added.Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.\"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the \"act of terrorism that led to grave consequences\".National Police of Ukraine/TelegramA number of officials were also injured after bombs detonated when they arrived to a reported break-in overnightElsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "1 hour agoEd CampbellBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesGordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports.The former prime minister wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Andrew's time as UK trade envoy, the the Sunday Telegraph says.Andrew was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No 10.The paper also reports that Brown has demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links the former prince's government work to late financier Epstein.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Brown told the BBC last week that he had \"submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies\".He said: \"This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.\"When asked about these flights by the BBC in October 2025, the Ministry of Defence said \"it is standard practice for spare capacity at RAF airfields in the UK to be used for private or commercial aircraft, subject to fees which cover all costs\".It added that such use \"is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield\". The MoD repeated this response when asked by the BBC again on Sunday.In an email message, Jon Swain asks if Andrew had secured permission for Epstein to use military bases. The question is forwarded to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell - who in 2021 was convicted in the US for her role in luring underage girls for him.Epstein responds to say, \"just spoke to Larry… it's true\". The man named Larry was Epstein's chief pilot, who arranged many of his landings and logistics. Maxwell then responds using an expletive.The Sunday Telegraph says Brown is requesting that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.Andrew was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of files connected to the late financier's case - including claims he shared information with Epstein while trade envoy.Searches are continuing this weekend at his former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support for children\"The government will not be withdrawing \"effective support\" from children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) under its planned school reforms for England, the education secretary has said.Bridget Phillipson told the BBC the government would be \"spending more money\", not less, on supporting children with SEND as part of its efforts to overhaul the system.But the cabinet minister said children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs\", following leaks which suggested pupils will be assessed as they move into secondary school.The full details of the government's proposed changes to SEND provision in England will be outlined in a White Paper, which will be published on Monday.The policy paper has been highly anticipated by parents who fear the reforms could mean the support their child receives could be limited in some way.The proposals in the paper come as the government faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.Leaks from the paper, reported by the BBC, suggest children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - which are legal documents outlining their extra support entitlement - will be reassessed after primary school from 2029.The BBC understands this will sit alongside an extension of legal rights to include all children with SEND through school-led Individual Support Plans (ISP).Every child with identified special educational needs, including those who do not currently have an EHCP, will have an ISP drawn up by the school, which will have some kind of legal status.Phillipson told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that \"EHCPs will have an important role to play in the new system\".\"The assurance I can give to parents is that under the new system, more children will receive support,\" Phillipson said.\"But they'll receive it more quickly. They'll receive it when they need it and where they need it. Parents won't have to fight so hard to get support through an EHCP.\"She said the new ISPs would have a legal \"underpinning\", meaning \"there are clear routes and clear principles set out in statute that will guide all of this\".When pressed on whether any child who currently receives support would lose it under the proposals, Phillipson said: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support from children.\"She added: \"And what I'll be setting out tomorrow is a decade-long, very careful transition from the system that we have - which everyone recognises isn't working.\"But she acknowledged that children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed\".\"That should be happening at the moment,\" Phillipson said. \"We're meant to be having a system where every year an EHCP is reviewed. That doesn't always happen.\"In an interview on the same programme, shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the Conservatives \"do have some big concerns about what is being floated\".Trott said too many parents \"had to fight for the support and the idea that they're going to be reassessed will be genuinely frightening\".Shadow education secretary Laura Trott: \"We oppose any support being withdrawn\"For Hannah Luxford, whose teenage son has anxiety, it took 18 months to get him an EHCP.\"It's an unhelpful, adversarial, complex system that is designed to make you give up,\" Luxford told the BBC.Now, Luxford says her son is thriving at a funded virtual school. But she worries about his legal rights under the new reforms. \"I want to hear that for those of us already with EHCPs that we are protected,\" she said noting how her son's is getting the \"education he deserves\" at the school he currently attends.\"If that's taken away, it will take us back to where we were five years ago.\"There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among Labour MPs, whose backing will be required if these plans make it to Parliament.The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.In recent analysis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.Luke Sibieta, from the IFS, said the situation is \"worst of all worlds\" with rising numbers of EHCPs and increasing costs but no better quality for children.\"Unfortunately we still have a system that is characterised by conflict, by fight, but also by really patchy levels of quality.\"Under its proposed reforms, the government is also planning to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.It will attempt to do this by reforming how schools target funding for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The latest GCSE results show the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).It had previously dropped to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between, but it began widening in the post-pandemic years. In the 2022/2023, it reached the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94.",

    "body": "3 hours agoOlivia Davies,Chi Chi IzunduandHelena Wilkinson,BBC News InvestigationsPA MediaMetropolitan Police officers were instructed to provide security for a dinner party at Jeffrey Epstein's New York home attended by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, according to emails released by the US Department of Justice.The Met says it has not identified any wrongdoing by its protection officers \"at this time\". On Friday, the force said it is \"identifying and contacting\" former and serving officers who may have relevant information. As a senior working member of the Royal Family at the time, the then Prince Andrew would have been accompanied by close protection officers as part of his security.  Andrew has always strenuously denied any wrongdoing.In a statement to the BBC, the Met said that protection officers were held to the same high standards of professional behaviour as all police officers.\"They know their actions will be open to scrutiny.\"The force added that it does not comment on security arrangements for protected individuals. Emails released in the Epstein files appear to show arrangements for Andrew to stay with Epstein in December 2010.In the correspondence, Andrew's private secretary asks for the address where he would have been staying and \"confirmation on whether there is room for both his protection officers at the house\".Internal emails between Epstein's staff confirm that there was \"room for both Andrew's bodyguards… one on the 4th floor and one on the 5th floor\".The emails suggest that Andrew and his Metropolitan police close protection officers were given a temporary security code to \"get in and out\" of Epstein's New York property. In a message dated 1 December 2010, the evening before Epstein hosted a dinner party, an unidentified member of staff wrote to Epstein: \"The Duke's 2 protection officers along with the state security will all be here for tomorrow's dinner party. Rich has given them instruction on the door\".In a previous statement to the BBC, the Met did not confirm whether the officers stayed at Epstein's home, as suggested in the emails, nor whether they were given a security code to come and go as they needed.The government's Royal Visits Committee is responsible for reviewing plans for official travel by working members of the Royal Family.The committee consists of senior representatives from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), the Royal Household, No10, the Department for Business and Trade, and the Cabinet Office.The BBC approached the FCDO about whether the department knew of various trips made by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to Epstein's properties.A government spokesman said it reviewed the plans for official travel undertaken in 2008 and 2009 by the then Duke of York.It added: \"The RVC is not involved in private travel undertaken by working Members of the Royal Family, or any travel by non-working Members.\"Andrew was arrested on Thursday last week on suspicion of misconduct in public office and released under investigation 11 hours later. Searches at his former Windsor home, Royal Lodge, are continuing. ",

    "body": "37 minutes agoJaroslav LukivReutersThe US has been building up its military presence near Iran in recent weeksUS President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" in the face of Washington's military build-up in the Middle East, the US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff has said.Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Trump was \"curious\" about Iran's position after he had warned of a limited military strike if a deal was not reached on Tehran's nuclear programme.The US and its European allies suspect Iran of moving towards making a nuclear weapon, which it denies. Within Iran, anti-government protests were staged at several universities over the weekend - the first rallies on such a scale since January's deadly crackdown by the authorities, which saw thousands killed. In his interview with Fox News, Witkoff said: \"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated'... because he understands he's got plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated', but why they haven't capitulated.\"\"Why, under this sort of pressure, with the amount of seapower and naval power that we have over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess that we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do?'\"\"And yet it's hard to sort of get them to that place,\" Trump's envoy added.Getty ImagesSteve Witkoff was the lead US negotiator during indirect talks with Iran in Switzerland on TuesdayIran has not publicly commented on Witkoff's remarks.Last Tuesday, US and Iranian officials held indirect talks in Switzerland aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme, saying progress had been made.Despite this, Trump said two days later the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal with Iran would be reached or the US would take military action.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence near Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier has also been deployed, along with destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Scuffles break out at Sharif University in Tehran on SaturdayIn Iran, the BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. They were later seen scuffling with government supporters.Protests were also reported at other universities in Tehran and elsewhere - with students gathering to honour thousands of those killed by authorities last month.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 7,015 people during that wave, including 6,508 protesters, 226 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. The latest figures were updated on 15 February.Hrana also said it was investigating 11,744 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".",

    "body": "Are ties and blazers on the way out? Why some schools are pushing for 'active' uniforms16 hours agoGrace DeanBBCPupils at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active\"If I had a pound for every time I said 'tuck your shirt in', I wouldn't need to teach, I'd be a millionaire,\" laments one Derbyshire secondary school teacher.The teacher, who asked us not to use their real name, works at a school with a strict uniform policy, where pupils can end up in detention if they repeatedly forget their tie or paint their nails. Pupils wear a blazer, shirt and tie, which \"look really uncomfortable\".\"We're meant to stand at the door and greet students just to check that they're wearing the uniform correctly and that their shirts are tucked in and they're looking smart and ready to learn,\" the teacher says. \"It just wastes time.\"She says the regular uniform checks are disruptive for pupils and give teachers unnecessary work.Another secondary school in Derbyshire, Alvaston Moor Academy, is now ditching blazers and ties in favour of a black all-weather jacket and polo shirt from September.The teacher we spoke to called the policy \"genius\". \"It looks so comfortable and it looks smart still,\" she says.One teacher called Alvaston Moor Academy's new uniform \"genius\"Currently, learning to tie a tie for secondary school is almost a rite of passage in the UK. In fact, a 2020 study of the uniform policies of every state secondary school in Scotland found that 90% required ties and 66% had blazers.But Alvaston Moor's new uniform appears to be part of a broader movement to introduce more practical school clothing. Proponents say this encourages children to be more active, is more comfortable and makes life easier for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) - but others argue traditional uniforms look smarter and instil discipline.One concern some parents and staff have about traditional school clothing is that blazers, which some schools demand pupils wear at all times, aren't always weather appropriate.'It's a bigger issue than people realise'One Leeds grandmother says her 11-year-old granddaughter is often \"freezing\" at school wearing her blazer, as opposed to a jumper: \"That isn't conducive to children's learning.\"A former teacher in Walsall says the secondary school where she used to work had the opposite problem - pupils usually weren't allowed to take their blazers off, leaving them uncomfortable at times. Mum Laura has a similar issue with her son, who has ADHD and often gets hot and claustrophobic in his formal shirt and tie.Laura's son isn't alone. Traditional school uniforms can often be difficult for SEND pupils.\"It's actually a bigger issue than people realise,\" says Duncan, from Devon, whose teenage daughter is autistic and has sensory processing disorder, which means she is more sensitive to how clothing feels against her skin.His daughter switched schools two years ago, and one of the main reasons was her school's inflexible uniform policy, he says.The teenager found some aspects of her uniform so uncomfortable that they became painful, like the embroidered logo, seams and tag on her polo shirt, her dad says.\"She was refusing school for a long time,\" Duncan says. He says her previous SEND school turned down his proposal that she wear her own T-shirt in the school's colour and black leggings or jogging bottoms.Among primary schools, the push for more practical school uniforms is largely to encourage physical activity and play. More than half of children aged five to 16 weren't meeting the chief medical officer's guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity per day in the 2023-2024 school year, says Sport England.Link to behaviour \"If you were taking your kids out on a Saturday to play, there is no way that you would choose the kind of clothes that we send children to school in,\" says Prof Helen Dodd, who researches children's play at the University of Exeter. \"The clothes that they're wearing are getting in the way.\"A small-scale 2012 study by Australian academics suggested that girls at primary schools were \"significantly more active\" during breaks and at lunchtime when they wore their sports uniform rather than their winter uniform. A 2021 study was less conclusive but suggested that wearing sports uniforms \"may yield small improvements\" in activity levels throughout the day.Academics and parents also push back against some of the main arguments in favour of more traditional uniforms - for example, that they encourage better behaviour and prepare pupils for the world of work.\"The research evidence does not support that smart uniform affects behaviour,\" says Dodd from the University of Exeter.And fewer people are wearing blazers and ties to work after the pandemic led to people dressing more informally for the office. What people wear to the office has \"just gone so casual\" in the past few years, personal stylist Karina Taylor previously told BBC News, attributing this to the rise in remote work.But many people told BBC News they were still in favour of having some kind of uniform to create a sense of community and to stop pupils who couldn't afford the latest trends feeling left out.\"I think you can have a school uniform without it being cumbersome,\" says Duncan, who also has a son who wears a blazer and tie to middle school.'You don't have to wear a uniform to learn'Some schools have already ditched blazers and ties in favour of a more comfortable uniform.A survey of teachers in 2024 by the app Teacher Tapp suggested that fewer secondary school pupils were wearing ties than the previous year.The pandemic affected school uniform policies, as many pupils could wear what they wanted for virtual lessons, says Dr Rachel Shanks of the University of Aberdeen.\"People could see, especially teenagers, you don't have to be wearing a uniform to be learning,\" she says.And after lockdown, some primary schools began letting pupils come in in their sports kits on days they had PE, \"and a lot of schools have kept to that\" after realising pupils were more comfortable, she says.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to what it called an \"always active\" uniform in 2024 with support from Youth Sport Trust. Pupils now wear leggings or jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a hoodie, with black trainers.Head teacher Iain Williamson tells BBC News it was \"one of the best changes\" the school had introduced, with attendance and behaviour improving afterwards.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to an \"always active\" uniform in 2024He reels off the benefits: PE lessons are 20 minutes longer now since pupils don't need to get changed, they don't have to worry about bringing their sports kit, the uniform is quick drying and doesn't need ironing, and pupils are more active in the playground.Many staff members at the school even opt to wear the active uniforms, too, he says.Some schools say less formal uniforms particularly benefit girls.Girls at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active, head teacher Catherine Parker tells BBC News. Since introducing the new uniform, girls play more during break time, she says.Rachel's daughter is in year seven at a secondary school in Cheshire where pupils wear polo shirts with a choice of sweatshirt, jumper or fleece.\"It's really practical, it looks really smart,\" Rachel says.Duncan's daughter's new SEND school doesn't have a uniform.\"She's allowed to wear what she wants and she's comfortable in because there is an understanding there that it makes a big difference to her ability to engage,\" she says.",

    "body": "I didn't know I was experiencing burnout until it was too late16 hours agoGeorgia Levy-CollinsBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesLaviai Nielsen won two bronze medals at the 2024 Summer OlympicsYou've just won two Olympic medals, reached the peak of your career so far, you're the strongest you've ever been, right? Wrong.Laviai Nielsen says straight after the 2024 Paris Olympics she felt \"emotionally, psychologically and mentally\" burnt out.Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, the 29-year-old says that once she realised she had burnout it was too late.\"It would take all of my energy to even get out of bed and get to the track,\" she says.\"It felt very unnatural for me, to think: 'Hold on, I need to slow down'.\"Newsbeat has been hearing from young people who say they have experienced burnout for a range of reasons, including unmanageable workload and pressure - with some pushing back key milestones, like saving for a house, as a result.In Nielsen's case, the Team GB sprinter decided to slow down and ended up taking a three-month break.\"It goes against everything you think an athlete should be,\" she says.\"The conversations leading up to the decision were the hardest bit, but once I made that decision, it was so easy.\"Nielsen began representing her country in her teens and won her first senior World Championship medal in 2017.But by the time she'd reached the Paris Olympics, mid-twenties activities - like socialising - became \"exhausting\".Despite competing at a high level athletically, she's not alone in her experience and young people are struggling with burnout in the workplace.Nielsen took three months off to recover from burnout The charity describes burnout as \"a state of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion\". It can build up over a long period of time - meaning it can take a while to recognise.The charity found that while young people are often seen as championing improved attitudes towards mental health at work, many were found to be \"staying silent\" about their own stress.Mental Health UK's 2026 burnout report also highlighted other aspects of life.\"This group is facing pressures both inside and outside work, alongside an uncertain job market where AI is increasingly seen as a threat to some entry-level roles,\" says the charity's chief executive Brian Dow.\"For many, the social contract that rewarded previous generations for hard work is breaking down,\" he adds.Younger workers aged 18 to 24 were second most likely to report stress due to money worries (64%), behind 65% of those aged 25 to 34, who agreed.University students are also struggling, says cognitive behavioural therapist Hannah Paskin.\"We're now getting lots and lots of graduates that can't get into graduate-level type jobs,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"So they're working really hard at university and then basically entering into quite low-paid, not career-oriented jobs.\"HandoutMimi Abbas returned home to family after experiencing burnout at university Mimi Abbas started to experience burnout in her final year of university and struggled with life after graduation.\"You know that you only have a month left of your degree and nothing in you has the spark or motivation to just carry on,\" Abbas says.The 23-year-old then returned home and spent six months applying for jobs, which she describes as a \"really difficult period\".\"It was just never-ending,\" she tells Newsbeat.The Bristol graduate ended up landing a job in the events industry, which she said was \"great\" but \"tiring with long hours\".\"I was going into the office, working, coming home, falling asleep. I didn't really have the energy to see my friends or go to the gym,\" she recalls. \"Any hobbies or passions I had on the side were kind of just put on the side.\"Abbas ended up leaving her corporate role and withdrawing her house savings.She now works part-time jobs in London - and feels better for it.\"I'd rather be happy and not feel so drained all the time,\" she says.@drbeccasalmonDr Becca Salmon said she was relieved when she took a step back from her workplace Dr Becca Salmon began posting about her own burnout after she left her NHS job.\"I look back on videos and pictures of myself from when I was working as a doctor and I look so unwell,\" she tells Newsbeat.The 29-year-old's video about quitting her role as a doctor in January 2024 sparked a big reaction and following.\"I had so much anxiety posting it, but the support and the familiarity from other people towards that was crazy,\" says Salmon.She says it took her six months to a year to fully recover from burnout.\"I think that's what people quite like in my story,\" she adds.\"It's just nice to know that burnout doesn't have to be the end.\"HandoutSpencer Clark has felt burnout trying to pursue his dream role while also working full-timeSpencer Clark, 23, can also relate to feeling burnout when trying to pursue a dream role.He tells Newsbeat he has been building his social media presence as he wants to be an online fitness coach, but is also working a full-time job in the precious metal industry so he can pay the bills. \"I do 12-hour shifts at work and trying to muddle all of them together has just been really hard,\" Clark says.\"My nutrition's on point, I go to the gym, I'm a healthy guy, but I've just overworked myself clearly.\"He says he often sees self-proclaimed \"fitness gurus\" on social media who are encouraging others to reduce their sleep to fit more in, but he believes that's not the answer. While the Mental Health UK report shows a notable number of young people are being affected by burnout, clinical psychologist Dr Claire Plumbly says it is not a new issue - it's just \"being talked about a lot more\".She explains that because it's not an official mental health diagnosis, doctors previously weren't using the term, but there is now greater understanding of it. Plumbly, who has written a book on how to manage burnout, also notes it doesn't just affect the younger workforce. \"Millennials and Gen X, they'll have better-paid jobs, perhaps, but extra responsibilities,\" she adds.Nicki CameronHannah Paskin says stepping back and slowing down can help ease burnoutHowever, there are aspects of today's digital society which can particularly affect young people, therapist Paskin says.\"From quite a young age, their life has been on social media, through teenage years when we're very impressionable,\" she says.\"A lot of people's default when they can't switch off is to scroll.\"Scrolling in bed before they go to sleep, and first thing when they're getting up.\"Choice overload, particularly for chronically online young people, can also lead to burnout, she adds. Preventing burnout There are things you can do to help prevent burnout, Paskin says.\"It's that desire to step out of the commercial world, step out of all those sorts of bits of life, step back from phone use.\" She suggests that getting breathing space from stress can restore energy, which is something Nielsen is doing.She is back to training and says rest is her top priority.\"We are a society that pride ourselves on continuing to work hard and going higher and pushing higher,\" Nielsen says.\"Rest is not laziness. It's a necessity.\"The professional athlete says that she now has more balance as a result.\"Instead of being solely focused on athletics, I'm making sure that I'm nourishing some things away from the track,\" she adds.Salmon agrees, saying she now limits how much she books in.\"You're definitely not alone and it definitely does get better,\" she says.\"Be kind to yourself, take that rest.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on thisRelated links",

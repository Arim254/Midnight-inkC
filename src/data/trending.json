    "body": "12 hours agoAlex ForsythPolitical CorrespondentBBCReform UK could win more seats than any other party at the next general election - perhaps enough to form a government. Or so suggest repeated opinion polls, released since May. That was also when Reform won control of 10 English local authorities - so what does their first six months at the helm at local level show about what a UK government led by them could look like?Listen to Alex reading this articleLast month a leaked video recording showed Linden Kemkaran, Reform UK's leader in Kent, swearing at councillors from her own party and telling them to \"suck it up\" if they didn't agree with her.The footage became national news - insights into tensions within local government are, after all, rarely made public, and Kent is Reform UK's self-professed flagship council.Plenty of critics seized on the incident.Reform suspends four councillors after video leakLabour MPs in Kent labelled her \"unprofessional\" and \"not up to the job,\" and local Liberal Democrat and Green groups claimed Reform's running of the council had descended into chaos.Five of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party amid the upheaval. Kemkaran, meanwhile, remains firmly in post. And she has declared that it is \"business as usual\" at Kent County Council.To some the fallout was undoubtedly damaging and has prompted questions about whether this insurgent party, that is consistently topping national opinion polls, really is a credible force ready to run the country - something they are trying to prove.Danny Kruger, who is one of Reform's five MPs, has his own take. Last month he described the party as a bit of a pirate ship with an \"ill-disciplined\" crew and a \"buccaneering\" captain, but added: \"A powerful ship with a dangerous broadside, a terror to its rivals…\"The job… is to help turn this pirate ship into His Majesty's Royal Navy ship, ready to enter the King's service and serve our nation.\"Gareth Fuller / PAFive of Kent's Reform councillors have been expelled from the party. Linden Kemkaran (left) remains in postSo what can we glean from Reform's performance at local level about how they lead - and how well they have so far fared on delivering their promises?These are, after all, promises that are not dissimilar in nature to those they would need to keep if they were successful in their bid to reach Number 10.Reform's own version of DOGEIt has been exactly six months since the local elections saw Reform take outright control of 10 English local authorities, including six of 21 county councils.In all it won 677 seats - more than any other party, amounting to 41% of the total up for election.Before the elections, Nigel Farage addressed a packed rally in Birmingham promising his party would \"send in the auditors… get rid of the fraudulent contracts… cut spending\" if it won.Shortly after their success in the local elections, Reform launched a \"DOGE\" unit, based on billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to cut spending in the US with a Department of Government Efficiency.A photo call on the steps of Kent County Council followed, with a promise that a team of soft ware engineers, data analysts and forensic auditors would \"visit and analyse\" local authorities to identify \"wasteful spending\".But the unit has run into legal challenges in accessing sensitive council data. So far it is reported to have visited only a handful of the councils in England that Reform controls.AFP via Getty ImagesLocal elections saw Reform UK take outright control of 10 English local authoritiesZia Yusuf, Reform's head of policy who led the DOGE team until last month, acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming \"overwhelming demands\" from Whitehall. Nonetheless he insists that hundreds of millions of pounds in savings have already been identified.\"The reality is there's a lot of information that can be shared… because it's in the public domain already,\" he says. \"[DOGE] has been working with every single one of our councils on an ongoing basis.\"He points to certain decisions by Kent County Council, including halting a planned office move and stopping net-zero schemes, as examples of the savings he says Reform has found.Carl Court /Getty ImagesZia Yusuf, a former Reform chairman, led the DOGE team until last monthCouncils spend the bulk of their budgets on statutory services that they have to provide by law, and the cost of these services has spiralled in recent years.The County Councils' Network, which represents some of England's largest local authorities, says its members spend on average 69% of their budgets on adult social care and children's services, with some spending up to 76% - an increase from 63% a decade ago.Reform's argument is that there's still \"waste\" to be found, with Yusuf saying: \"This idea that… because social care is statutory there's no point in finding those savings - we don't buy that.\"But Stuart Hoddinott, an associate director at the Institute for Government think tank, believes that the savings Reform have identified so far are \"minuscule\" in comparison to the financial challenge facing the sector.\"They've found things that are just so tiny to be completely insignificant or are cutting programmes that might actually end up saving money in the longer run. \"It has just been a complete sort of mirage so far... It's like somebody who makes £30,000 worrying about losing 2p per year.\"Budget pressures and a 'broken' systemThe pressure on council budgets across the country has been well-documented. Ahead of this year's spending review, the Local Government Association estimated councils would face a funding gap of £8.4bn by 2028/29.The controversial Kent council meeting, in which tensions boiled over, was a private discussion that seemed to focus, among other things, on both budgets and local government reorganisation.It is another illustration of how, when it comes to setting a budget, Reform is now facing many of the same challenges as parties that preceded it.Stuart Hoddinott acknowledges that Reform has entered a \"broken\" system, given the pressure on funding for statutory services and cuts already made across the board - but he accuses the party of \"bluster\" and \"outlandish promises\".\"They have focused on culture wars, things like 'Oh we'll just cut DEI (diversity equity and inclusion) programmes from local authorities and won't run a Pride flag up the pole every June, then that will solve our financial problems,'\" he argues.\"They were also very naive to think that they would be the ones to solve it [budget pressures] given that you have had 15 years of 300-odd local authorities all battling this and trying to come up with solutions.\"More from InDepthReform's DOGE unit has now had a change of personnel.Richard Tice, the party's deputy leader, has taken over, a change he says was simply a \"natural evolution\" from Yusuf.He has said billions can be saved, and that his focus will be on local government pension schemes, property and \"waste-related contracts\". The party, he adds, will also make announcements on support for children with special educational needs and disabilities, which is a cost pressure for councils.\"You'll be hearing over the next few weeks in areas where we have achieved savings, we have identified savings – and where we need to have some serious discussions about what actually is sensible in certain areas,\" he has said.But these are thorny issues that will likely prove controversial.PA MediaZia Yusuf (pictured with Nigel Farage) acknowledges there is a limit on how much control local authorities have over their budgets, blaming 'overwhelming demands' from WhitehallTony Travers, a professor in the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, argues that any benefits would likely take time to filter through.\"Reforming the pension system… might produce benefits for local government in the medium term, but it's probably not going to do it for next May, next April,\" he says.\"That's the trouble. With a lot of these things, they can't be done quickly or as quickly as Reform needs.\"He believes that Reform's cost-cutting narrative was, ultimately, \"never realistic\" - and in his view the party is now facing the \"dawning reality\" of an \"extraordinary period of financial constraint\" that other councils have faced before them.Future of council tax risesNow, as councils begin the process of setting budgets for next year, the picture looks bleak for many - including those led by Reform.Lancashire is facing a budget gap of £100m over the next two years; in West Northamptonshire the council has warned of \"tough choices\" as it tries to plug a £50m gap; while Worcestershire has asked residents for their views on a potential council tax rise of 10%, combined with millions of pounds of cuts.And Warwickshire council - led by George Finch, who was just 19 years old when he took office this summer - warned of \"difficult decisions to come\".Getty ImagesGeorge Finch was just 19 years old when he took office this summerEven though the government has increased the amount of funding available to councils this year and is introducing a new method of allocating funding from next year, claiming it is \"fixing a broken system\", this all still poses a challenge for Reform UK, if it is to fully meet its promises to cut costs and save money.Early indications are that Reform-led councils will raise council tax from April 2026 – something acknowledged by both Richard Tice and Zia Yusuf - though both say the focus is on keeping increases low.\"We never said we would cut council tax,\" Tice says. \"But if you can identify the savings, identify what you shouldn't be doing… then we can achieve lower increases than anybody else.\"Yusuf suggested the rises were unlikely to exceed inflation levels.\"I would expect certainly [in] most of our councils [for] council tax not to go up by more - it is their decision, but it will be a rise in line with inflation, as opposed to the council going into bankruptcy or a rise much more than 5%,\" he says.Getty ImagesReform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises(His comments came before Reform-led Worcestershire signalled the possibility of a 10% rise.)But keeping council tax relatively low sometimes entails spending cuts – which might not prove popular.And the question now is whether Reform really can prove to be better custodians of public money than their predecessors – and avoid the effective bankruptcy that has hit some other local authorities, while providing value for money.Scaling up the challengeAt the start of the year, Reform UK, Labour and the Conservatives were all averaging about 25% in opinion polls registering voting intention. But in May that all changed: for more than five months Reform's average poll result has hovered around 30%, while the two other parties have now fallen below 20%.Prof Travers believes the party would likely encounter challenges similar to those it is currently facing in councils were it to win the keys to Number 10. It has previously promised tax cuts, and an overhaul of government spending to increase efficiency, echoing its programme for local government.Already there are signs they are realising what is realistic, and what is not. Earlier this week Farage rowed back on his party's previous promise to deliver tax cuts worth £90bn a year. \"Substantial tax cuts\" are not currently \"realistic\" because of the \"dire state\" of the public finances, he said, proposing instead \"relatively modest\" changes, such as raising tax thresholds and scrapping inheritance tax for family-run businesses.\"The truth is, the constraints of real government would be just as real if they got in at Westminster,\" Prof Travers says.\"Could you really cut benefits for millions of people? It's not that easy… So all of this is the kind of local version of the fact that even political parties who attempt to cut or reduce NHS spending, find themselves increasing it. It's just a local version of that.\"Ben Ramanauskas, a senior research fellow in economics at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange, argues that Reform's instinct to look to cut back waste is right – despite the challenges. \"Definitely, any party should be looking for efficiency savings,\" he says. \"This is taxpayers' money being spent and the priority has to be essential public services. There are examples of where there is some waste going on.\"But it is a very tough job for local authorities and councillors,\" he adds. \"And I think any party in that position would possibly struggle, given just how our system operates.\"He argues it will be easier to \"scale up\" savings at a national level, with the ability to pull all the levers of power.Reform’s main risksLooking ahead to the next general election, it would be logical to assume that the fate of Reform - and whether or not it will win enough support to make the leap to Downing Street - rests in part on how it fares at the helm of the councils with these gnarly financial challenges.After all, Reform has pointed the finger at Labour and the Conservatives for what they say are broken promises - so what are the consequences if they cannot deliver on their own pledges in local government?Luke Tryl, director of focus group and polling company More in Common, argues that this link is not necessarily as direct as it may seem.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesDissatisfaction with the economy, NHS and immigration is driving support for Reform\"If you look at the reasons people went and voted for Reform in the local elections, they were number one – overwhelmingly - migration, and Channel crossings in particular. And number two, general disillusionment with the main parties.\"I'm just not sure that Reform's failure to find savings necessarily helps with that.\"Instead, he believes that one of the main risks for Reform that could cost it supporters would be a significant failing in one of the councils – such as a crisis in social care, or bins, or bankruptcy.\"I don't say that the message of 'Reform has put your council tax up' is going to be deterring people in the general election,\" he added.Getty ImagesReform UK could be the biggest party in the next parliamentAs to whether Reform is ready, based on the evidence so far from their leadership of England's councils, in the six months since May, the jury is out.\"It's very difficult to say exactly that Reform councillors are more or less chaotic than other councillors,\" says Stuart Hoddinott.\"They get more attention. So these stories tend to blow a bit more. Having said that, there does seem to have been a lot of incidents since the election.\"Meanwhile, the party's performance in councils has arguably faced even more scrutiny than their political opponents.And while the party says it is making progress on its promises, it is clear it is grappling with the same set of challenges as the parties that came before.So far, it seems the solutions are not proving easy to find for anyone.Top image credits: Gareth Fuller/ PA - Jacob King/ PA and Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Conor Bradley was driven by the full force of Anfield's adoration, while Trent Alexander-Arnold – the local boy who left Liverpool behind - was given a brutal and hostile reminder of his fall from grace.Bradley was earmarked as Alexander-Arnold's heir apparent from the moment he announced his decision to leave Liverpool for Real Madrid, so once the fates paired the two European superpowers together in the Champions League, the stage was set.And what a contrast it was as the 22-year-old Northern Ireland right-back was the shining symbol of a Liverpool display that harked back to their Premier League title-winning best as Real Madrid were swept aside.Alexander-Arnold, who started on the bench, all the while was left in no doubt how the fans who once sang about 'the Scouser in our team' now regard him.It was a day of unrelenting ill-feeling aimed in Alexander-Arnold's direction, from his mural near Anfield being vandalised with the words \"Adios El Rata\" before the game to the Anfield anger provoked by what many Liverpool fans regard as his betrayal.Bradley actually fuelled the fury and scorn aimed in Alexander-Arnold's direction with a magnificent display that reduced the formidable Vinicius Jr to a passenger, only able to offer theatrics – poor theatrics at that – in the face of the youngster's physical dominance.Every Bradley tackle was cheered to the echo, every pass greeted with Anfield's approval, his name chanted with gusto, not just for his own efforts but as a voluble reminder to Alexander-Arnold that there was a new kid in town, that he was now firmly a figure from the past.Bradley, unsurprisingly, even won the admiration of head coach Arne Slot.\"Conor Bradley was outstanding,\" he said. \"To be up against Vinicius so many times one against one is not for everyone, but he was outstanding.\"If the insults daubed on Alexander-Arnold's mural did not make him aware of what was awaiting him, he was left in no doubt when he trotted on to warm-up as one of Real Madrid's substitutes before kick-off, jeers ringing around Anfield, the sound of disapproval repeated when his name was read out.And just when it looked like he might escape the full-scale vitriol, Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso introduced him as an 81st-minute substitute as they tried to level Liverpool's lead, deservedly given to them by Alexis Mac Allister's header just after the hour.The response to Alexander-Arnold's arrival was savage, as were the mocking jeers that greeted a late cross that drifted aimlessly out of play.Alexander-Arnold's unhappy cameo was played out to the sound of Liverpool's fans reminding him of those who had stayed loyal despite temptations and opportunities to leave Anfield, namely former captain Steven Gerrard, who watched on from the stands.This was Liverpool's night, Bradley's night - the sort of night Anfield revels in as the presence of their former star acted as an even more potent catalyst to turn up the volume.And Liverpool, who had looked lost with six defeats in seven games before Aston Villa were beaten on Saturday, responded with a performance that was easily their best this season, a timely reminder of the quality that saw them stroll to the title.Slot relished Liverpool's return to winning ways, saying: \"It is nicer if you win games than if you lose as a manager. If you lose, then it takes all of your time because you so badly want to change it, but you also try to be the same manager and person that you are when you are winning.\"I did the same, told them that with our set-piece balance it is really hard to win games of football. Our open-play chance creation was good all season apart from the Villa game, which we won.\"So I tried to tell them what was actually happening instead of all the noise around them. The only thing I can do is tell them my opinion and hope it is strong enough for them to believe me.\"It was only the shadow of brilliant Real keeper Thibaut Courtois that threatened to stop Liverpool getting what they merited, with a stunning individual performance that revived memories of how he defied them when Jurgen Klopp's team lost the 2022 Champions League final in Paris.The Belgian made a string of magnificent saves, including four from Dominik Szoboszlai and a remarkable reflex stop from Virgil van Dijk's header, before even he was powerless to stop Mac Allister's header from the Hungarian's free-kick.Liverpool's narrow victory margin does not touch the sides of their domination from first whistle to last, these crucial three points pushing them into sixth place in the Champions League table, a standing that will put them in the last 16 without the need to resort to a play-off if maintained.Szoboszlai and Mac Allister ruled midfield, while Florian Wirtz provided some of the subtle touches that made his name at Bayer Leverkusen. Hugo Ekitike was a constant menace.Liverpool were, unlike so often this season, rock solid at the back as Kylian Mbappe was marginalised, delivering a dreadful, error-strewn display. Vinicius had been beaten by Bradley long before the end.If it was a miserable night for Alexander-Arnold, it was not much better for Jude Bellingham, offered the Anfield stage to deliver a reminder of his class before England head coach Thomas Tuchel names his squad to face Serbia and Albania after excluding him last time.He provided one moment of danger in the first half when he forced Giorgi Mamardashvili to save with his legs, but was otherwise anonymous as Real failed to establish any sort of stranglehold.Bellingham conceded the free-kick in a dangerous position that led to Mac Allister's goal, offering little as Real tried to force their way back into contention, although he was not alone there.He offered words of sympathy to Alexander-Arnold: \"Obviously, it is one of those things in football. The fans booing isn't a reflection of how they feel about him.\"I think it is more to give their team the edge and throw him off a little bit. I am sure they're appreciative of what he has done for the club.\"Alexander-Arnold, once an Anfield idol, probably could not wait to get back to his new Madrid home, while life for Liverpool suddenly looks much brighter ahead of Sunday's meeting with Manchester City at Etihad Stadium.",

    "body": "Several critically injured after driver rams into 10 people on French island52 minutes agoLaura GozziThibault BrechkoffThe local mayor said a crisis unit was set up after the suspect had deliberately targeted pedestrians and cyclistsA driver has rammed his car into pedestrians and cyclists on the holiday island of Ile d'Oléron, off the west coast of France, leaving four people in a critical condition.A local man in his mid-30s had deliberately driven into people and he was arrested after being immobilised with a stun gun, authorities said. The man drove some distance between two villages on the island, mowing down several people including a young girl, the mayor of Dolus d'Oléron Thibault Brechkoff said.He eventually abandoned his vehicle and tried to set fire to it before running away, Brechkoff said. The public prosecutor for La Rochelle, Arnaud Laraize, said the suspect was known to police and that he shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") at the moment of his arrest.The 35-year-old man is being held by police in Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron on suspicion of attempted murder, however France's anti-terror authorities have not been put in charge of the case.A popular holiday destination, the Ile d'Oléron is metropolitan France's second largest island after Corsica and connected to the mainland by a road bridge.Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said an inquiry had been opened into the incident and he was heading to the scene.The incident took place around 08:45 (07:45 GMT), and local reports said a gas canister had been found in the back of the suspect's car after he tried to set the vehicle alight.Witnesses described seeing a series of incidents in several places on the island, including the villages of Dolus d'Oléron and Saint-Pierre-d'Oléron, which came to an end outside a bakery.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterGetty ImagesAdverts for LED masks that are not registered with the medicines regulator have been banned (stock photo)A number of adverts for LED face masks have been banned for making unauthorised claims they can improve acne and rosacea.The popularity of at-home beauty devices has surged in recent years with social media feeds filled with influencers unboxing and reviewing the masks as the latest skincare trend.However, dermatologists are divided over whether light-emitting diodes (LED) in at-home masks can deliver the results of medical-grade devices used in clinics. The advertising watchdog banned adverts for cosmetic devices which were not registered with the medicines regulator.LED therapy is thought to stimulate cells and improve the skin, but devices must be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to make medical claims about skin conditions like acne and rosacea.Devices registered with the MHRA can be searched on its Public Access Registration Database (PARD). Dermatologists have previously told the BBC there have not been clinical trials with large enough sample sizes for long enough periods of time to know the benefits of at-home LED masks.The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) used AI to search for ads which might break the rules, and the bans followed that search.'My acne had disappeared'An advert on Project E Beauty's website showed before and after images of a woman's forehead with and without acne, with the words: \"By week three, my acne had disappeared\". The ad stated: \"Our most advanced LED mask for deeper skin renewal\". It claimed it \"treats acne\" and offered \"83% improvement in acne lesions in four weeks\".The ASA said \"no medical claims could be made for the product, whether or not such claims appeared in customer testimonials.\"Project E Beauty LLC said it had removed potential medical claims relating to \"healing\", \"treating acne\" and \"rosacea\".It also said it had amended the advert to state that any references to acne in before/after photos and reviews were testimonials based on personal experiences.Silk'nThis advert was banned for making a medicinal claim about acneA paid-for social media ad for Silk'n featured a video of a woman using an LED face mask with the caption: \"Finished with the blue light to help treat my acne and scars\".Invention Works BV, trading as Silk'n, acknowledged the term \"acne\" constituted a medical claim. It said the advert was created by a woman after prolonged use of the mask and the wording reflected her individual perception and results.The ASA told Silk'n the adverts must not appear again in that form.BeautaholicsBeautaholics agreed not to make claims about acne in adverts in futureOther adverts banned include one on the Beautaholics website for a RejuvaLux mask which stated: \"This mask provides targeted solutions for...acne...rosacea.\" Beautaholics said it would not make claims regarding the treatment or prevention of medical conditions in future.A paid-for social media ad for a mask by Luyors Retail Inc was also banned after it stated: \"It helps tackle everything from acne...with clinical precision.\"Luyors said it would ensure future advertising did not refer to \"acne\" or other terms that could imply a medicinal claim.Izzy Dharmasiri at the ASA said ads \"can have an influence on what people buy,\" so it was \"important that advertisers don't blur the line between cosmetic benefits and medicinal claims.\"She said advertisers \"need to have evidence to back up any claims they make in their ads\". She said the banning of the adverts was part of its work to protect vulnerable people \"seeking genuine solutions to medical problems\".",

    "body": "Bonfire Night's Beaver supermoon to be biggest and brightest of 2025Image source, GettyBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter  and Simon King Lead Weather PresenterUpdated 2 hours agoFireworks won't be the only spectacular sight in the night sky tonight.The largest and brightest Moon of the year - the full Beaver supermoon - will also be shining.Rising at 15:55 GMT on Wednesday evening this supermoon is the second of three this year.However, you probably have more of a guarantee of seeing the fireworks than the Moon due to the large amount of cloud which is forecast across the United Kingdom.Why is this Moon a 'supermoon'?Image caption, At its 'perigee' the Moon is 30,000 miles closer to Earth than at its 'apogee'The Moon does not orbit the earth in a perfect circle but has more of an egg-shaped, elliptical orbit. Therefore it is not always the same distance from the Earth.  At its closest point - or perigee - the Moon is about 220,000 miles away from Earth, whereas at its furthest point - or apogee - it is around 250,000 miles away.If the Moon is full at its closest point to Earth, or within 90% of its perigee, it can be referred to as a 'supermoon'.  The term was first coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle to describe full Moons that appear noticeably larger and brighter as they coincide with the perigee. They can seem to be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full Moons, external.This month's Beaver Moon will be the closest full Moon to Earth this year, therefore it will be the brightest and will appear to be the largest.Image source, Dan Kitwood/Getty imagesImage caption, Last month's Harvest supermoon - pictured here with a passenger plane flying above London -  was the first of the yearWhy is it a called a Beaver Moon?Image source, Andrew Matthews/PA WireImage caption, After centuries of absence, beavers are starting to roam wild again in parts of England and ScotlandEach month's full Moon has a nickname reflecting what is happening in nature and the weather at that time of year. Many of these names date back centuries and some are more obvious than others such as February's 'Snow Moon' or June's 'Strawberry Moon'.But what about November's Beaver Moon? It is thought that the term may have been used in a range of cultures from certain Native American tribes to early European settlers.  It is the time of year beavers become particularly active as they build dams and stock up on food for the winter.Beavers in the UK were hunted to extinction in the 16th Century, mainly for their furs.  However, in recent years rewilding projects have been reintroducing beavers to several parts of England and Scotland. They can bring huge benefits to nature, including improving river water quality and increasing biodiversity.Whilst this will be the brightest and largest full Moon of 2025, you won't have to wait long until the next one, as we will see the third and final supermoon of the year on 4 December.What is the forecast?Image caption, Current most likely weather conditions for Bonfire Night's Beaver Moon viewingIt has been incredibly mild for early November with a maximum temperature on Tuesday of 17.6 C in Cambridge. While this is shy of the record November maximum of 22.4 C in 2015 but still around 6 or 7 C above average.The milder weather though has also brought a lot of cloud and rain.And that rain has been especially heavy in western areas of England and Wales with some areas such as the Lake District already recording a whole months worth of rain since the beginning of November.Wednesday evening will be cloudy with rain at times across Scotland and Northern Ireland and so little chance of seeing the full supermoon.Across England and Wales, the cloud will be more variable so there will be occasional breaks where the supermoon will be visible. If you do not get a chance to view the Beaver Moon, the next and final supermoon of 2025 will be next month on 4 December.

    "body": "12 hours agoEmma Simpson,business correspondent and Esyllt Carr,business reporterThe oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has said she can now \"look to the future\" after receiving her long-awaited settlement from one of the government's compensation schemes.\"I can settle up my affairs. I can turn the heating up full blast, and that will be wonderful,\" 92-year-old Betty Brown told the BBC.Mrs Brown was forced out of her Post Office in County Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent more than £50,000 of their savings to cover shortfalls that did not exist.Her settlement comes after it was confirmed that campaigner Sir Alan Bates had agreed to a multi-million-pound compensation figure from the Post Office.\"At last, after 26 years, they've recognised justice,\" she said, adding: \"pity they took so long.\"Her Post Office had been one of the most successful in the region but eventually she had to sell it at a loss.Talking about what happened, she previously said it \"absolutely destroyed my whole life\".The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully prosecuted because of it providing incorrect information. Thousands more, like Mrs Brown, were forced to make up for the alleged losses at their branches across the UK.The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK.Mrs Brown was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Sir Alan Bates against the Post Office.She said it was \"fantastic\" that Sir Alan had received his final settlement too, describing him as her \"hero\".\"I think at long, long last, the government are starting to listen. Not only are they starting to listen, they're beginning to act,\" Mrs Brown said.Both Mrs Brown and Sir Alan were part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, and those claimants were offered the option of taking a fixed sum of £75,000 or pursuing their own settlement.In Dec 2024, Mrs Brown was originally offered just under a third of what she'd claimed for in compensation. That was gradually upped to 70% earlier this year, which she rejected. Her case was then escalated to an independent panel.There were two main sticking points. Firstly, the Post Office knocked 10% off the income she'd been making when she was running her branch, which had a big impact on the calculation for her future loss of earnings. And then it downgraded her claim for psychological damages from severe to moderately severe, even though her medical report had concluded it was severe.Mrs Brown took up the opportunity to address the panel, an experience she said felt like reliving the past.\"The emotions, the fear, the terror was all coming back,\" she said.The panel found in her favour.By then, Mrs Brown had already dropped a couple of incidental claims for business costs, because she didn't have any paperwork and the lack of evidence was being challenged by the governmentShe has now ended up with about 95% of what she originally claimed for – and Mrs Brown is happy with that.The latest government figures up until the end of September, which don't include Mrs Brown's payout, show that of 492 eligible claimants, 385 have had their claims fully settled – with more than 100 people still waiting for their final payment.Across all the government compensation schemes, £1.2bn has now been paid out to more than 9,100 victims.\"This is a redress scheme,\" Mrs Brown stressed. \"They've only given us back what they took from us. We haven't had a penny in compensation.\"Over the last two years, that's the message Mrs Brown has been putting across as she's become one of the most formidable campaigners for justice for former sub-postmasters.She has appeared on BBC Breakfast, Newsnight and taken government ministers to task.Mrs Brown celebrated with tea and cake at her local church coffee morning. She got a round of applause and some hugs as she broke the news of her final payout.Mrs Brown also made it clear that she was not finished.\"I don't want to put my feet up,\" she said. \"I just want the other sub-postmasters to have what I have been given. That's all I want – justice for every one of them.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterM&S's profits were almost wiped out after it was hit by a cyber-attack which left shoppers unable to buy online from the company for months.The food and fashion chain's boss said the April attack was \"an extraordinary moment in time\" and revealed that its statutory profit before tax - the figure that takes in to account all costs for a period - was down 99% for the first half of the year, compared with the year prior.It made just £3.4m in the six months to September, down from £391.9m for the same period last year.As well as disrupting its online business, the hack affected the company in-store too, leaving some shelves bare in the weeks after M&S was targeted.M&S said it had received £100m of insurance money related to combating the cyber-attack, around the amount which the incident had cost it so far, though it expects further costs in the coming months.In another measure of profit which strips out costs from unusual events, it made £184m for the first half of the year, compared with £413m the year prior.The fashion and food company was forced to suspend online orders for almost two months, with click and collect suspended for almost four months.Revealing its financial figures for the six months to September, M&S said \"the underlying strength\" of the chain meant it was \"getting back on track\" and expected full-year profits to be in-line with last year.One analyst told BBC's Today programme that it was reassuring that the main part of M&S's business, homewares and fashion, only saw sales decline around 16%.\"Given that they were offline for most of the trading period and really only came back online for their click and collect in August, it's pretty, pretty resilient,\" said Judith MacKenzie, head of Downing Fund Managers.She said it was \"outstanding\" that its food sales were up 7.8% over that time despite it being \"a pretty horrendous period\" for the company.The fact that costs related to the attack were lower than expected was positive, said Lucy Rumbold, equity research analyst at Quilter.M&S had earlier estimated that the attack would cost it around £300m.On a call after the results, chief executive Stuart Machin said: \"in May, we anticipated the material impact of the incident on group operating profit to be around £300m this financial year, and we are broadly in line with that\".He said there were costs from managing the impact, including more IT staffing, and increased food wastage as the firm switched to manual processing during the cyber attack.Ms Rumbold said there was a view from investors that the disruption caused by the hack \"was a one-off\".\"Normal trading can therefore resume and the positive story M&S had going prior to the cyber-attack remains in place.\"M&S said in the second half of the year it forecast profits would recover to the levels seen in 2024, \"as the residual effects of the incident continue to reduce in the coming months.\"Mr Machin said the firm was looking forward to a profitable Christmas period, and said sales were going well of its much-loved rose mulled wine, and men's washable tuxedos.While profits at M&S tumbled, other retailers have seen a boost in sales as people turned to them for shopping after the cyber attack.Next continued to see sales overperform, with its latest results in October seeing a 10.5% increase in sales. However, that was not as good as earlier in the year when it had seen \"exceptional performance\" in the immediate aftermath of the M&S cyber attack.",

    "body": "Investigators have boarded an Australian cruise ship more than 10 days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind on a remote island.Suzanne Rees, 80, had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her, only returning several hours later when the crew realised Ms Rees was missing.Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) boarded the vessel on Wednesday morning local time.Amsa, which is probing the incident alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner, told the BBC it could not comment on the investigation.The 60-day cruise around Australia, which had cost guests tens of thousands of dollars, was cancelled due to Ms Rees' death as well as mechanical issues.The Coral Adventurer had been expected to dock at Cairns – where its operator Coral Expeditions is based.But a lack of available berths meant it instead dropped anchor a few kilometres north early on Tuesday evening, off the coast of Yorkey's Knob, where it remained on Wednesday morning.The BBC understands only a skeleton crew were on board.Ship tracking data showed one of the vessel's smaller boats, known as a tender, moving between the ship and the shore on Tuesday night.All passengers disembarked at Horn Island in the far north of Queensland over the weekend and were transferred to the mainland on a charter plane.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast.Tracking data shows the vessel initially left Cairns at around 07:30 local time on 24 October - after a delay of around a week because of mechanical issues.The next day it reached Lizard Island - also known as Jiigurru or Dyiigurra - in the northern area of the Great Barrier Reef for the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard were transported by tenders to the secluded island – home to a luxury resort and a research station - for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said last week that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother, who was from Sydney,  as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"A search and rescue effort late on Saturday 25 October – the day she went missing – did not find any sign of Ms Rees. Her body was discovered the following day.Last week Mark Fifield, the chief executive of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, confirmed the firm was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".Mr Fifield said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHazel ShearingEducation correspondentGetty ImagesChildren will be taught how to budget and how mortgages work as the government seeks to modernise the national curriculum in England's schools.They will also be taught how to spot fake news and disinformation, including AI-generated content, following the first review of what is taught in schools in over a decade.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the government wanted to \"revitalise\" the curriculum but keep a \"firm foundation\" in basics like English, maths and reading.Head teachers said the review's recommendations were \"sensible\" but would require \"sufficient funding and teachers\".The changes come after the government commissioned a review of the national curriculum and assessments in England last year, in the hope of developing a \"cutting edge\" curriculum that would narrow attainment gaps between the most disadvantaged students and their classmates.It said it would take up most of the review's recommendations, including scrapping the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), a progress measure for schools introduced in 2010.The EBacc assesses schools based on how many pupils take English, maths, sciences, geography or history and a language - and how well they do.The Department for Education (DfE) said the measure was \"constraining\", and that removing it alongside reforms to another school ranking system, Progress 8, would \"encourage students to study a greater breadth of GCSE subjects\", such as arts.Other reforms coming as a result of the curriculum review include:Financial literacy being taught in maths classes, or compulsory citizenship lessons in primary schoolsMore focus on spotting misinformation and disinformation - including exploring a new post-16 qualification in data science and AICutting time spent on GCSE exams by up to three hours for each student on averageEnsuring all children can take three science GCSEsMore content on climate changeBetter representation of diversityThe review also recommended giving oracy the same status in the curriculum as reading and writing, which the charity Voice 21 said was a \"vital step forward\" for teaching children valuable speaking, listening, and communication skills.Asked what lessons would be removed from the school day, Phillipson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would not be a case of swapping out content for new topics but that there would be \"better sequencing\" of the curriculum overall.\"We need to ensure that we avoid duplication so that children aren't repeating the things that they might have already studied,\" she added.However, the government is not taking up all of the review's recommendations.It is pushing ahead with the reading tests for Year 8 pupils reported in September, whereas the review recommended compulsory English and maths tests for that year group.Asked why she stopped short of taking up the review's recommendation, Phillipson said that pupils who are unable to read \"fluently and confidently\" often struggle in other subjects.And she addressed the claims that scrapping the EBacc could lead to fewer pupils taking history, geography and languages at GCSE, saying the measure \"hasn't led to improved outcomes\" or \"improvement in language study\".\"I want young people to have a good range of options, including subjects like art and music and sport. And I know that's what parents want as well,\" she said.She said ministers recognised \"the need to implement this carefully, thoroughly and with good notice\", adding that schools would have four terms of notice before being expected to teach the new curriculum.Prof Becky Francis, who chaired the review, said her panel of experts and the government had both identified a \"problem\" pupils experience during the first years of secondary school.\"When young people progress from primary into secondary school, typically this is a time when their learning can start falling behind, and that's particularly the case for kids from socially disadvantaged backgrounds,\" she told the BBC.Professor Becky Francis led the curriculum and assessment reviewShe said the approach to the review was \"evolution not revolution\", with England's pupils already performing relatively well against international averages. She said the call for more representation of diversity in the curriculum was not about \"getting rid of core foundational texts and things that are really central to our culture\", but was more about \"recognising where, both as a nation but also globally, there's been diverse contribution to science and cultural progress\".Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the changes \"leave children with a weaker understanding of our national story and hide standards slipping in schools\".\"Education vandalism will be the lasting legacy of the prime minister and Bridget Phillipson,\" she added.The former Conservative schools minister, Nick Gibb, said the decision to scrap the EBacc would \"lead to a precipitous decline in the study of foreign languages\", which he said would become increasingly centred on private schools and \"children of middle class parents who can afford tutors\".The Liberal Democrats have welcomed the broadening of the curriculum, but said \"scrapping instead of broadening the EBacc is not the right move.\"Education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said head teachers were having to \"cut their budgets to the bone\" and would be asking how they are supposed to fund the changes.\"Without a costed plan and proper workforce strategy, these reforms will stretch teachers even further and fail our children,\" she said.Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the review had proposed \"a sensible, evidence-based set of reforms\".But he said delivering a \"great curriculum\" also required \"sufficient funding and teachers\", adding that schools and colleges did not currently have all the resources they need.He said a set of \"enrichment benchmarks\" - which the government said would offer pupils access to civic engagement, arts and culture, nature and adventure, sport, and life skills - had been announced \"randomly\" and \"added to the many expectations over which schools are judged\".Additional reporting by Hope Rhodes",

    "body": "12 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondent Getty ImagesHuman error could have led to criminal cases involving alleged grooming gangs being dropped, the early stages of a massive review have found.Operation Beaconport - a National Crime Agency project tasked with unearthing failings to tackle grooming gangs - is set to look at thousands of cases where police forces and the Crown Prosecution Service decided to take no further action against suspects.Police say that there appear to be cases where lines of inquiry were not pursued properly, victim accounts were not taken, and suspects were not interviewed as they should have been.Investigations that were wrongly closed with no further action taken have already been discovered.\"Initial reviews have identified that in some cases where there has been a decision to take no further action, there were available lines of inquiry that could have been pursued\", said the National Crime Agency's deputy director Nigel Leary.\"We've seen in those cases what appears to be potentially human error. \"We've seen in some cases that those investigations haven't followed what we would characterise as proper investigative practice, actually that would have contributed to the no further action decision,\" Mr Leary added. The issue of grooming gangs has made headlines in recent months - with a national inquiry into the issue in England and Wales thrown into turmoil by disagreements before it had even got under way.Operation Beaconport is a national policing operation led by the NCA and was set up earlier this year in a bid to eliminate inconsistencies in how cases are handled by police forces. It is reviewing cases between January 2010 and March 2025.It is not clear how much the operation will cost or how long it will take.Getty ImagesSo far, 1,273 cases relating to allegations of group-based child sexual abuse and exploitation identified by 23 police forces have been referred to the investigation team. Of these, 236 relate to allegations of rape, which Operation Beaconport is reviewing as a priority.The NCA expects the operation to involve thousands of officers from across policing, with Mr Leary claiming it will be \"the most comprehensive investigation of its type in UK history\".In response to the review's early findings, the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"The grooming gangs scandal was one of the darkest moments in this country's history.\"This government initiated this national policing operation to track down the evil child rapists that perpetrated these crimes, and put them behind bars where they belong.\"As part of the review, the ethnicity of suspects and victims will be recorded. Officers admit to finding gaps in the existing data that they are trying to fill. They will also aim to flag dangerous suspects, and any that are at risk of fleeing the country.The NCA says better data sharing between multi-agency teams and more coordinated efforts to track and disrupt offenders will also be developed to help them tackle these crimes more effectively.The investigation into grooming gangs and other non-familial sexual abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, cost £89m over 11 years.Last month, the Metropolitan Police announced it was reviewing 9,000 cases of child sexual exploitation.It is likely that some of these cases will be checked by Operation Beaconport, which is looking at cases involving two or more suspects. It will also focus on allegations where there have been multiple victims, the suspects are still alive, and the case has not already been independently reviewed.The review will run alongside the national public inquiry, announced by the government earlier this year.Richard Fewkes from the National Police Chiefs' Council said that some victims will just want to feel listened too. \"Justice means different things for different victims and survivors, and no one victim and survivor is the same.\"For some, justice is just being believed, perhaps for the first time, by someone in authority, being listened to,\" he said. Last month, a watchdog said that while police forces had made significant progress in tracking grooming gangs and child exploitation, \"significant challenges\" remained. Inconsistent definitions, data accuracy issues and poor national co-ordination risk undermining efforts to protect vulnerable children, His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services said in a progress report.It found only 37% of child exploitation cases were accurately flagged on police systems, with opportunities to protect children still being missed.A Home Office spokeswoman said the inspectorate's report showed \"important progress\" had been made but acknowledged there was \"more to do\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philip said the Home Office's failure to adopt a definition for group-based child sexual exploitation was keeping \"the system blind to patterns of abuse\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorThe 'godmother' of AI, Professor Fei-Fei Li has told the BBC that being the only woman amongst seven pioneers of artificial Intelligence being presented with a top engineering prize by the King today makes her \"proud to be different\".The King will present the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Prof Li and six others during a ceremony at St James's Palace.  Those honoured alongside her are Prof Yoshua Bengio, Dr Bill Dally, Dr Geoffrey Hinton, Prof John Hopfield, Nvidia founder Jensen Huang and Meta's Chief AI Scientist Dr Yann LeCun.They are being recognised for their contributions to the development of modern machine learning, a field that underpins the rapid advancement of AI.Dr Hinton, Prof Bengio and Yann LeCun, currently Chief AI Scientist at Meta have widely been recognised as the \"Godfathers of AI\" since they were jointly awarded the 2018 Turing Award.  There is however only one so-called \"godmother\" of AI and Prof Li told the BBC she has grown to accept the moniker.\"I would not call myself godmother of anything,\" she said.  She said a few years ago when people started calling her that, she had to \"pause and recognise if I rejected this, it would miss an opportunity for women scientists and technologists to be recognised this way\".\"Because men are pretty easily called godfathers or founding fathers.\"\"For all the young women I work with and the generations of girls to come, I'm okay now accepting this title,\" she added.Born in China, Prof Li emigrated to the US as a teenager and went on to excel in computer science. She is co-director for Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute and co-founder and CEO of World Labs.It is her work on ImageNet a project which enabled major advances in computer vision for which she is recognised. She and her students created large-scale image recognition datasets upon which a lot of artificial intelligence technology is now built. It paved the way for computer vision – working out how computers could 'see'.She says the importance of that data set \"open the floodgate of data-driven AI\".She thinks the next AI milestone will come when it is able to interact with the world around it.This ability was is \"innately important and native to animals and humans\", and if this could be unlocked in AI, it could \"superpower\" humans in many ways, \"including creativity, robotic learning, design and architecture\".This will be the first time all seven laureates have come together in person. The three \"godfathers\" have publicly stated opposing views on how dangerous AI could be. Dr Hinton has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the potential for AI to pose an \"extinction-level threat\".  But Prof LeCun, who also works at Meta has written that apocalyptic warnings are overblown.Prof Li says she takes a more \"pragmatic approach\" and says the disagreement amongst scientists is \"healthy\".\"We're used to even disagreement, and I think that's healthy. A topic as profound and impactful as AI requires a lot of healthy debate and public discourse.\"I think in the case of AI, both extreme rhetorics concern me…I have always advocated for a much more science based, pragmatic method in communicating and educating the public.\"So, yes, I would like to see our communication of AI to be much more moderated and grounded in facts and science instead of the extreme rhetorics\".The Queen Elizabeth prize is awarded annually to engineers responsible for groundbreaking innovations which globally benefit humanity. Previous recipients include Sir Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web.Lord Vallance, chair of the Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering Foundation, said the winners \"represent the very best of engineering,\" adding that their work \"demonstrates how engineering can both sustain our planet and transform the way we live and learn.\"Additional reporting by Philippa Wain",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterShares of major technology companies have fallen over fears about the valuations of firms linked to the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.Investors have grown increasing wary about what they are calling an \"AI bubble\" this year that has seen tech stock valuations hit record highs. Major indexes in Asia were the hardest hit on Wednesday, following a sell-off in the US. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 2.5%, dragged lower by tech investment giant, SoftBank, which plunged more than 10%.AI valuation concerns took hold in the US as well after it was revealed the trader who inspired The Big Short has bet $1.1bn (£840m) on a fall in prices for AI-related stocks Nvidia and Palantir.Hedge fund investor Michael Burry, who was played by actor Christian Bale in the 2015 film The Big Short, a film about traders who made millions from predicting the collapse of the US housing bubble in 2008, has turned his attention to AI.Mr Burry's company revealed it has bought financial products, called options, that will pay out if the price of AI-linked companies Nvidia and Palatir shares fall.It comes after the trader posted on X: \"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\"Markets worldwide have climbed in over the year as investors placed their chips in companies linked to AI, including Nvidia, Intel and AMD.\"It seems fatigue over AI and the current earnings run has investors questioning the sustainability of the AI hype. That's dragged down AI companies overnight in markets,\" said financial analyst Farhan Badami.Many jumps in tech shares have been linked to major investments in firms. For instance, Amazon shares hit an all-time high on Monday after the announcement of a $38bn deal with OpenAI.But the shares of many tech firms fell on Wednesday. Amazon's stock dipped by 1.84% and notably, Nvidia - recently the first company to ever be valued at $5tn - dropped by close to 4%.SoftBank, one of Japan's largest firms, suffered one of steepest drop in shares. The fall weighed especially hard on Japan's Nikkei index.The investment firm has invested heavily in AI development, channelling billions into tech companies like OpenAI, Intel and other players in the sector.SoftBank's decline stems from the recent \"sharp rally\" in its shares, which investment analyst Vincent Fernando describes as a \"double-edged sword\". The surge can attract investors, but also leaves the stock vulnerable to pullbacks whenever market sentiments shift, he said.\"The market can worry if the company is overspending on AI and won't make a sufficient return on that spend,\" said Mr Fernando from investment consultancy Zero One.Tech shares also took a hit elsewhere in Asia. South Korea's Samsung fell by more than 4% while the country's stock exchange index, the Kospi, was down by 2.85%.TSMC, which makes semiconductors for Nvidia, was fell nearly 3%.Mr Badami from financial services firm eToro believes the correction among tech stocks will continue over the next year.\"Investors seem to be feeling that some of the super-high valuations out there aren't making sense, and AI enthusiasm has definitely fuelled those stretched valuations.\"Spending within AI-focused tech firms has been \"really high, and for some companies, they are not making enough money to justify the spending,\" said Mr Badami.",

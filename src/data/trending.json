On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents.

    "body": "35 minutes agoRachel Muller HeyndykandChi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondentNews SyndicationThe former prince, Andrew, left, has been criticised for his association with Jeffrey EpsteinEmails suggest that the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein invited a man believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman.The latest batch of documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein shows emails signed \"A\", with a signature that appears to read \"HRH Duke of York KG\".The emails were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The messages are likely to put further pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The emails between Epstein and an account named \"The Duke\" on 11 and 12 August 2010 suggest that the American wanted to introduce \"A\" to a 26-year-old Russian woman, whom Epstein suggests he \"might enjoy having dinner with\".He says that the woman would be in London in August 2010. \"The Duke\" replies that he would be in Geneva \"until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her\" before asking: \"Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\"He asks Epstein whether there is \"any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?\"Epstein replies that \"she [is] 26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email\".The late financier was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010, a month before the email exchange. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the emails.Also among the latest tranche of documents is an email exchange dated 27 September 2010 between Epstein and the account titled \"The Duke\". The address itself is redacted.Epstein writes that he is in London, adding: \"What time woudl [sic] you like me and [redacted], we will also need/ have private time\".\"The Duke\" replies: \"I am just departing Scotland should be down by 1800. I'll ring you when I get down if you can give me a number to ring. Alternatively we could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy. A\".Epstein replies: \"bp pleease [sic].\"The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to\" Epstein's arrest and conviction.Mountbatten-Windsor has faced allegations, which he repeatedly denied, that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre as a teenager after she said she was trafficked by Epstein.He paid a financial settlement to Giuffre, who he claims to have never met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022.The newly released email exchanges form part of more than three million pages of documents made public on Friday by the US justice department. More than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images are included in the latest batch. Their release comes six weeks after a deadline mandated in a law signed by President Donald Trump.Many of the documents are heavily redacted, with some files showing pages which are entirely blacked-out.",

    "body": "Image source, EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockByShireen JordanBBC WeatherUpdated 7 hours agoStargazers may be able to catch the last full Moon of meteorological winter on Sunday. If you're tempted to pop outside to catch a glimpse, it will rise at 16:13 GMT in London and should be visible - clouds permitting - until it sets at 08:06 GMT on 2 February. These timings vary slightly depending on where in the UK you are.A full Moon happens when the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of Earth - in alignment, known as 'syzygy' - so the whole side that is facing us is illuminated. It also appears to look full in the days before and after the peak, so there will be other opportunities to see it, if you don't catch it on Sunday. Image source, BBC Weather Watcher/ Dave's PatchImage caption, Last year the Snow Moon was visible in the night sky on Valentine's DayWhy is it called a Snow Moon?Full Moons were historically named as a way of keeping track of the change of seasons and often influenced the timing of activities like hunting, harvesting and planting, where the bright moonlight could come in handy. Each full Moon in a year has a name - a practice that dates back to ancient traditions centuries before the Gregorian calendar existed.February's full Moon is known as the Snow Moon, after the heavy snowfall often associated with this time of year in the northern hemisphere, but is also sometimes called the Storm Moon or Hungry Moon.Image source, BBC Weather Watcher/ AstroMalImage caption, January's Wolf Moon captured by BBC Weather Watcher 'AstroMal' over Crystal Palace, London Will I be able to see the full Moon?Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / YorkshireTedImage caption, A bright orange supermoon shines over Yorkshire There is quite a lot of cloud in the forecast for Saturday and Sunday night, with the best of any clear spells likely to be across Northern Ireland.The Moon will be at its peak illumination at 10:09 GMT in the UK when it is below the horizon, however it will still appear 'full' when it rises at night and for the following few days. Sunday will see a largely cloudy day with patchy rain in places, mainly the north and east and just a few brighter breaks between these.If you manage to spot the Moon and want to take a picture make sure you turn off the flash on your phone, activate night mode and use ambient light. Oh, and check the BBC Weather forecast.The lunar monthImage source, Matt Cardy/Getty ImagesImage caption, The Snow Moon in February 2023 was the smallest one of the year making it a Micromoon - the opposite of a supermoon This year there will be an extra full Moon on 31 May, known as a Blue Moon. This is the name given to the second full Moon in a calendar month. May's Blue Moon will also be one of three Micromoons this year. Micromoons appear to look smaller in the sky and are the opposite of a supermoon.We usually get 12 full Moons a year, but as this doesn't quite match up with the lunar cycle we get an additional one roughly every two and half years. As it only happens every few years it is where the expression 'once in a blue moon' comes from.",

    "body": "12 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBBCAlan Carr was selected to be a traitor on the BBC series, along with Cat Burns (pictured) and Jonathan RossComedian Alan Carr has revealed he accidentally gave away that he had won the Celebrity Traitors, just 12 hours after filming the final episode. The 49-year-old won the first celebrity series after convincing fellow finalists Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga that he was a faithful in a nail-biting final.But, he told BBC Radio 2's Scott Mills, the secret slipped out when he was filming Channel 4 gameshow Secret Genius the following day. Carr explained: \"The cameraman goes 'congratulations', and I go 'how did you know I won?' He said 'I didn't.\"\"So I told them within 12 hours that I had won The Traitors.\"After Carr inadvertently revealed he had won, the camera operator explained he had been \"just joking, just teasing\".The comedian then tried to retract his comment about winning, and said: \"I went, 'haha, got you!' - I had to backtrack, because you can't tell anything.\"But I did well, and I didn't want to spoil it.\"Carr told Radio 2's Scott Mills on Friday that he \"felt so stupid\" after inadvertently revealing he had wonBoth the regular and celebrity series of The Traitors are filmed months before they are broadcast - with the cast and crew required to follow strict confidentiality rules. The celebrity version of the show saw Carr appear alongside Sir Stephen Fry, Kate Garraway and Celia Imrie, as well as his fellow traitors Cat Burns and Jonathan Ross. Speaking about accidentally revealing the ending, Carr told Radio 2: \"I felt so stupid. When I did The Traitors, I looked at my work diary and my agent had actually put in work after the first week, and I said 'oh no, I'm doing The Traitors'.\"He said, 'Alan, you'll be out first week with your motor mouth, you aren't going to last'. Then it kept going on and on.\"He added: \"I thought I would be gone on day two.\"However, the comedian remained largely under the radar during his time on the show, and was eventually crowned the winner.'Who are you going to murder today?'Carr also said that, since appearing on Celebrity Traitors, he has been recognised more in public.The comedian recently went on holiday to Mexico, explaining: \"I'm never spotted over there.\"I was on the way to the pool and I heard this woman from the balcony, 'I see you, traitor. Don't you hide your face from me. Who are you going to murder today?\"'He joked the comments made him look like a real murderer, and said: \"People who don't know I was in The Traitors must think I'm a serial killer.\"Hosted by Claudia Winkleman, The Traitors follows a group of contestants - the majority of whom are known as the faithful - as they try to seek out the murderous traitors among them who kill off players every night in an attempt to win a cash prize.Set in the Scottish Highlands, the contestants complete a number of challenges to win money for the prize pot and must try to root out and banish the traitors at a roundtable discussion each night.The first series of the show's celebrity spin-off was a huge ratings success for the BBC, reaching more than 15 million viewers (including catch-up viewing) when it concluded last November.Carr presents his new series, Secret Genius, alongisde Susie Dent. The show begins on Sunday and Channel 4 says it is intended to \"spotlight the country's undiscovered brainboxes\".",

The Belgian then took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five set contest and he had a match dart after hitting two treble 20s when attempting a 142 check-out but he missed double 11 with his third arrow.World number one Littler hit double 16 with his next dart to level the match and then opened with 180 on his way to taking the deciding set.Littler called it a \"tough\" night, adding on ITV: \"I didn't get going. \"In the second and third set, Mike deserved to win them.\"I had to fight back and that's what I did. I got over the line, found a bit of form and got the win.\"The tournament favourite's win sets up a last-16 showdown with Ross Smith.Littler was followed on to the stage by defending champion Luke Humphries, who averaged 104 as he defeated Dave Chisnall 3-1.Humphries, the 2024 world champion, lost the first set but went on to hit seven 180s.The night's final match saw Stephen Bunting beat Jeffrey de Graaf 3-1.Day two of the competition also saw wins for Josh Rock, Luke Woodhouse, Danny Noppert and Rob Cross.Friday's resultsStephen Bunting 3-1 Jeffrey de GraafLuke Humphries 3-1 Dave ChisnallLuke Littler 3-2 Mike de DeckerJosh Rock 3-1 Connor ScuttLuke Woodhouse 3-0 Martin SchindlerRoss Smith 3-1 Jimmy van SchieDanny Noppert 3-1 Daryl GurneyRob Cross 3-1 Ryan Searle",

    "body": "2 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of the death penalty.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum punishment of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" Agnifilo said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Judge Garnett, a Biden appointee, said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the Mangione case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Father-of-two Thompson, 50, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail where he is being held. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "'We hope it's not the end': Firm behind Prince George's baby shoes warns it may close11 hours agoJemma CrewBusiness reporterGetty ImagesPrince George pictured wearing the Early Days leather baby shoes in New Zealand in 2014The firm behind baby shoes worn by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis is at risk of shutting down, its owner has warned. Paul Bolton said his Leicester factory producing Early Days and Baypod shoes is likely to close, with the company having been hit \"from all angles\" with a slump in customer demand and a sharp rise in business costs. Despite its royal customers causing an explosion in sales, he said the 73-year-old business is on the brink of collapse. Bolton, who runs the family business with his brother, has said they can no longer afford it and are hoping to find a buyer. Announcing the decision on LinkedIn, Bolton said: \"The decision to wind down the company comes in response to ongoing increases in overheads and the challenging state of both the UK and overseas economies over the past three years.\"We are exploring interest from various parties and welcome all enquiries.\"Early Days was started more than 70 years ago by Bolton's father and uncle out of their parents' home. Bolton and his brother have tried to keep the firm in business, but he said he can no longer afford to pump in money to keep it afloat. Speaking on BBC Radio 5's Wake Up To Money show, he recalled the company's \"marvellous\" trading period after Prince George was photographed wearing the shoes during a tour of Australasia. Bolton was forced to suspend online sales for a few days due to stock selling out, describing it as \"a remarkable time\". \"The factory was on overtime, and it opened a lot of new accounts. People hadn't heard of us before, so they wanted to stock Early Days shoes.\"The publicity translated into the company's usual annual turnover doubling, he said.But, following its best year in 2022, Early Days saw a slowing down in orders from shoe shops, with former customers citing the increasingly tough conditions on the high street.  Bolton also said the firm was hit by rising energy and materials costs, as well as increases in the minimum wage and employer National Insurance Contributions. It is the latest firm to complain about the increasing tax burden and wage bill since Labour came to power in 2024. \"It's just been hitting us from all angles, so we've had prices going up, but demand going down because of the consumer spending [which is] down,\" Bolton said. Paul BoltonPrincess Charlotte has been photographed wearing the 'Emma' shoe in pinkThe firm was forced to hike the price of some of its shoes, he said. Their budget shoes currently start from £12.99, while the premium leather range - worn by the royal siblings - are priced at £32 a pair.The company, which once employed over 100 people and produced more than 10,000 pairs of shoes a week, is down to just 10 employees.Bolton and his brother have been propping the firm up with their own money, but he said they \"just can't do it anymore\".He continued: \"We hope it's not the end, but I'd say it's 80% likely it is.\"But we have got a lot of inquiries. Some are going to be, we hope, to perhaps invest, keep the company going over here. \"But we think some of the other inquiries, we think it's probably to move it overseas, which we've never wanted to do.\"A government spokesperson said: \"The Budget doubled down on our work to grow the economy and create good jobs, and we are delivering stability, cutting borrowing and getting inflation down.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoIsabella Allen,Politics producer in ShanghaiandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersSeven new shops for Labubu dolls are to open in the UK this year, following the prime minister's trip to China.Chinese toy maker Pop Mart has confirmed it will open a flagship shop on Oxford Street in London's West End, as well as shops in Cardiff and Birmingham, before opening 20 more shops in Europe in 2026.The announcement is part of a package of deals announced by the UK government, including on whisky and cars, which officials claim is worth £2.2bn in export deals.Some have expressed concerns about Sir Keir's visit to China, arguing the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.Labubus are furry dolls wearing a signature spiky-toothed grin and became a viral purchase last summer, with celebrity fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian.The legions of fans are happy to queue to snap up the dolls, although to many their appeal is hard to explain. But their popularity has been a boon to Chinese soft power, with state news agency Xinhua saying Labubu \"shows the appeal of Chinese creativity, quality and culture in a language the world can understand\".Pop Mart founder Grant Wang, who expects to bring 150 new jobs to the UK, said: \"London stands at the heart of the global creative ecosystem, and we are thrilled to plant our European roots here.\"Sir Keir has made the first trip to China by a UK prime minister for eight years in an effort to thaw relations and cement trade deals with the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.On the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing, he announced an estimated  £2.2bn in export deals, as well as new investment.This includes a cut in tariffs on Scottish whisky exports to China, estimated to be worth £250m to the UK economy over the next five years, which will come into force on Monday.The prime minister also met the chairman of car manufacturer Chery, who confirmed the company will open a European headquarters in Liverpool.However, the Conservatives have argued Sir Keir's trip was not in the national interest and Reform UK has called on him to reject trade deals with China until British citizen Jimmy Lai is released from prison.Responding to critics, Sir Keir said: \"Engaging with China, is how we secure growth for British businesses, support good jobs at home, and protect our national security.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoEleanor LawsonWest MidlandsFamily / British Transport PoliceRhiannon Whyte was stabbed 23 times with a screwdriverAn asylum seeker has been jailed for life for the murder of a woman who worked at the hotel at which he was staying.Deng Majek stabbed Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver in a frenzied 90-second attack in 2024 after following the 27-year-old to Bescot Stadium railway station in Walsall. He was later caught on CCTV dancing and laughing. As Majek was handed a minimum term of 29 years at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, his victim's mother wiped away tears.Siobhan Whyte read out a statement at the hearing, her hands shaking as she looked directly at Majek - a Sudanese national - to say: \"I hope you never see the outside world again. Let me see you dancing now.\"She told the court it was \"impossible to fully explain the pain I'm feeling\", adding her late daughter had also been her best friend.\"Because of Majek's inexplicable, cruel and brutal actions, we must face life without her,\" she said.\"To some extent my life also ended that day. She had no chance, no say in how her life would be decided. You took that from all of us.\"PA MediaMajek was recorded on CCTV dancing and laughing after murdering Rhiannon Whyte Rhiannon Whyte had just finished her shift at the Park Inn Hotel at 23:00 BST on 20 October 2024 and was on the phone to a friend as she walked to the railway station.She was on the platform when Majek launched his attack, stabbing her 19 times in the head, with 11 injuries to her skull, and one wound so deep it pierced her brain stem. She died in hospital three days later. No motive has been established for why Majek attacked her.Majek had arrived in the UK on a small boat about three months before the attack and made a legal claim for asylum. He was living at the hotel, which was being used to temporarily house asylum seekers at the time.Rhiannon Whyte's mother Siobhan Whyte said her family had also received a life sentenceOutside court, Siobhan Whyte said she was \"pleased\" with the sentence but added that her family had \"a life sentence too\" because of Majek's actions.\"I will hate him till the day I take my last breath,\" she said, before adding that love for her daughter was stronger.Referencing Majek's immigration status, she urged the government to take tougher action.\"It's always the undocumented illegal immigrants that are doing this, and it's not fair, they're taking over our country,\" she said.\"The government needs to stand up and start doing something about it. To stop this pain.\"Rhiannon Whyte's sister Alex Whyte also spoke on Friday. She told the sentencing hearing in a victim impact statement how she was now raising her late sister's son, saying it was \"unimaginably difficult\" to explain to him his mother had died.\"It is no exaggeration to say that his screams will haunt me forever,\" she said.She added that her nephew wanted to be a \"brain doctor\" so he could save people with injuries like those of his mother.She had previously described Majek as a \"sick, twisted and cowardly human\".Outside court there were anti-immigration protesters, including far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who left shortly after the sentence was delivered, having addressed some of the crowd.Video shown to the trial jury showed Deng Majek dancing after Rhiannon Whyte's deathThe judge Mr Justice Soole said Whyte had tried to defend herself \"with the greatest courage\" against Majek's \"frenzied and sustained brutality\".She was found on a deserted platform minutes after the attack by a member of railway staff from the train on which Whyte had intended to travel home.The court heard how Majek took Whyte's phone and turned it off, before walking calmly away and throwing the device into a river. He then took a long walk around Walsall and bought beer, with CCTV footage showing him dancing and laughing in the car park of the hotel.During sentencing, the judge told Majek that there had been \"chilling composure in every aspect of your behaviour\".Alex Whyte (centre) is raising her bereaved nephew - she is pictured here after Majek's conviction in OctoberBefore the hearing, the judge had ordered an age assessment report to be drawn up due to uncertainties over how old Majek was.Majek himself had claimed to be 19, despite documents - filled in during a failed asylum claim in Germany - suggesting he was 27.Sentencing guidelines are different for children under 18, but the guidance to judges reads \"many of the principles will also be relevant to sentencing young adults (aged 18-25)\".  The assessment report later concluded Majek was over the age of 21, with the judge saying he believed the defendant to be between the ages of 25 and 28.The trial had heard how Whyte's blood was found on clothes, shoes and a ring worn by Majek.When he was asked during those proceedings why he had her DNA under his right fingernail, he replied: \"I never touched her, and there is no DNA.\"The jury did not believe his evidence.

    "body": "8 hours agoJosh ParryLGBT & Identity ReporterGetty ImagesManchester Pride will go ahead this year under new management, after the company previously running the event went bust.The future of the celebration had looked uncertain after Manchester Pride Events LTD collapsed in October, owing more than £1m to suppliers and performers.Manchester City Council have announced that a new not-for-profit community interest company (CIC), Manchester Village Pride, will take over running the four-day event.The company, which will be run by volunteer directors, says the core elements of Pride will return, including the parade, village party and the annual vigil to those lost to HIV. Venues in the area have loaned the new organisation £120,000 to support the planning and delivery of the event.A spokesperson for Manchester Village Pride said it aims to \"give back as much as possible to the community that Pride exists to serve – with every pound of profit supporting LGBTQ+ charities, grassroots organisations and community services.\"As well as the main Manchester Pride event, there are plans to host a Pride Fringe  featuring LGBTQ+ arts, culture and nightlife events.The group are planning to introduce a Community Advisory Board made up of people from the LGBTQ+ community to ensure a range of perspectives are reflected in the planning of the event.Manchester City Council will also hold engagement sessions with LGBTQ+ organisations and representatives in order to gather a range of views.The council's deputy leader Cllr Garry Bridges said the council had \"always been clear\" that Pride should go ahead this year.He said: \"Pride is vital for Manchester, as a symbol of our welcoming and inclusive city, a chance to celebrate our LGBTQ+ communities and to highlight injustices which still exist.\"Carl Austin-Behan, one of the founders of Manchester Village Pride CIC, said the move was \"a chance to start again\". He added: \"Bringing Pride home to the Village is about more than location. \"It is a commitment to responsibility: paying artists properly, funding community groups, supporting charities, protecting LGBTQ+ heritage, and building a sustainable future for Pride in Manchester.\"The event will be the first in the UK to sign a union agreement with the performing arts and entertainment union Equity, after the collapse of the previous organisation left many performers unpaid.Karen Lockney, an official at Equity, said it would \"guarantee fair pay and professional industry standards for all performers\".She added: \"We have consistently called for unionised terms and conditions for Pride, and this positive development will restore the trust of our members in the event. \"They can be confident they will be paid and treated fairly in future.\"In 2021 more than 1,000 people attended a protest against what they saw as the over-commercialisation of Manchester PrideThere had been uncertainty about the future of Manchester Pride, after the previous organisers collapsed in October, owing £1.3m to artists, venues and suppliers.Over the past decade, Manchester Pride's previous organisers had attracted growing criticism from the community for raising ticket prices and for moving the main stage away from the city's Gay Village.In 2021, trustees launched a review looking at whether the organisation was meeting its purposes and aims after it cut funding for various LGBTQ+ charities.In the same year, it awarded its chief executive a £20,000 pay rise, leading to protests from members of the community.In 2025, the event drew criticism from performers and ticket holders who said its relaunched entertainment programme, hosted mainly in a venue outside of the Gay Village, failed to attract the usual large crowds.A statement from the former board of trustees said rising costs, declining ticket sales and its \"ambitious refresh of the format\" meant the organisation was no longer financially viable.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesandImogen Foulkes,Geneva correspondentGetty ImagesAntónio Guterres said the organisation's money could run out by JulyThe United Nations is at risk of \"imminent financial collapse\" due to member states not paying their fees, the body's head has warned.António Guterres said the UN faced a financial crisis which was \"deepening, threatening programme delivery\", and that money could run out by July.He wrote in a letter to all 193 member states that they had to honour their mandatory payments or overhaul the organisation's financial rules to avoid collapse.It comes after the UN's largest contributor, the US, refused to contribute to its regular and peacekeeping budgets, and withdrew from several agencies it called a \"waste of taxpayer dollars\". Several other members are in arrears or are simply refusing to pay.Though the UN General Assembly did approve a partial change to its financial system in late 2025, the organisation still faces a massive cash crisis compounded by a rule that means it is refunding money it never received.At its headquarters in Geneva, signs warning of the situation have been put up everywhere. In an almost desperate attempt to save cash, the escalators are regularly turned off and the heating turned down.Guterres wrote in his letter that the UN had faced financial crises in the past but that the current situation was \"categorically different\".\"Decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced,\" the secretary general said, without naming specific members.He said the \"integrity of the entire system\" depended on states adhering to their obligation under the UN charter to pay their \"assessed contributions\" - adding that 77% of the total owed had been paid in 2025, leaving a record amount unpaid.Guterres said a rule that the UN must return unspent money on particular programmes to members if it could not implement a budget created a \"double blow\" in which it was \"expected to give back cash that does not exist\".\"I cannot overstate the urgency of the situation we now face. We cannot execute budgets with uncollected funds, nor return funds we never received.\"As a result, the UN is now returning millions of dollars it never actually had. The letter reads: \"Just this month, as part of the 2026 assessment, we were compelled to return $227m [£165m]  – funds we have not collected.\"\"The bottom line is clear,\" Guterres wrote. \"Either all member states honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or member states must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse.\"UN agencies rarely get all the money they ask for to tackle humanitarian crises, but the past 12 months have been particularly difficult. The US is the UN's largest contributor, but President Donald Trump has said it was not fulfilling its \"great potential\" and has criticised it for failing to support US-led peace efforts.The US did not pay its contribution to the UN's regular budget in 2025 and offered only 30% of its expected funding to UN peacekeeping operations.Other countries, such as the UK and Germany, have also announced significant reductions in foreign aid, which will inevitably impact the UN's work.Guterres had warned earlier that same month that the UN faced its most fragile financial position in years - again citing unpaid fees - having said in October that it faced a \"race to bankruptcy\".Trump has separately been accused by critics of seeking to replace some functions of the UN with his Board of Peace to oversee regeneration efforts in Gaza.The US president has said its work would happen \"in conjunction with the United Nations\" - but when previously asked by a Fox TV journalist whether the board would take the UN's place, he replied: \"Well, it might.\"The US officially left the UN's World Health Organization last week. It had refused to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues despite, WHO lawyers say, being legally obliged to do so.Other agencies are also making huge cuts. The UN's human rights office has warned that serious violations will now go undocumented because it lacks the funds to deploy investigators. In the past, their evidence has led to prosecutions for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In Afghanistan, which has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world, UN Women has had to close mother and baby clinics. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme has had to cut rations to refugees fleeing the conflict in Sudan.",

    "body": "Just nowBrandon DrenonWatch: \"I will not be silenced\", says Don Lemon after arrestFormer CNN host Don Lemon appeared before a judge and was released from custody after being arrested for entering a Minnesota church and filming anti-immigration enforcement protesters as they disrupted a service.After appearing in court, Lemon told media outside that he was arrested for covering the news, adding: \"I will not be silenced.\"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Lemon was charged with \"conspiracy to deprive rights\" and \"violation of the FACE Act\", by allegedly interfering in someone's First Amendment rights by force.Lemon went into the Cities Church in St Paul on 18 January with protesters who said one of the pastors was an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official.Getty ImagesLemon, an independent journalist, said he was taken into custody by federal agents on Thursday. \"Last night the DOJ sent a team of federal agents to arrest me in the middle of the night for something that I have been doing for the last 30 years and that is covering the news,\" Lemon said. \"I have spent my entire covering the news. I will not stop now,\" Lemon added. \"In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment, for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable.\"Lemon has been charged with violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances and Places of Religious Worship (FACE) act, which is a law that typically has been used to crack down on demonstrations at abortion clinics but also prohibits obstructing access to houses of worship.US Department of Justice questioned over arrest of Don Lemon\"Don will fight these charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" his lawyer Abbe Lowell said earlier on Friday in a statement posted on Lemon's Instagram account. The lawyer added: \"This unprecedented attack on the First Amendment and transparent attempt to distract attention from the many crises facing this administration will not stand.\"Lowell said Lemon had been arrested while he was in Los Angeles covering the Grammy Awards.US Attorney General Pam Bondi said three others had been arrested: local independent journalist Georgia Fort, along with activists Trahem Jeen Crews and Jamael Lydell Lundy.Fort was also released earlier on Friday after her court appearance in Minnesota. America's top law enforcement official accused them of participating in a \"coordinated attack\" on the church. FBI Director Kash Patel said investigators from his agency and the DHS had arrested Lemon and the other three.Fort posted a livestream of federal agents arriving at her home to arrest her. \"Agents are at my door right now,\" she said in the clip. \"My children are here, they're impacted by this.\" President Donald Trump's administration initially sought to charge eight people involved in the Minnesota church protest with conspiring to deprive rights and interfering with someone's religious freedom in a house of worship.But a magistrate judge who reviewed the evidence approved charges for only three of those involved, excluding Lemon.The government challenged that decision, but an appeals court suggested prosecutors take the case to a federal grand jury - a panel of citizens that evaluates if there is enough evidence to charge someone in a case.A longstanding Trump critic, Lemon was fired from CNN in April 2023 after 17 years with the company. The morning show host had apologised for on-air comments that Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, then 51, was past her prime. In the Minnesota church protest, he live-streamed with anti-ICE protesters on YouTube. The broadcast began with Lemon standing with the group in a car park where he says: \"This is an operation that is secret.\"I can't tell you what is going to happen, but you're going to watch it live unfold here on 'The Don Lemon Show.'\"He followed the group - whom he called \"resistance protesters\" - into the church, initially without his camera operator. His microphone picked up audio of a woman shouting \"excuse me pastor\". Protesters chant \"Justice for Renee Good\", referring to the US citizen who was fatally shot in her vehicle on 7 January during a confrontation with an ICE officer in Minneapolis.Footage showed a chaotic scene unfolding inside the church, which belongs to the Southern Baptist Convention, as protesters and members of the congregation shout at each other. Lemon repeatedly says he is there as a journalist and is unaffiliated with demonstrators.\"We're not part of the activists, but we're here just reporting on them,\" he says.The pastor says: \"This is unacceptable, it's shameful. It's shameful to interrupt a public gathering of Christians in worship.\" Harmeet Dhillon, of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, said during an interview with podcaster Megyn Kelly on Friday: \"We're going to pursue this to the ends of the Earth.\"The White House appeared to celebrate the arrest, posting a photo of Lemon on its official X account with the caption \"when life gives you lemons\", next to an emoji of chain links.Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the detention of Lemon \"shocking\" and \"alarming.\"CNN said it raised \"profoundly concerning questions about press freedom and the First Amendment\". The network said it would follow Lemon's case closely.This is the second high-profile incident this month of the Trump administration investigating a journalist, raising the alarm of free speech advocates. On 14 January, the FBI showed up unannounced to the home of a Washington Post reporter with a search warrant and seized her devices over the alleged leak of classified information, although she herself was not charged with any crime.Protests are continuing in Minnesota, where an operation by federal immigration agents has sparked confrontations that have left two US citizens dead: Renee Good, a mother-of-three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse.",

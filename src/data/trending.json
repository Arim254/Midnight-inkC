    "body": "Scotland's mad for Oasis, Newcastle loves Sam Fender: Music tastes where you live revealed12 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterBBCOasis are big in Manchester, but even bigger in Scotland. Newcastle is wild for homegrown guitar hero Sam Fender, and Liverpool can't get enough of female pop stars.These are some of the revelations from a breakdown of listening habits on Spotify and YouTube in 2025 in more than a dozen of the UK's biggest cities.Taylor Swift and Drake were the clear winners on Spotify - except in Newcastle, where Fender broke their stranglehold. He was one of several artists to prove particularly popular in their hometown, while there was a clear north-south divide in Oasis's popularity as they reformed.Eminem dominated YouTube in 2025, ahead of the KPop Demon Hunters singers and Ed Sheeran - with Taylor, Drake and other pop giants also among the most played artists.But a number of surprises emerged from the lists, too. Here are the rankings for each of the featured cities:BelfastGetty ImagesLady Gaga's songs were played a million times in Belfast in 2025There's a lot of love for Lady Gaga in Northern Ireland's capital - she was the second most popular artist of 2025 on YouTube in Belfast, higher than in any other UK city.She was pipped to number one by the stars of KPop Demon Hunters, with Eminem in third. The rapper missed YouTube's top spot in just two of the 14 featured cities (the other being Nottingham).Belfast's most played artists on YouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaEminemTaylor SwiftBruno MarsEd SheeranRihannaSabrina CarpenterCalvin HarrisEJAESurprise package: Belfast trance producer Billy Gillies was just outside the top 10, in 12th, and had two tracks in the city's top 20 songs of the year on YouTube - DNA (Loving You) at 10 and Right Here All Along at 17.NB Spotify did not provide data for Belfast.BirminghamWireImage/Getty imagesThe Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar and Chris Brown are all big in BirminghamDrake is the most-played artist on Spotify in Birmingham, and it is the only place outside London to also have his rival Kendrick Lamar in its top five.Brummie fans are the most devoted to US R&B singer Chris Brown - it's the only place to put him in its top 10 on Spotify (at nine), and also gives him his highest YouTube placing (at eight).D-Block Europe are big in Birmingham, too - the London-based hip-hop duo are second only to Eminem on the list of the year's most-played artists on YouTube, and it's also the only city to have them in its Spotify top 20 (at 15).Birmingham's most played artists on Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestRihannaBillie EilishChris BrownSZABirmingham's most played artists on YouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeAlka YagnikEd SheeranDrakeKaran AujlaArijit SinghChris BrownKPop Demon Hunters castRihannaSurprise packages: A string of Indian singers are bigger than many Western superstars on YouTube in Birmingham - Alka Yagnik was the third most popular act of 2025 overall with more than 7.5 million views in the city (above Ed Sheeran and Drake).Shake It To The Max by Ghanaian singer Moliy and Jamaican producer Silent Addy was also massive - it was the third most viewed track of the year on YouTube, higher than in any of the other featured locations.BristolGetty Images for The Recording AcademyOlivia Dean's highest rating outside London The tastes of fans on Spotify and YouTube differ a lot, judging by their charts. As in many cities, Taylor Swift was most popular on Spotify in Bristol, while Eminem topped the YouTube list.Bristol's listeners are, according to these rankings, the biggest fans of Olivia Dean outside her home city London, placing her ninth on the Spotify chart.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOlivia DeanAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaRihannaThe WeekndBillie EilishEJAESurprise package: It's the only place with any of BTS star Jung Kook's songs in the top 20 Spotify tracks, and he has two (3D at number 13 and Seven at number 18).CardiffGetty Images/Netflix/Getty Images for iHeartRadioEminem, KPop Demon Hunters and Ed Sheeran topped Cardiff's YouTube chartAs well as being number one on YouTube, Eminem was more popular on Spotify in the Welsh capital than in any other city, in ninth.Ed Sheeran is third on YouTube, behind KPop Demon Hunters, and also has his highest Spotify ranking, in 11th in Cardiff.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaBillie EilishEminemTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaD-Block EuropeThe WeekndChris BrownSurprise package: It was big everywhere, but Benson Boone's Beautiful Things had its joint highest ranking on YouTube in Cardiff (in third), and the city was the only place to put the song in its Spotify top 10 tracks (at 10) in 2025.EdinburghGetty ImagesOasis, Gracie Abrams and Chappell Roan were all popular in Scotland's capitalAs Oasis reunion fever gripped the nation last year, Scotland went particularly mad fer it. The band were in the top five most-played acts on both Spotify and YouTube in both Edinburgh and Glasgow - higher than anywhere else, including their home city of Manchester.Edinburgh also likes its pop - it's the only city with Chappell Roan in its top 10 on Spotify, while superstar DJ David Guetta was higher on YouTube than anywhere else. Edinburgh and Glasgow are also the only cities to put Gracie Abrams in their Spotify top 20s.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarChappell RoanThe WeekndTate McRaeYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranOasisKPop Demon Hunters castDavid GuettaRihannaBruno MarsLinkin ParkSurprise package: Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding 2015 cover of Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence was just outside the top 10 most played songs on YouTube (in 11th).GlasgowGetty Images for ABA/Getty Images for SpotifyUS star Zach Bryan and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris proved popular in GlasgowTaylor Swift reigns on Spotify (again), while Glasgow gives Tate McRae her highest placing.It's also the only city where Scotland's superstar DJ Calvin Harris makes it into both the YouTube (11th) and Spotify (18th) lists.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterOasisKanye WestKendrick LamarZach BryanTate McRaeThe WeekndRihannaYouTube:EminemTaylor SwiftKPop Demon Hunters castLady GagaOasisEd SheeranBruno MarsRihannaSabrina CarpenterDavid GuettaSurprise package: Scotland, it seems, is keen on country music - Glasgow is the only place with US superstar Zach Bryan in its Spotify top 10. Edinburgh is the only other UK city with him in its top 20, in 14th place.LeedsGetty Images for Live Nation/RedfernsBillie Eilish and D-Block Europe are among the most popular stars in Leeds, as elsewhereIn the absence of their own home town heroes (sorry Kaiser Chiefs), Leeds listeners are big on other northern acts - it's the only place outside Newcastle to have Sam Fender and the only place outside Sheffield to have the Arctic Monkeys in the Spotify top 10 (Oasis are also not far behind in 14th).Over on YouTube, D-Block Europe are big in Leeds - second to Eminem overall - their joint highest placing, alongside Birmingham.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestRihannaKendrick LamarArctic MonkeysSam FenderYouTube:EminemD-Block EuropeEd SheeranKPop Demon Hunters castTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsDrakeThe WeekndSurprise packages: Chrystal's infectious The Days was a big hit, but nowhere bigger than in Leeds, where it was the third most played song of the year on YouTube with a million plays - closely followed by her collaboration with MK, Dior, at number four.LiverpoolWireImage via Getty ImagesSkye Newman performed at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Liverpool in MayLiverpool fans can't get enough of female pop stars, judging by these lists. Taylor Swift is top on Spotify, while Billie Eilish gets her joint highest position in fourth, and Ariana Grande gets her highest at number nine.Just outside the top 10, it's also Lady Gaga's joint highest Spotify placing (at 11) and Lana Del Rey's best position of any UK city (at 12).Meanwhile, rising British star Skye Newman was particularly popular on YouTube in Liverpool. She had two songs in the platform's top tracks of 2025 - Family Matters at eight and Hairdresser at 20.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishThe WeekndKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaAriana GrandeTate McRaeYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsTaylor SwiftLady GagaEd SheeranMazza L20RihannaCalvin HarrisThe WeekndSurprise package: Liverpool rapper Mazza L20 has crashed the YouTube top 10 in his home city above some global superstars. Real name Malcolm Graham, he was jailed in 2016 for possessing a handgun, before gaining attention online with viral hits like Murdaside.LondonWireImage/Parkwood via Getty ImagesJustin Bieber and Beyoncé only rated on the captial's listTaylor Swift was the most-played artist on Spotify in the UK overall, but Drake beat her to number one in the capital, while Olivia Dean and SZA were also more popular than the national average.Meanwhile, London was the only city to put Justin Bieber and Beyoncé in the Spotify top 20 (19th and 20th respectively).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterKendrick LamarKanye WestBillie EilishOlivia DeanSZAAriana GrandeYouTube:EminemArijit SinghEd SheeranDrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndD-Block EuropeBruno MarsLady GagaChris BrownSurprise package: Arijit Singh, one of India's biggest playback singers, was the second most popular musician of the year on YouTube in London. Singh, who released a duet with Ed Sheeran last year, racked up more than 40 million views in the capital, where he headlined a show at Tottenham Hotspur stadium in September.ManchesterHans Lucas via AFPThe Oasis reunion tour included five sold-out shows in Heaton Park, ManchesterBehind the big North American beasts (led by Drake and Taylor Swift, again), Manchester's (arguably) favourite musical sons Oasis were on repeat in their home city, being the fifth most played act overall on Spotify.That's their highest placing except for the Scottish cities - but the Gallagher brothers were absent from the lists in the south of England (London, Bristol and Southampton).Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndOasisKanye WestBillie EilishKendrick LamarRihannaEminemYouTube:EminemEd SheeranD-Block EuropeDrakeTaylor SwiftRihannaLady GagaBruno MarsThe WeekndArijit SinghSurprise package: The surprise is that Manchester seemingly went less KPop Demon Hunters crazy than elsewhere - the cast are absent from the top 10 YouTube artists (at 12th), and smash hit Golden only makes eighth, its lowest placing in any of the YouTube top songs charts.NewcastlePA MediaSam Fender has performed four stadium shows at the home of Newcastle United FC - two in 2023 and another two in 2025Tyneside's local hero Sam Fender isn't just big in the north-east, he's absolutely massive. The \"Geordie Springsteen\" played two huge hometown shows at St James' Park last summer and was the second most played artist on Spotify, behind the unmovable Taylor Swift. Beside Swift, he's the only person to have beaten Drake anywhere.What's more, Fender has four songs in Newcastle's top 20 Spotify tracks of the year - People Watching (number two), Seventeen Going Under (11), Arm's Length (15) and Hypersonic Missiles (16). None of his songs made the top 20 anywhere else.Spotify:Taylor SwiftSam FenderDrakeSabrina CarpenterThe WeekndKanye WestBillie EilishRihannaKendrick LamarOlivia DeanYouTube:EminemEd SheeranLady GagaTaylor SwiftRihannaKPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsDavid GuettaLinkin ParkD-Block EuropeSurprise package: Scottish dance producer Blair Muir's track Rehab hasn't troubled the main UK charts, but was the 10th most played song of the year on YouTube in Newcastle.NottinghamGetty Images/NetflixBruno Mars and Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys was popular on YouTube, while  SZA made the Spotify listNottingham loves KPop Demon Hunters - the film's cast kept Eminem off the YouTube number one spot. The rap legend is a lowly third, behind Bruno Mars.Meanwhile on Spotify, fans in Nottingham were the only listeners outside London, Birmingham and Manchester to have played Drake more than Taylor Swift, and gave SZA her highest placing beyond London.Spotify:DrakeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSabrina CarpenterBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaSZATate McRaeYouTube:KPop Demon Hunters castBruno MarsEminemEd SheeranLady GagaRihannaDrakeD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftThe WeekndSurprise package: This is the only city to have preferred Soda Pop by Kpop Demon Hunters' Saja Boys to Golden by their rivals Huntr/x, judging by their YouTube play counts. Soda Pop was second on Nottingham's list of most-played songs, with Golden fourth.SheffieldMyles Wright/ZUMA Press Wire via AlamyThe Arctic Monkeys last performed in Sheffield on June 9 and 10, 2023, with two headline homecoming gigs at Hillsborough ParkArctic Monkeys are another act to get a big hometown boost, coming fourth on the most-played list on Spotify, despite not having released an album or played live for a couple of years.Spotify:Taylor SwiftDrakeSabrina CarpenterArctic MonkeysThe WeekndBillie EilishKanye WestKendrick LamarRihannaOasisYouTube:EminemKPop Demon Hunters castEd SheeranBruno MarsLady GagaD-Block EuropeTaylor SwiftRihannaThe WeekndDenon ReedSurprise package: Birmingham producer and DJ Denon Reed, who is \"leading the revival of bassline\", is in the top 10 most played acts on YouTube in Sheffield - the only city where he features.SouthamptonWireImage via Getty imagesSouthampton is the only city with Coldplay in its Spotify top 10, and also the only place with Bruno Mars in the service's top 20 (at 19).Billie Eilish gets her joint highest Spotify ranking in Southampton, along with Liverpool.

    "body": "18 hours agoJessica RawnsleyWatch: Giant tortoises return to Galápagos island after nearly 200 yearsGiant tortoises are roaming the Galápagos island of Floreana for the first time in more than 180 years, in what conservationists have called a \"hugely significant milestone\".The release of 158 captive-bred juvenile tortoises onto the island is part of the Floreana Ecological Restoration Project led by the Galápagos National Park Directorate.The reintroduction follows a \"back-breeding\" programme launched in 2017 after scientists discovered tortoises carrying ancestry of the Floreana giant tortoise on nearby Isabela island.Floreana's native species, Chelonoidis niger niger, was driven to extinction in the 1840s by sailors who took thousands from the island for sustenance during long voyages. \"The restoration of Floreana has reached a hugely significant milestone, with 158 captive-bred giant tortoises released into the wild this week,\" the Galápagos Conservation Trust (GCT) said in a statement on Friday.\"This long-anticipated moment gives hope, not just for the future of Floreana, but for the future restoration of islands around the world,\" it added.Dr Jen Jones, GCT chief executive, described the moment as \"truly spine-tingling,\"  adding that it had validated two decades of collaboration between scientists, charities and the local community.The conservation project became possible after scientists discovered tortoises carrying Floreana ancestry on Wolf Volcano on Isabela island in 2008. Researchers selected 23 hybrid tortoises with the closest genetic links to the extinct subspecies and began breeding them in captivity on Santa Cruz island.By 2025, more than 600 hatchlings had been produced, with several hundred now large enough to survive in the wild.The GCT described the giant tortoises as \"ecosystem engineers\" and said they played an \"outsized role in restoring degraded ecosystems\" because of the way their activity shapes landscapes.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaThe government will not be withdrawing \"effective support\" from children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) under its planned school reforms for England, the education secretary has said.Bridget Phillipson told the BBC the government would be \"spending more money\", not less, on supporting children with SEND as part of its efforts to overhaul the system.But the cabinet minister said children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs\", following leaks which suggested pupils will be assessed as they move into secondary school.The full details of the government's proposed changes to SEND provision in England will be outlined in a White Paper, which will be published on Monday.The policy paper has been highly anticipated by parents who fear the reforms could mean the support their child receives could be limited in some way.The proposals in the paper come as the government faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.Leaks from the paper, reported by the BBC, suggest children with education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - which are legal documents outlining their extra support entitlement - will be reassessed after primary school from 2029.The BBC understands this will sit alongside an extension of legal rights to include all children with SEND through school-led Individual Support Plans (ISP).Every child with identified special educational needs, including those who do not currently have an EHCP, will have an ISP drawn up by the school, which will have some kind of legal status.Phillipson told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that \"EHCPs will have an important role to play in the new system\".\"The assurance I can give to parents is that under the new system, more children will receive support,\" Phillipson said.\"But they'll receive it more quickly. They'll receive it when they need it and where they need it. Parents won't have to fight so hard to get support through an EHCP.\"She said the new ISPs would have a legal \"underpinning\", meaning \"there are clear routes and clear principles set out in statute that will guide all of this\".When pressed on whether any child who currently receives support would lose it under the proposals, Phillipson said: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support from children.\"She added: \"And what I'll be setting out tomorrow is a decade-long, very careful transition from the system that we have - which everyone recognises isn't working.\"But she acknowledged that children \"will be reviewed in terms of their needs assessed\".\"That should be happening at the moment,\" Phillipson said. \"We're meant to be having a system where every year an EHCP is reviewed. That doesn't always happen.\"In an interview on the same programme, shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the Conservatives \"do have some big concerns about what is being floated\".Trott said too many parents \"had to fight for the support and the idea that they're going to be reassessed will be genuinely frightening\".For Hannah Luxford, whose teenage son has anxiety, it took 18 months to get him an EHCP.\"It's an unhelpful, adversarial, complex system that is designed to make you give up,\" Luxford told the BBC.Now, Luxford says her son is thriving at a funded virtual school. But she worries about his legal rights under the new reforms. \"I want to hear that for those of us already with EHCPs that we are protected,\" she said noting how her son's is getting the \"education he deserves\" at the school he currently attends.\"If that's taken away, it will take us back to where we were five years ago.\"There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among Labour MPs, whose backing will be required if these plans make it to Parliament.The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.In recent analysis, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.Luke Sibieta, from the IFS, said the situation is \"worst of all worlds\" with rising numbers of EHCPs and increasing costs but no better quality for children.\"Unfortunately we still have a system that is characterised by conflict, by fight, but also by really patchy levels of quality.\"Under its proposed reforms, the government is also planning to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.It will attempt to do this by reforming how schools target funding for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The latest GCSE results show the disadvantage gap index for year 11s stood at 3.92, according to the Department for Education (DfE).It had previously dropped to a low of 3.66 in 2019/20 with some small fluctuations in between, but it began widening in the post-pandemic years. In the 2022/2023, it reached the highest it had been in a decade at 3.94.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoOttilie MitchellandYama Bariz,BBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIslamabad said the strikes were launched on Afghanistan following recent suicide bombings in PakistanPakistan has carried out multiple overnight air strikes on Afghanistan, which the Taliban has said killed at least 18 people, including women and children.Islamabad said the attacks targeted seven alleged militant camps and hideouts near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and that they had been launched after recent suicide bombings in Pakistan.Afghanistan condemned the attacks, saying they targeted multiple civilian homes and a religious school. The fresh strikes come after the two countries agreed to a fragile ceasefire in October following deadly cross-border clashes, though subsequent fighting has taken place.The Taliban's defence ministry said the strikes targeted civilian areas of Nangarhar and Paktika provinces and had killed dozens of people.In Girdi Kas village, in the Bihsud district of Nangarhar, a man named Shahabuddin told reporters while pointing at his destroyed house that of 23 members of his family, only five had survived the attack. Local Taliban spokesman Sayed Taib Hamd said that 18 members of the family had been killed.The BBC had earlier been told about 20 people were thought to have died. No deaths have been reported so far in the other areas hit. A guesthouse and a religious school were targeted in the Bermal and Urgun districts of Pakitka province, but they were empty at the time of the attacks, local officials and locals told the BBC.AFP via Getty ImagesHouses were also destroyed in Balish village in the Urgun district of Pakitka province (pictured)Pakistan's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said it had carried out \"intelligence based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts\".In a statement on X, it said the targets included members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which the government refers to as \"Fitna al Khawarij,\" along with their affiliates and the Islamic State-Khorasan Province.The ministry described the strikes as \"a retributive response\" to recent suicide bombings in Pakistan by terror groups it said were sheltered by Kabul.The recent attacks in Pakistan included one on a Shia mosque in the capital Islamabad earlier this month, as well as others that took place since the holy month of Ramadan began this week in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Pakistan accused the Afghan Taliban of failing to take action against the militants, adding that it had \"conclusive evidence\" that the attacks were carried out by militants on the instructions of their leadership in Afghanistan.The Taliban's defence ministry later posted on X condemning the attacks as a \"blatant violation of Afghanistan's territorial integrity\", adding that they were a \"clear breach of international law\".It warned that \"an appropriate and measured response will be taken at a suitable time\", adding that \"attacks on civilian targets and religious institutions indicate the failure of Pakistan's army in intelligence and security.\"The strikes come days after Saudi Arabia mediated the release of three Pakistani soldiers earlier this week, who were captured in Kabul during border clashes last October.Pakistan and Afghanistan share a 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border.",

    "body": "2 days agoMelvin BoatengLondonThe fox was named Meatball because of the food given to help her recoverA Hackney resident whose story of her nursing a fox back to health went viral on social media says she has formed a \"special connection\" with the animal.In September 2025, Blakeley Bermingham and Josh Smith shared Meatball's story to TikTok and Instagram, where it garnered almost seven million views.Bermingham, 43, first spotted an injured fox in her garden in October 2024 shivering and bleeding, with bald patches on its tail and signs of mange.After speaking to her local vet, she contacted the Fox Angels Foundation, a charity that rescues and treats injured foxes, and began leaving turkey mince meatballs mixed with medicine for the fox, later naming her Meatball.\"We couldn't just leave a creature in that state, It was awful,\" she said. Mange is a common issue for foxes, especially during winter, with many foxes dying or being left with serious injuries such as blindness.With the help of Fox Angels, Meatball gradually recovered and has since returned regularly to Bermingham's garden.Fox Angels FoundationThere are an estimated 10,000 urban foxes living in LondonDuring her recovery, Meatball became pregnant but due to her ill health, her cubs did not survive.Over the next year, Meatball became more comfortable and lively, often watching the TV through the glass, walking into Bermingham's house, and playing in her garden.\"Fox Angels were so quick to give advice and send medicine, I'm really grateful for them,\" she said.There are an estimated 10,000 urban foxes living in London, but up to 80% of cubs die before reaching adulthood, often due to road accidents.\"We've ruined their environments,\" said Bermingham.\"For better or worse, [foxes] are having to live with us, so it is our job to take care of them when we see them in trouble.Blakeley BerminghamFoxes are classed as wild animals, not pestsFox Angels Foundation has helped foxes around the UK since 2019 and rely solely on donations.Each month, the team of 26 volunteers treat about 400 foxes onsite, like Meatball, with a further 14 a month being sent to vets and rehabilitation centres to treat more serious cases.Under the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons Code of Professional Conduct, veterinary surgeons and nurses are obliged to provide emergency first aid and pain relief to any animal, but Fox Angels say many vets turn foxes away.Fox care is costly, with a recent case costing more than £2,000 to treat a fox with an injured eye and £5,000 to treat a fractured leg.Chair of Fox Angel Foundation, Lynne Driscoll, said: \"I wish people would realise foxes are living beings with family structures and feelings.\"She says many people try to kill and hunt foxes, and poison is being used frequently in urban areas such as London.Foxes are classed as wild animals, not pests, therefore councils do not have a responsibility to remove them from private or public property.",

    "body": "1 hour agoMaia DaviesReutersMike Huckabee, pictured in September, has long been a supporter of IsraelArab and Muslim governments have condemned remarks made by the US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, who suggested Israel would be justified in taking over a vast stretch of the Middle East on Biblical grounds.In an interview with conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson, Huckabee was asked whether Israel had a right to an area which the host said was, according to the Bible, \"essentially the entire Middle East\".The ambassador said \"it would be fine if it took it all\". But he added Israel was not seeking to do so, rather it is \"asking to at least take the land that they now occupy\" and protect its people.In a joint statement, more than a dozen governments including Jordan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates called the comments \"dangerous and inflammatory\", and a threat to efforts to end the war in Gaza.In the interview, released on Friday, Carlson pressed the ambassador on his interpretation of a Bible verse which the host claimed suggested Israel had a right to the land between the River Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.Huckabee said \"it would be a big piece of land\" but stressed that \"I don't think that's what we're talking about here today\".He later added: \"They're not asking to go back to take all of that, but they are asking to at least take the land that they now occupy, they now live in, they now own legitimately, and it is a safe haven for them.\"He also said his earlier remark that Israel could take it \"all\" had been somewhat \"hyperbolic\".Following the interview's release, the UAE's foreign ministry released the statement  on behalf of various governments and other actors expressing \"strong condemnation and profound concern\" regarding the comments.The statement said Huckabee had \"indicated that it would be acceptable for Israel to exercise control over territories belonging to Arab states, including the occupied West Bank\".It said the remarks violated international law and directly contradicted US President Donald Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, including efforts to create \"a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state\".The statement continued: \"The ministries reaffirmed that Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands.\"\"They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states.\"The statement said it was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.Huckabee has frequently expressed his support for Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank, contradicting decades of US policy.Israel has built about 160 settlements housing 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem - land Palestinians want, along with Gaza, for a hoped-for future state - during the 1967 Middle East war. An estimated 3.3 million Palestinians live alongside them.The settlements are illegal under international law - a position supported by an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in 2024.Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the court had made a \"decision of lies\" and insisted that \"the Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land\".Successive Israeli governments have allowed settlements to grow. However, expansion has risen sharply since Netanyahu returned to power in late 2022 at the head of a right-wing, pro-settler coalition, as well as the start of the Gaza war, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October 2023 attack on Israel.More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's subsequent military offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

    "body": "I didn't know I was experiencing burnout until it was too late12 hours agoGeorgia Levy-CollinsBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesLaviai Nielsen won two bronze medals at the 2024 Summer OlympicsYou've just won two Olympic medals, reached the peak of your career so far, you're the strongest you've ever been, right? Wrong.Laviai Nielsen says straight after the 2024 Paris Olympics she felt \"emotionally, psychologically and mentally\" burnt out.Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, the 29-year-old says that once she realised she had burnout it was too late.\"It would take all of my energy to even get out of bed and get to the track,\" she says.\"It felt very unnatural for me, to think: 'Hold on, I need to slow down'.\"Newsbeat has been hearing from young people who say they have experienced burnout for a range of reasons, including unmanageable workload and pressure - with some pushing back key milestones, like saving for a house, as a result.In Nielsen's case, the Team GB sprinter decided to slow down and ended up taking a three-month break.\"It goes against everything you think an athlete should be,\" she says.\"The conversations leading up to the decision were the hardest bit, but once I made that decision, it was so easy.\"Nielsen began representing her country in her teens and won her first senior World Championship medal in 2017.But by the time she'd reached the Paris Olympics, mid-twenties activities - like socialising - became \"exhausting\".Despite competing at a high level athletically, she's not alone in her experience and young people are struggling with burnout in the workplace.Nielsen took three months off to recover from burnout The charity describes burnout as \"a state of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion\". It can build up over a long period of time - meaning it can take a while to recognise.The charity found that while young people are often seen as championing improved attitudes towards mental health at work, many were found to be \"staying silent\" about their own stress.Mental Health UK's 2026 burnout report also highlighted other aspects of life.\"This group is facing pressures both inside and outside work, alongside an uncertain job market where AI is increasingly seen as a threat to some entry-level roles,\" says the charity's chief executive Brian Dow.\"For many, the social contract that rewarded previous generations for hard work is breaking down,\" he adds.Younger workers aged 18 to 24 were second most likely to report stress due to money worries (64%), behind 65% of those aged 25 to 34, who agreed.University students are also struggling, says cognitive behavioural therapist Hannah Paskin.\"We're now getting lots and lots of graduates that can't get into graduate-level type jobs,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"So they're working really hard at university and then basically entering into quite low-paid, not career-oriented jobs.\"HandoutMimi Abbas returned home to family after experiencing burnout at university Mimi Abbas started to experience burnout in her final year of university and struggled with life after graduation.\"You know that you only have a month left of your degree and nothing in you has the spark or motivation to just carry on,\" Abbas says.The 23-year-old then returned home and spent six months applying for jobs, which she describes as a \"really difficult period\".\"It was just never-ending,\" she tells Newsbeat.The Bristol graduate ended up landing a job in the events industry, which she said was \"great\" but \"tiring with long hours\".\"I was going into the office, working, coming home, falling asleep. I didn't really have the energy to see my friends or go to the gym,\" she recalls. \"Any hobbies or passions I had on the side were kind of just put on the side.\"Abbas ended up leaving her corporate role and withdrawing her house savings.She now works part-time jobs in London - and feels better for it.\"I'd rather be happy and not feel so drained all the time,\" she says.@drbeccasalmonDr Becca Salmon said she was relieved when she took a step back from her workplace Dr Becca Salmon began posting about her own burnout after she left her NHS job.\"I look back on videos and pictures of myself from when I was working as a doctor and I look so unwell,\" she tells Newsbeat.The 29-year-old's video about quitting her role as a doctor in January 2024 sparked a big reaction and following.\"I had so much anxiety posting it, but the support and the familiarity from other people towards that was crazy,\" says Salmon.She says it took her six months to a year to fully recover from burnout.\"I think that's what people quite like in my story,\" she adds.\"It's just nice to know that burnout doesn't have to be the end.\"HandoutSpencer Clark has felt burnout trying to pursue his dream role while also working full-timeSpencer Clark, 23, can also relate to feeling burnout when trying to pursue a dream role.He tells Newsbeat he has been building his social media presence as he wants to be an online fitness coach, but is also working a full-time job in the precious metal industry so he can pay the bills. \"I do 12-hour shifts at work and trying to muddle all of them together has just been really hard,\" Clark says.\"My nutrition's on point, I go to the gym, I'm a healthy guy, but I've just overworked myself clearly.\"He says he often sees self-proclaimed \"fitness gurus\" on social media who are encouraging others to reduce their sleep to fit more in, but he believes that's not the answer. While the Mental Health UK report shows a notable number of young people are being affected by burnout, clinical psychologist Dr Claire Plumbly says it is not a new issue - it's just \"being talked about a lot more\".She explains that because it's not an official mental health diagnosis, doctors previously weren't using the term, but there is now greater understanding of it. Plumbly, who has written a book on how to manage burnout, also notes it doesn't just affect the younger workforce. \"Millennials and Gen X, they'll have better-paid jobs, perhaps, but extra responsibilities,\" she adds.Nicki CameronHannah Paskin says stepping back and slowing down can help ease burnoutHowever, there are aspects of today's digital society which can particularly affect young people, therapist Paskin says.\"From quite a young age, their life has been on social media, through teenage years when we're very impressionable,\" she says.\"A lot of people's default when they can't switch off is to scroll.\"Scrolling in bed before they go to sleep, and first thing when they're getting up.\"Choice overload, particularly for chronically online young people, can also lead to burnout, she adds. Preventing burnout There are things you can do to help prevent burnout, Paskin says.\"It's that desire to step out of the commercial world, step out of all those sorts of bits of life, step back from phone use.\" She suggests that getting breathing space from stress can restore energy, which is something Nielsen is doing.She is back to training and says rest is her top priority.\"We are a society that pride ourselves on continuing to work hard and going higher and pushing higher,\" Nielsen says.\"Rest is not laziness. It's a necessity.\"The professional athlete says that she now has more balance as a result.\"Instead of being solely focused on athletics, I'm making sure that I'm nourishing some things away from the track,\" she adds.Salmon agrees, saying she now limits how much she books in.\"You're definitely not alone and it definitely does get better,\" she says.\"Be kind to yourself, take that rest.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on thisRelated links",

After returning home from holiday, everything was in its place in Amanda's home. But little did she know that her furniture had been on a holiday of their own after the comedian came to her house and handpicked items to send to Albert Square. Amanda, who has watched the soap since it first aired in 1985, said: \"My daughter was helping them with this because she was at home.\"Apparently everything was put back but they took a big clock off the wall and she couldn't get that back on to sit properly.\"Thankfully after enlisting other family members to put everything back, Amanda's daughter, Sophie Grey, got away with it and her mum didn't notice a thing.Gillian Taylforth, who plays Amanda's favourite character Kathy Beale, travelled to Swansea with McIntyre to surprise the soap super fanOn the day of the special episode, Amanda's family took her for a meal while secret cameras were set up across the house, with McIntyre and the team next door watching it unfold. As well as some real scenes from the show, the prank involved creating a new storyline where Kathy Beale was on the hunt for a dubious character called Amanda. \"I was just thinking 'hmm okay there's a few odd things at the minute'.\"I didn't know, obviously, that they were next door and they were filming me watching this fake episode of EastEnders.\"Some of the items on the programme that Amanda noticed included her dressing gown, a world flags book and even her sofa. But she failed to hear her husband Mark's voice on a phone call with Kathy, or see her son's walk-on cameo at the Queen Vic.\"They all should be on the stage because they're such good, good actors,\" she said. Amanda and her family travelled to London to take part in Michael McIntyre's Big ShowThe prank was revealed when McIntyre, who had his own cameo in the Eastenders episode, knocked on her door.\"I just could not believe it, it was absolutely brilliant,\" Amanda said.\"It was one of the best, best surprises ever.\"I'm so honoured to be part of it because they [Michael McIntyre's Big Show] don't do it very often.\"Amanda's daughter Sophie helped make sure her mum's furniture was returned to its original place after filmingAlong with McIntyre, Amanda got another shock when Gillian Taylforth, the actress behind iconic character Kathy, made the journey to Swansea.Amanda said: \"I just love her and she came and she was absolutely lovely. It was so nice for her to give up her time.\"She and her family then travelled to London to take part in the McIntyre's Big Show, where she said she was treated \"like a star\".After the prank was revealed, Amanda said:  \"I was like, 'did that actually just happen?'\"\"I think I was walking around in like a stunned, surprised trance if you like for about three weeks.\"Now a bigger fan than ever, Amanda jokes that the famous theme song makes her have a \"little panic attack\" at the thought of it happening again.More top stories",

    "body": "Are ties and blazers on the way out? Why some schools are pushing for 'active' uniforms12 hours agoGrace DeanBBCPupils at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active\"If I had a pound for every time I said 'tuck your shirt in', I wouldn't need to teach, I'd be a millionaire,\" laments one Derbyshire secondary school teacher.The teacher, who asked us not to use their real name, works at a school with a strict uniform policy, where pupils can end up in detention if they repeatedly forget their tie or paint their nails. Pupils wear a blazer, shirt and tie, which \"look really uncomfortable\".\"We're meant to stand at the door and greet students just to check that they're wearing the uniform correctly and that their shirts are tucked in and they're looking smart and ready to learn,\" the teacher says. \"It just wastes time.\"She says the regular uniform checks are disruptive for pupils and give teachers unnecessary work.Another secondary school in Derbyshire, Alvaston Moor Academy, is now ditching blazers and ties in favour of a black all-weather jacket and polo shirt from September.The teacher we spoke to called the policy \"genius\". \"It looks so comfortable and it looks smart still,\" she says.One teacher called Alvaston Moor Academy's new uniform \"genius\"Currently, learning to tie a tie for secondary school is almost a rite of passage in the UK. In fact, a 2020 study of the uniform policies of every state secondary school in Scotland found that 90% required ties and 66% had blazers.But Alvaston Moor's new uniform appears to be part of a broader movement to introduce more practical school clothing. Proponents say this encourages children to be more active, is more comfortable and makes life easier for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) - but others argue traditional uniforms look smarter and instil discipline.One concern some parents and staff have about traditional school clothing is that blazers, which some schools demand pupils wear at all times, aren't always weather appropriate.'It's a bigger issue than people realise'One Leeds grandmother says her 11-year-old granddaughter is often \"freezing\" at school wearing her blazer, as opposed to a jumper: \"That isn't conducive to children's learning.\"A former teacher in Walsall says the secondary school where she used to work had the opposite problem - pupils usually weren't allowed to take their blazers off, leaving them uncomfortable at times. Mum Laura has a similar issue with her son, who has ADHD and often gets hot and claustrophobic in his formal shirt and tie.Laura's son isn't alone. Traditional school uniforms can often be difficult for SEND pupils.\"It's actually a bigger issue than people realise,\" says Duncan, from Devon, whose teenage daughter is autistic and has sensory processing disorder, which means she is more sensitive to how clothing feels against her skin.His daughter switched schools two years ago, and one of the main reasons was her school's inflexible uniform policy, he says.The teenager found some aspects of her uniform so uncomfortable that they became painful, like the embroidered logo, seams and tag on her polo shirt, her dad says.\"She was refusing school for a long time,\" Duncan says. He says her previous SEND school turned down his proposal that she wear her own T-shirt in the school's colour and black leggings or jogging bottoms.Among primary schools, the push for more practical school uniforms is largely to encourage physical activity and play. More than half of children aged five to 16 weren't meeting the chief medical officer's guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity per day in the 2023-2024 school year, says Sport England.Link to behaviour \"If you were taking your kids out on a Saturday to play, there is no way that you would choose the kind of clothes that we send children to school in,\" says Prof Helen Dodd, who researches children's play at the University of Exeter. \"The clothes that they're wearing are getting in the way.\"A small-scale 2012 study by Australian academics suggested that girls at primary schools were \"significantly more active\" during breaks and at lunchtime when they wore their sports uniform rather than their winter uniform. A 2021 study was less conclusive but suggested that wearing sports uniforms \"may yield small improvements\" in activity levels throughout the day.Academics and parents also push back against some of the main arguments in favour of more traditional uniforms - for example, that they encourage better behaviour and prepare pupils for the world of work.\"The research evidence does not support that smart uniform affects behaviour,\" says Dodd from the University of Exeter.And fewer people are wearing blazers and ties to work after the pandemic led to people dressing more informally for the office. What people wear to the office has \"just gone so casual\" in the past few years, personal stylist Karina Taylor previously told BBC News, attributing this to the rise in remote work.But many people told BBC News they were still in favour of having some kind of uniform to create a sense of community and to stop pupils who couldn't afford the latest trends feeling left out.\"I think you can have a school uniform without it being cumbersome,\" says Duncan, who also has a son who wears a blazer and tie to middle school.'You don't have to wear a uniform to learn'Some schools have already ditched blazers and ties in favour of a more comfortable uniform.A survey of teachers in 2024 by the app Teacher Tapp suggested that fewer secondary school pupils were wearing ties than the previous year.The pandemic affected school uniform policies, as many pupils could wear what they wanted for virtual lessons, says Dr Rachel Shanks of the University of Aberdeen.\"People could see, especially teenagers, you don't have to be wearing a uniform to be learning,\" she says.And after lockdown, some primary schools began letting pupils come in in their sports kits on days they had PE, \"and a lot of schools have kept to that\" after realising pupils were more comfortable, she says.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to what it called an \"always active\" uniform in 2024 with support from Youth Sport Trust. Pupils now wear leggings or jogging bottoms, a t-shirt and a hoodie, with black trainers.Head teacher Iain Williamson tells BBC News it was \"one of the best changes\" the school had introduced, with attendance and behaviour improving afterwards.Dame Dorothy Primary School in Sunderland switched to an \"always active\" uniform in 2024He reels off the benefits: PE lessons are 20 minutes longer now since pupils don't need to get changed, they don't have to worry about bringing their sports kit, the uniform is quick drying and doesn't need ironing, and pupils are more active in the playground.Many staff members at the school even opt to wear the active uniforms, too, he says.Some schools say less formal uniforms particularly benefit girls.Girls at Broadbent Fold Primary School in Cheshire had wanted a change in uniform so they could be more active, head teacher Catherine Parker tells BBC News. Since introducing the new uniform, girls play more during break time, she says.Rachel's daughter is in year seven at a secondary school in Cheshire where pupils wear polo shirts with a choice of sweatshirt, jumper or fleece.\"It's really practical, it looks really smart,\" Rachel says.Duncan's daughter's new SEND school doesn't have a uniform.\"She's allowed to wear what she wants and she's comfortable in because there is an understanding there that it makes a big difference to her ability to engage,\" she says.",

    "body": "Iran students stage first large anti-government protests since deadly crackdown14 hours agoJaroslav LukivScuffles break out at Sharif University in TehranStudents at several universities in Iran have staged anti-government protests - the first such rallies on this scale since last month's deadly crackdown by the authorities.The BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. Scuffles were later seen breaking out between them and government supporters. A sit-in was held at another Tehran university, and a rally reported in the north-east. Students were honouring thousands of those killed in mass protests in January.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.US and Iranian officials met in Switzerland on Tuesday and said progress had been made in talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear programme.But despite the reported progress, Trump said afterwards that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached with Iran or the US would take military action. The US leader has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\". Footage verified by the BBC shows hundreds of protesters peacefully marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology at the start of a new semester on Saturday.The crowds chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei - and other anti-government slogans.A separate crowd of supporters of a rival pro-government rally - many with national Iranian flags - are seen nearby at the beginning of the video. Scuffles are later seen breaking out between the two camps.Verified photos have also emerged showing a peaceful sit-in protest at the capital's Shahid Beheshti University.The BBC have also verified footage from another Tehran university, Amir Kabir University of Technology, showing chanting against the government.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city in the north-east, local students reportedly chanted: \"Freedom, freedom\" and \"Students, shout, shout for your rights\".Sizeable demonstrations in other locations were also reported later in the day, with calls for further rallies on Sunday.It is not immediately clear whether any demonstrators have been arrested.Last month's protests began over economic grievances and soon spread to become the largest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 7,015 people during that wave, including 6,508 protesters, 226 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. The latest figures were updated on 15 February.Hrana also said it was investigating 11,744 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Saturday's protests come as the Iranian authorities are preparing for a possible war with the US.The exiled opposition is adamantly calling on President Trump to make good on his threats and strike, hoping for a quick downfall of the current hardline government. But other opposition groups are opposed to outside intervention.The opposing sides have been involved in disinformation campaigns of social media, trying to maximise their conflicting narratives of what Iranian people want.Additional reporting by BBC Persian's Ghoncheh Habibiazad, and BBC Verify's Richard Irvine-Brown and Shayan Sardarizadeh.Update 22 February: This article was updated to make clear that those shown on video holding Iranian national flags were part of a pro-government rally, which was separate to the nearby anti-government protest.",

    "body": "12 hours agoDivya AryaBBC World ServiceBBCNisha Vaishnav has quickly excelled at football, rising to play for the Rajasthan state team in 2024One hot summer evening when Nisha Vaishnav was 14, she and her 18-year-old sister Munna were at football practice when they noticed five adult strangers taking photos of them.Nisha soon found out why they were there - the group were from the same family and included a couple looking for a wife for their son.Nisha's mother, who was also present, was keen to encourage the possibility of marriage. They all went back to the Vaishnavs' home in the village of Padampura, in the state of Rajasthan, north-western India.\"My mother asked me to touch their feet as a mark of respect,\" says Nisha. \"I refused.\"'Village women would point at us'While it is illegal for a girl under 18 or a boy under 21 to be married in India, in practice child marriage is still common.Around 25% of women living in India were married before they were of legal age, according to the children's charity Unicef. In Rajasthan, the rates of child marriage are higher than the national average and girls rarely feel able to refuse proposals or defy the wishes of their parents. Nisha was introduced in 2022 to football by Munna, who discovered the sport a year earlier through Football for Freedom - part of a state-wide non-profit organisation aimed at helping girls better their lives through sport.Munna had championed the project in her village, leading the battles for permission to travel to tournaments and wear shorts on the pitch rather than long tunics and loose trousers – a huge step in a village where married women cover their faces in the presence of men in public.\"For the first two to three days, village women would point to us and say, 'Look at those girls exposing their legs',\" says Munna. \"We ignored them, decided we didn't care, and continued wearing shorts.\"Munna has helped lead the battle in her village to play football in shorts and travel to tournamentsNisha quickly excelled at the game, rising to play for the Rajasthan state football team at the National Football Championship in 2024.She also cut her hair short - an act of defiance in a village where girls are expected to grow it long.When the marriage proposal from the family watching her at football practice came, Nisha pushed back. She made it clear she was too young to get married and wanted to continue to pursue her dreams in football.  After about a month, the other family retracted their offer.Nisha and Munna also resisted a joint marriage proposal from another family in 2025, involving both of them and their younger brother.When their father asked Nisha if she had a lover waiting for her at football practice, she says she replied: \"There is no lover. I am going to play football - that is my love.\"Finding employment through footballGirls who marry as children are at increased risk of sexual coercion, early pregnancy, malnutrition and poorer health, according to many studies.They are also more likely to leave education early, reducing their chances to improve their life circumstances.Padma Joshi, from Football for Freedom, which is part of the Mahila Jan Adhikar Samiti women's rights non-profit organisation, wants to educate families about these risks.She says Football for Freedom has trained about 800 girls across 13 villages in Rajasthan since it was formed in 2016.\"When we started talking to parents we never said that we were introducing football to stop child marriage,\" says Joshi.Joshi explains to parents that excelling at football could ultimately help their girls get jobs, as Indian states set aside some public sector roles for sportsmen and women.Laali Vaishnav, who was a child bride herself, says she worries her girls will be exposed to \"bad influences\"Poverty, as well as tradition, is among the reasons families in India continue to marry off their girls, who are often regarded as financial burdens.Nisha and Munna have an older sister who was married in 2020 at the age of 16, and their mother, Laali, was a child bride herself.Defending her decisions, Laali says villagers fear that unless their children are married young they'll be \"exposed to bad influences and run away with boys\".Asked if she knew that marrying her eldest daughter at 16 was illegal, she nods, explaining that no-one gets caught: \"We do it quietly, we don't print a wedding invitation or decorate the house or put up a tent.\"But the law is clear - facilitating child marriage is a crime. Adults who carry out ceremonies, along with parents or guardians who permit child marriage or negligently fail to stop it, can be imprisoned for up to two years and fined 100,000 rupees ($1,100; £950).If a child marriage isn't reported, it can later be registered when the man and woman are of legal age and no-one will be prosecuted.The number of cases of child marriage being reported across India has gradually been rising as awareness and enforcement have improved. There were 1,050 cases reported in 2021 compared to 395 in 2017, according to the Ministry of Women and Child Development.However, this is a tiny proportion of the estimated 1.5 million girls under the age of 18 who are married each year in India, according to Unicef.​​Nisha and Munna's team came first at the under-17s State level School Games, held in October 2025Nisha, who is now 15 and still at school, hopes to one day play football for India's national team.If she doesn't make it, securing a government job would allow her to become financially independent and have freedom.To qualify for one of the jobs set aside for sportsmen and women, she needs to keep playing at state level or better until after she finishes university.While Munna, who is now 19, managed to escape child marriage, the possibility of an arranged marriage being pushed for by her older sister's in-laws remains.She is resisting the proposal.Munna has not reached the same heights in football as Nisha, but helps train girls at the Football for Freedom Project and is studying for a degree at university.She hopes to become a sports teacher at a school.In the meantime, she counsels the girls she trains against child marriage.\"Whether I am able to stop their marriage or not, I want to help them become something in life, realise their dreams.\"",

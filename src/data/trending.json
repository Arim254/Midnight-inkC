However, it does not provide a breakdown. </p></div><p></p><h2>'Public profile'</h2><p></p><div><p>Prof Tim Bale leads the Party Membership Project, a joint project between Queen Mary University of London and Sussex University.</p><p>He said the drop in membership was surprising given the Lib Dems' electoral success, which would suggest \"a party on the up, in which case you might get more ambitious people wanting to join it\".</p><p>But he added: \"There's an extent to which surges into parties are prompted by public profile... and they don't seem to have much chance of getting into government at the moment.\"</p><p>In more positive news for the Lib Dems, he said research carried out by his project after the 2024 election showed that the Liberal Democrats were the most active of all the memberships of the political parties.</p><p>Figures collected showed that a greater proportion of Lib Dem members (19%) had canvassed voters face-to-face or over the phone than any other party.</p><p>Prof Bale said there was \"all sorts of research over time that, certainly in very close races, contact with the voters, whether that be face to face or just leafletting does seem to make a difference\". </p><p>A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: \"We have a record number of MPs, the most popular party leader in the country, and elected more councillors than Labour or the Conservatives for the first time ever in May's local elections.</p><p>\"When it comes to actual elections, more and more people are backing the Liberal Democrats as the only party that can stop Reform turning Trump's America into Farage's Britain.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>Other parties</h2><p></p><div><p>Working out how many members a political party has can be tricky.</p><p>There is no legal obligation for political parties to publish their membership figures, so they tend to only be revealed in annual accounts or when a party holds a leadership election.</p><p>Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce83jgnx4w5o\">drop in membership</a> of 37% since 2020.</p><p>Latest published figures put its membership at 333,235 at the end of last year, although reports have suggested it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://labourlist.org/2025/02/labour-party-membership-drop-since-general-election/\">may have fallen further</a> to 309,000.</p><p>An updated figure should be given by Labour later this month, when the winner of its deputy leadership contest is announced. </p><p>Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has just under 260,000 members.</p><p>The Green Party of England and Wales has seen a rapid surge in membership and now says its has 90,000 members, which is a 54% rise on last year's figure of 58,322 in December.</p><p>The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures, but 131,680 people were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election, which is 40,000 fewer than in the 2022 contest.</p><p>Party membership figures are not verified by outside bodies. </p></div><p></p><h2>Where we got our figures</h2><p></p><div><p>The figure that has been most recently used for the current size of the Lib Dems is 83,174, which was the figure for December 2024 that appears in the party's annual accounts, including both members and registered supporters.</p><p>As the freelance journalist Adam Ramsay has pointed out, the figure for paid-up members is given elsewhere, in a statement for the party treasurer in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/Api/Accounts/Documents/27277\">accounts for the Liberal Democrats in England</a>.</p><p>It says there was an \"overall membership of 60K\", with 55,000 - or 92% of them - in England, and supporter levels that \"remain constant at over 20K\".</p><p>To get the membership figure for 2020, we looked to the number of ballot papers issued in the leadership election, as only full members can vote.</p><p>At the time, the party said it had issued 117,924, papers, which was its highest ever number. </p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6133/live/2bce6ee0-0b00-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png.webp\" alt=\"Thin, red banner promoting the Politics Essential newsletter with text saying, “Top political analysis in your inbox every day”.

This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

Before proceedings began one test case, retired Lt Col Andrew Davies, settled his claim for £182,250.</p><p>The MoD accepts it has a duty of care but disputes the extent to which hearing loss happened in some cases.</p></div><div><p>Mr Lambie, 45, is claiming more than £400,000 in damages, but the MoD has offered him about £58,000 with its barristers claiming his hearing loss has not and will not have an impact on his future income.</p><p>He joined the Royal Marines in 1998 and was diagnosed with NIHL in 2002 but, in a witness statement, said \"nothing was put in place to prevent me from being exposed to loud noise\".</p><p>Members of his unit were put through a hearing test before deployment to Afghanistan in 2011 and Mr Lambie said he was \"very conscious\" about as his \"entire career was spent training for deployment\".</p><p>He initially failed but said he passed a retake by watching the medic testing him \"press the button for the tone and then I pressed my clicker straight away\".</p><p>He said the medic conducting his tests was \"completely aware\" of this.</p><p>\"We all knew that the emphasis on the staff was to ensure that Marines passed all the tests they needed to pass for deployment, as the MoD needed as many people as possible to deploy,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is why the medics helped us pass our medicals.\"</p><p>Mr Lambie, who is now a defence and security consultant after being discharged in 2021, said members of the unit had joked about cheating the tests to ensure they passed regardless of whether they needed to.</p><p>The MoD has accepted \"primary causation\" in his case, but disputes how much he should receive.</p><p>David Platt KC, for the department, said in written submissions that Mr Lambie's \"instance of faking\" the hearing test in 2011 was an \"undoubtedly regrettable\" but “apparently isolated instance of cheating\".</p><p>He said the amount the former marine was claiming was \"wholly unrealistic\" as hearing loss had not impeded his career.</p></div><div><p>At a hearing in July last year, the MoD admitted that it had a duty of care to former personnel, having disputed this in earlier legal action.</p><p>It also accepted that noise exposure during service caused hearing loss among former personnel, but disputes the extent to which this happened in some individual cases.</p><p>Lt Col Davies, 58, said his pay out \"does finally acknowledge what I lost and provides some justice\". In a statement he said that serving was an \"honour and a privilege\" but being left with a permanent injury which could have been prevented was \"hard to accept\".</p><p>Another former serviceman, Stephen Hambridge, settled his case for £550,000.</p></div><div><p>An MoD spokesperson said: \"To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, we are defending against a range of claims or limiting costs.</p><p>\"Many of these claims are historic, and in the years since, we have substantially improved protective measures around hearing to prevent noise-related issues amongst our people.</p><p>\"The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme provides no-fault compensation to Service Personnel and veterans for injuries, illness and death caused by service.\"</p><p>The trial is due to last nine weeks.</p><p>Separately thousands of military veterans are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce84e4egp38o\">taking legal action</a> against the MoD and an earplug manufacturer after being given ear protection they say was faulty.</p></div>",

The Keystone XL discussions were first reported by CBC News.</p><p>The conversation was described as preliminary, sources told the BBC, and both Carney and Trump have instructed their teams to continue discussions in the coming days.</p><p>In a statement on Wednesday, the prime minister said his meeting with Trump focused on \"key priorities in trade and defence\", and that the two leaders \"identified opportunities for material progress in trade in steel, aluminium and energy\".</p><p>Carney's statement did not mention any specific energy projects, including any oil pipelines.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-30103078\">Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed?</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55816229\">Why I fought for - or against - the Keystone XL pipeline</a></li></ul><p>The prime minister is under domestic pressure to secure a trade and security deal with the US in the face of steep tariffs on key Canadian sectors, including a 50% levy on steel and aluminium and a 25% levy on vehicles. </p><p>Keystone XL was a planned 1,179-mile (1,897 kilometre) pipeline that was to run from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would join an existing pipe. It was estimated that it would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day.</p><p>It faced resistance from former President Barack Obama, who refused to issue the presidential permit required for its development in the US after the Enviromental Protection Agency (EPA) advised him not to approve it.</p><p>Environmentalists and indigenous groups have also long opposed the project.</p><p>Trump later revived the pipeline plans during his first term and construction began, but the project was halted after former President Joe Biden cancelled its permits on his first day in office.</p><p>The pipeline project was owned by Calgary-based TC Energy, which last year spun off its oil pipeline business into a new company named South Bow.</p><p>The company had abandoned the project after the permits were cancelled. It is estimated that billions of dollars were lost on the project, including a C$1.5bn ($1bn; £800m)  investment by the Alberta government. </p><p>After Trump raised the potential of its revival in February, South Bow said it had \"moved on\" from Keystone XL.</p><p>Sources familiar with the matter who spoke to the BBC declined to say whether there is industry interest in reviving the project. </p><p>In a statement, South Bow said it is not privy to the ongoing discussions between the Canadian and US governments, and added it is \"supportive of efforts to find solutions that increase the transportation of Canadian crude oil.\"</p><p>\"We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our existing corridor with our customers and others in the industry,\" a South Bow spokesperson said.</p><p>News of the pipeline being raised in discussions was welcomed by Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who told reporters at a Wednesday US-Canada summit in Toronto that she was pleased conversations are encompassing steel, aluminium and energy. </p><p>\"That has been our position for a long time,\" Smith said. \"One of the first things I told the prime minister is that we shouldn't be threatening to sell the Americans less. We should be promising to sell them more.\" </p><p>She added that she sees Alberta oil as a key player in \"a broader and complete renegotiation\" of the North American free trade agreement, USMCA, \"that benefits everyone\".</p><p>Separately, Smith's government has said it will pitch a pipeline project that would run through neighbouring British Columbia with hopes of finding a private company to back it. </p><p>That idea has been met with resistance by British Columbia Premier David Eby, who called it \"fictional\" and said it would threaten his province's ecosystem. </p><p>Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet has also criticised Alberta's oil plans, saying that he would denounce any new pipeline from the province for \"destroying the environment of the whole planet\". </p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

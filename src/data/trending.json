    "body": "The Metropolitan Police has said it will \"take no further action\" over claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked his police protection officer for information on accuser Virginia Giuffre.The allegations, first reported in the Mail on Sunday in October, said the then-prince gave the officer Ms Giuffre's date of birth and social security number, just before the paper published a photo of the pair meeting in February 2011.On Saturday, the Met said a further assessment \"has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct\".Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has not commented on the reports, but has consistently denied all allegations against him.A spokesperson for the police force said: \"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter.\"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action.\"As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.\"Ms Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision to drop the investigation \"without explanation and without speaking to us\".They added: \"With the Epstein files about to be released by Congress since the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan Police didn't wait to see what further evidence might appear.\"While we have hailed the UK's overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.\"Ms Giuffre said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.She claimed she was forced to have sex with the then-Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend - he died in a New York police cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In her memoir, published posthumously, Ms Giuffre described her allegations against the former prince in detail.She alleged the third time she had sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was on Epstein's island, as part of what she called \"an orgy\".She also recalled seeing a picture of Epstein and the former prince together in New York in 2011, saying she was \"revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll\" but \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"He reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, formally ending a civil sex assault case against him in the US.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein. He has always denied allegations of wrongdoing related to Epstein.Earlier this year he was stripped of his title as prince following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the convicted sex offender. He had previously given up his other royal titles - including the Duke of York.He is also due to leave his mansion in Windsor, the Royal Lodge, by next October. It's expected he will move to Sandringham, in Norfolk, early next year.On Friday, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was one of a number of high-profile figures to feature in photographs released by Democrats, showcasing Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.Epstein was associated with many well-known figures, and merely being named in files related to the disgraced financier is not an indication of wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.A cropped section of a picture showing the former prince talking to Microsoft founder Bill Gates was included in the latest batch of photographs.It was a cropped version of an image taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, with the original version showing them in conversation with King Charles.",

She left her Radio 2 breakfast show last December after almost six years in the role, before returning to present the 13:00 to 15:00 GMT Saturday programme.Speaking on the show on Saturday, Ball, 55, said: \"I have loved being betwixt my dear friends Romesh (Ranganathan) and Rylan (Clark), and you know, I love you all to bits, but I'm not disappearing completely.\"Obviously, it'll be Christmas Crooners and I'm doing an eras show in the new year, more on that later.\"Ball said she was \"thrilled\" to announce that Willis would take over the Saturday afternoon slot, \"a superwoman who is no stranger to you all\".She added that the new host - known for shows including The Voice, Big Brother and Love Is Blind - \"will officially become a member of the Radio 2 family\".In a statement, Willis, 49, said: \"I'm absolutely chuffed to be joining the family - and it's a real honour to follow in the huge footsteps Zoe leaves behind, who's someone I admire and adore.\"She said that she would miss listening to Ball but will \"happily be the filling to a Romesh and Rylan sandwich\".Willis hosted a show on Heart Radio from 2012 to 2018 and has presented on Radio 2 as a cover presenter since 2019.",

    "body": "5 hours agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A spokesperson for Messi said that he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media. A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentandAlex SmithSpecialist rape and sexual offence investigation teams will be introduced to every police force in England and Wales by 2029, the government has pledged.It is part of a long-delayed plan aimed at halving violence against women and girls within a decade.The strategy - which will include funding for undercover units operating online, and a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders - is due to be unveiled on Thursday, after being pushed back three times this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the measures will help to \"bear down on abusers, stopping them in their tracks. Rapists, sex offenders and abusers will have nowhere to hide.\"The government says the new teams will have officers with specialist investigation skills for working on rape and sexual offence cases.More than 50% of police forces already have these teams in place, but the government says every force will have dedicated officers by 2029.It says staff will have the right training to understand the mindset of abusers and victims.Announcing the move, the home secretary said: \"This government has declared violence against women and girls a national emergency.\"For too long, these crimes have been considered a fact of life. That's not good enough. We will halve it in a decade.\"Also announced is a roll out of domestic abuse protection orders, which have been trialled over the last year, across England and Wales.They can ban individuals from contacting a victim, visiting their home or posting harmful content online, and can also be used in cases involving coercive or controlling behaviour. Breaching an order is a criminal offence.There will also be almost £2m in investment for special undercover units of police officers operating online - to target those harassing women and girls on the internet.A report released earlier this month found that more than a quarter of police forces in England and Wales had not implemented basic policies for investigating sexual offences.It said sexually-motivated crimes against women in public remained widespread, criticised the limited nature of data on them, and called for urgent action to prevent predators from offending.The publishing of the government's strategy has been long delayed. It was initially expected to be announced in the spring.In Labour's general election manifesto last year the party pledged to use \"every government tool available to target perpetrators and address the root causes of abuse and violence\".On Tuesday, the chairs of three Commons select committees raised their concerns over repeated delays in publishing the plans.The BBC has previously been told that changing attitudes among boys and young men will be at the centre of what is proposed.It is understood it will be built around three goals: preventing radicalisation of young men, stopping abusers, and supporting victims.Some domestic abuse survivors have told the BBC the time for talking is over - and these measures must be implemented quickly.",

    "body": "How monogamous are humans? Scientists compile 'league table' of pairing up4 days agoHelen BriggsEnvironment correspondentGettyMeerkats are incredibly social animals and live in large groups known as 'mobs' or 'clans'Humans are a bit like meerkats when it comes to pairing up, according to a study that examined the monogamous lifestyles of different species.In our romantic life, we more closely resemble these social, close-knit mongooses than we do our primate cousins, a \"league table\" of monogamy compiled by scientists suggests.At 66% monogamous, humans score surprisingly highly, far above chimps and gorillas – and on a par with meerkats.However, we are by no means the most monogamous creature. Top spot goes to the Californian mouse - rodents that form inseparable, lifelong bonds.GettyChimpanzees are highly social and form strong bonds but have very different social structures from humans\"There is a premier league of monogamy, in which humans sit comfortably, while the vast majority of other mammals take a far more promiscuous approach to mating,\" said Dr Mark Dyble at the University of Cambridge.In the animal world, pairing up has its perks, which may be why it has evolved independently in multiple species, including us. Experts have proposed various benefits to so-called social monogamy, where mates match up for at least a breeding season to care for their young and see off rivals. Dr Dyble examined several human populations throughout history, calculating the proportions of full siblings – where individuals share the same mother and father – compared with half-siblings, individuals who share either a mother or a father, but not both. Similar data was compiled for more than 30 social monogamous and other mammals.Humans have a monogamy rating of 66% full siblings, ahead of meerkats (60%) but behind beavers (73%).Meanwhile, our evolutionary cousins fall at the bottom of the table - with mountain gorillas at 6% rating, while chimpanzees come in at just 4% (alongside the dolphin).In last place is Scotland's Soay sheep, where females mate with multiple males, with 0.6% full siblings. The Californian mouse came top, at 100%.However, being ranked alongside meerkats and beavers doesn't mean our societies are the same - human society is poles apart.\"Although the rates of full siblings we see in humans are most similar to species like meerkats or beavers, the social system that we see in humans is very different,\" Dr Dyble told BBC News.\"Most of these species live in colony-like social groups or perhaps live in solitary pairs that go around together. Humans are very different from that. We live in what we call multi-male, multi-female groups, within which we have these monogamous, or pair-bonded, units.\"GettySoay sheep are the most promiscuous of all the animals studiedDr Kit Opie at the University of Bristol, who is not connected with the study, said this is another piece in the puzzle over how human monogamy arose.\"I think this paper gives us a very clear understanding that across time and across space humans are monogamous,\" he said.\"Our society is much closer to chimps and bonobos – it just happens that we've taken a different route when it comes to mating.\"The new study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society: Biological Sciences.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSarah Rainsford,VilniusandDearbail JordanWatch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisonersBelarus has freed 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, after the US agreed to lift sanctions on the country.Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is also among those who have been released following talks in Minsk with US President Donald Trump's special envoy for Belarus, John Coale.The US has agreed to lift sanctions on potash, a key ingredient in fertiliser and an important export for Belarus, which is a close ally of Russia. Coale said: \"As relations between the two countries normalise, more and more sanctions will be lifted.\"Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, is not recognised as president by the EU. Kolesnikova has been in prison since 2020, much of the time in isolation. Speaking after her release, she described \"a feeling of unbelievable happiness\" at being able to see and hug people \"dear to me\". She said: \"It's a huge happiness to see the first sunset of my freedom, such amazing beauty.\"But also we think of those who are not yet free. I wait for the moment when we can all hug each other, when all are free.\"Kolesnikova was handed over to Ukraine along with 113 other prisoners, according to Kyiv's Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War.In a statement on Telegram, Ukraine said that after receiving the necessary medical assistance, the prisoners will be transported to Poland and Lithuania.ReutersNobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski arrives in VilniusSvetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled Belarusian opposition leader who was waiting outside the US embassy in Vilnius, told the BBC the decision to send them to Ukraine was unexpected and had been made by Lukashenko.A small number, including Bialiatski, were transported to the Lithuanian capital.After embracing Tikhanovskaya, Bialiatski said: \"Thousands of people have been and continue to be imprisoned...so our struggle continues.\"Khomich said the first thing Kolesnikova said when they spoke was \"thank you to the US administration, President Trump [and] to the Belarus government as well for leading and talking and having these negotiations\".The deal is a major achievement for Lukashenko. The authoritarian leader will also welcome how the Americans have ended his international isolation.As well as the EU, the US did not recognise Lukashenko as president following unfair elections five years ago which led to mass street protests that were brutally suppressed by police.Hundreds of people were arrested then - including Kolesnikova - and the intense political repression has continued.Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of WarMaria Kolesnikova and 113 other prisoners were transported to Ukraine from BelarusWestern sanctions were tightened following Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when troops entered via Belarus and missiles were launched from its territory.Coale was quoted by Belarusian state media saying that the sanctions on potash would be lifted immediately.The US envoy also said he spoke to Lukashenko about Ukraine and what help Minsk could offer in talks with Putin.The attempt to engage with Minsk is part of a major shift in US policy, which leaves it very much at odds with Europe where the approach is to sanction and isolate.Viktor Babaryko, a Belarusian opposition politician who was arrested five years ago, was also released on Saturday along with Marina Zolotova, editor-in-chief of  independent news site Tut.by. Commenting on the US deal with Belarus over potash shipments in exchange for the releases, Tikhanovskaya said sanctions are \"leverage to make dictators do something\".She said: \"Lukashenko will not release people because he somehow became humane, he wants to sell people as expensive as possible.\"Of course, it is the price. But we understand that American sanctions are rather flexible.\"They can lift them tomorrow if some deals are not fulfilled.\"",

    "body": "Why Jane Austen's characters are still so relatable12 hours agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonIf you're a Jane Austen fan, then Lizzy, Jane, Kitty and Lydia are likely to be the Bennet sisters you remember from Pride and Prejudice. But in a new follow-on to the story, it's their anxious and awkward sister Mary who takes centre stage.\"I came to [Jane] Austen as a kid from Croydon, in my teens, thinking that she couldn't possibly have anything to say to me,\" says Sarah Quintrell, screenwriter for the upcoming BBC drama The Other Bennet Sister.However, after reading the author's works, she couldn't believe how connected she felt to Austen's characters. It was as though she \"knew everybody\" in the 19th century novels, she says.The new TV series, based on the novel of the same name by Janice Hadlow, centres on the Bennet family's middle sister, Mary, as she becomes a governess to the Gardiner family.BBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonCostume designer Sian Jenkins curated each of the sisters' costumes around a specific flower. Jane's are based on a rose, Lizzy a cornflower, Kitty an iris and Lydia a \"wild\" primrose to accentuate their personality traits.It continues on from Austen's Pride and Prejudice - a story that centres on the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, in which Mary's most memorable scene is her awkwardly playing piano at a ball.Actress Ella Bruccoleri, who plays the teenage Mary, says she was drawn to the character because she's an \"atypical period drama heroine\" who is anxious, awkward and possesses none of the poise other Regency period protagonists hold.Quintrell adds: \"She's the odd one out. It's really hard for her to find her place in the world. And I think that that will really resonate with a modern audience.\"The screenwriter encourages young people to engage with Austen's fictional worlds, as she has. \"You will find so much that's recognisable.\"On Tuesday, it is Austen's 250th birthday. With Pride and Prejudice published in 1813, why do the cast and crew of this new drama think her work continues to speak to people?Coming of ageBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonMary's colour of dress continues to shift and change throughout the series starting with beige tones.Maddie Close, who plays Jane Bennet in the upcoming series, says Mary's coming-of-age story and journey to self-acceptance is more relevant than ever.\"It is just so beautiful to watch her blossom and find herself,\" she says, adding that stories like Mary's are especially needed for teenagers trying to navigate the world and social media.Grace Hogg-Robinson, who plays Mary's sister Lydia Bennet, agrees, and adds that Austen's characters stand the test of time because people often meet them at important junctures in their life - for example, when studying Pride and Prejudice at GCSE.The actress believes Mary is \"much more relatable\" to a modern audience than some of the more iconic Austen characters, explaining that \"so many people feel like the person that no-one ever quite remembers\".\"It's really nice to tell that story,\" she adds.Poppy Gilbert, who plays Lizzy Bennet, says Mary is the sister she relates to the most and says others will too, thanks to her experiences of feeling \"constantly compared\" to others.Costume designer Sian Jenkins tried to demonstrate Mary's journey to finding herself through her wardrobe, which throughout the series transitions from creams and beiges to bold greens and reds, despite her mother, the infamous Mrs Bennet, berating her at every turn.Bruccoleri adds that the biggest journey her character goes on in the show is trying to find a way to remove herself emotionally from her overbearing mother. In order to do this, she has to learn to live without her \"approval or validation\" and give this to herself instead.Relationships and societyBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonRichard E Grant plays Mr Bennet and Ruth Jones plays Mrs Bennet in the new seriesBruccoleri says Austen's dry, funny writing provides sharp societal commentary without shoving its message \"down your throat\".\"Mrs Bennet just doesn't value Mary in the way that she values the other sisters, because she sees their values as so closely linked to their marriageability,\" she says.Molly Wright, who plays Kitty adds that Austen is \"so ahead of her time\" in her views on \"marriage and feminism\" in Pride and Prejudice.Hogg-Robinson, who plays Lydia, says that it took her time to realise \"how accurate and insightful\" Austen's works were after skim-reading them for her GCSEs and then picking them up later as an adult.She says that Austen's perspective on love and relationships continue to resonate, and points to a TikTok trend which centres on how Mr Darcy changes his behaviour to win over Lizzy in the original novel.\"Everyone was doing that [trend] 'Well, if he wanted to, he would', and Jane Austen got that 250 years ago,\" she explains.Modern AustenBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonBruccoleri says she would love if people were to finish the show and say \"I'm a Mary Bennet\"Screenwriter Quintrell feels very lucky to have contributed to a follow-on story in the world of Pride and Prejudice.While two centuries may have elapsed, \"the characters and the emotional journeys that they go on really feel like they haven't aged at all,\" she says.This, she feels, is why people like her and novelist Hadlow want to continue to extend the Bennets' story.Gilbert says the new series feels like a \"behind-the-scenes\" Pride and Prejudice, and that viewers can expect to see the siblings not just interact in ballrooms but \"yapping in the bathroom\" and looking after the family dog.Ultimately, Quintrell says it's really important to open the story of Pride and Prejudice out, because growing up, she felt the works belonged to scholars and academics and that she was not allowed to \"own\" the texts.\"Wherever you're from, wherever you grow up, you'll find something to connect to in Austen's work, and hopefully in The Other Bennet Sister,\" she says.The Other Bennet Sister is coming soon to the BBC.Additional reporting by Samuel Spencer.More weekend picks",

    "body": "'A nightmare' - The battle over Warner Bros is turning Hollywood upside down 35 minutes agoRegan MorrisHollywoodGetty ImagesDisaster, catastrophe and nightmare. That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said \"it's imperative that CNN be sold\".The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic. Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount, another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a tentative deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is \"superior\" to the Netflix deal.Getty ImagesWhether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.\"I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,\" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.\"Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,\" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. \"He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.\"Warner Bros objected to that characterisation. \"Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,\" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC. For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.\"Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,\" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.\"I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,\" he says.Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered \"the talkies\" in 1927.\"I think it's a disaster,\" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. \"This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.\"Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.\"At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,\" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect \"to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.\"Many in Hollywood want to believe them.Getty ImagesJohn Evans, a sound technician who dabbles in acting, writing and producing, points to Netflix's loving restoration of The Egyptian Theatre along iconic Hollywood Boulevard as a sign of their good faith.The Egyptian, a classic 1922 theatre, was the site of the world's first movie premiere – Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks – and had fallen into disrepair before Netflix bought the property in 2020 and gave it a $70m makeover.\"I think it's a good sign,\" Mr Evans said, adding that streaming is how many film workers consume movies and TV like the rest of the world.On the backlot at Warner Bros, tourists snap selfies in front of the Central Perk cafe set from Friends, and stroll by facades of buildings that stand-in for New York or Los Angeles. Inside the offices and writers' rooms, for those still working, it's business as usual.\"I've gone through seven mergers,\" a producer working on the Warner Bros lot said while developing a new show, explaining it's sad to lose a studio because it means it will be even harder to get shows made and sold with one less customer. \"But if you make good stuff, you make good stuff.\"The producer spoke on the condition of anonymity on the day that Paramount Skydance announced their hostile takeover bid. They said they were too busy to worry about the sale because they were trying to get a show on air – and they wouldn't be surprised if another billionaire or trillionaire made another offer for the studio by the end of all this. \"I joke about Elon walking in and doing this, but he could,\" they said of the Tesla and X owner. \"When you have people worth a trillion dollars, there are no rules.\"",

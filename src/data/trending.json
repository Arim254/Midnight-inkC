    "body": "3 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate.The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely.The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session.US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks.This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans.\"Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities,\" a White House memo to agencies said. \"It is our hope that this lapse will be short.\"Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal.Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents.\"We need to rein in ICE and end the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\"That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police.\"Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend.Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBrandon DrenonReutersLuigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare chief executive Brian Thompson, will not face the death penalty if convicted, a court has ruled.US District Judge Margaret Garnett dismissed the federal firearms charges against the 27-year-old that carried the possibility of the death penalty.He will still face stalking charges, which can bring a maximum punishment of life in prison.Mangione was arrested days after he allegedly shot Thompson as he walked into a New York City hotel on 4 December 2024. He has pleaded not guilty to all federal and state charges.After the ruling, Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo thanked the court for \"this incredible decision\", according to the BBC's US partner CBS News. \"We're all very relieved,\" Agnifilo said. \"We're prepared, and have been prepared, to fight this case, and we look forward to fighting this case.\"In her ruling, Judge Garnett, a Biden appointee, said two of the four federal charges did not \"meet the federal statutory definition of a 'crime of violence' as matter of law\". She noted that her decision was \"solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury\".Garnett's ruling was a setback for the justice department, which had called Thompson's murder a \"premeditated, cold-blooded assassination\".The judge has given the government 30 days to challenge her decision to rule out the death penalty in the Mangione case.In a win for prosecutors, Garnett said they could present evidence to the jury from Mangione's backpack that he had at the time of his arrest at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania.Among the items in the bag were a gun, fake IDs and a notebook with writings that allegedly detailed Mangione's grievances against the US healthcare system. Defence attorneys had sought to dismiss that evidence from trial, arguing that authorities obtained it illegally without a warrant. Mangione, an Ivy League graduate from a wealthy Maryland family, is also facing nine charges in a separate case brought by New York state prosecutors, including second-degree murder.Father-of-two Thompson, 50, was shot from behind by a masked gunman as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for an annual investor conference. Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Thompson's murder.Law enforcement sources say this may be a reference to the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients.Jury selection in the federal trial is due to begin on 8 September with opening statements due to start on 13 October. But state prosecutors are seeking to try Mangione as soon as July.In a separate incident, a Minnesota man was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly impersonating an FBI agent in an attempt to free Mangione from the Brooklyn jail where he is being held. The suspect - Mark Anderson - was carrying a barbecue fork and pizza cutter, prosecutors say. He is now being held at the same facility as Mangione.",

    "body": "10 hours agoIsabella Allen,Politics producer in ShanghaiandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersSeven new shops for Labubu dolls are to open in the UK this year, following the prime minister's trip to China.Chinese toy maker Pop Mart has confirmed it will open a flagship shop on Oxford Street in London's West End, as well as shops in Cardiff and Birmingham, before opening 20 more shops in Europe in 2026.The announcement is part of a package of deals announced by the UK government, including on whisky and cars, which officials claim is worth £2.2bn in export deals.Some have expressed concerns about Sir Keir's visit to China, arguing the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.Labubus are furry dolls wearing a signature spiky-toothed grin and became a viral purchase last summer, with celebrity fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian.The legions of fans are happy to queue to snap up the dolls, although to many their appeal is hard to explain. But their popularity has been a boon to Chinese soft power, with state news agency Xinhua saying Labubu \"shows the appeal of Chinese creativity, quality and culture in a language the world can understand\".Pop Mart founder Grant Wang, who expects to bring 150 new jobs to the UK, said: \"London stands at the heart of the global creative ecosystem, and we are thrilled to plant our European roots here.\"Sir Keir has made the first trip to China by a UK prime minister for eight years in an effort to thaw relations and cement trade deals with the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.On the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing, he announced an estimated  £2.2bn in export deals, as well as new investment.This includes a cut in tariffs on Scottish whisky exports to China, estimated to be worth £250m to the UK economy over the next five years, which will come into force on Monday.The prime minister also met the chairman of car manufacturer Chery, who confirmed the company will open a European headquarters in Liverpool.However, the Conservatives have argued Sir Keir's trip was not in the national interest and Reform UK has called on him to reject trade deals with China until British citizen Jimmy Lai is released from prison.Responding to critics, Sir Keir said: \"Engaging with China, is how we secure growth for British businesses, support good jobs at home, and protect our national security.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoRevelations from more than three million newly released documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein dominate the front pages of Saturday's papers. The Times reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor invited Epstein to visit Buckingham Palace two months after the financier was released from house arrest, according to an email from 2010. The email was sent from an account attributed to \"The Duke\" which appears to be linked to the former prince. The BBC has not been able to independently verify their authorship. Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing connected to Epstein, and the BBC has contacted him for a response. The exchange is among the latest batch of more than three million pages released by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday. \"Andrew invited paedophile to Palace a month after his release\" is the Daily Mail's headline. The paper reports that the email suggests the former prince promised Epstein \"lots of privacy\". The email is dated from September 2010. Epstein was released from house arrest in July of that year. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing and the BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.The Daily Telegraph follows with details from an email in 2010 between Epstein and an account named \"The Duke\", which appears to be linked to Mountbatten-Windsor. The message suggested Epstein wanted to introduce \"A\" to a \"beautiful\" 26-year-old Russian woman. The paper reports that the email was signed \"A\", with what appears to be an email signature that reads \"HRH Duke of York KG\". The BBC has not been able to independently verify their authorship. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor, who previously denied all wrongdoing related to Epstein.The Sun leads on the same story, with the headline \"Epstein fixed Russian girl for Andrew\".The Guardian focuses on documents that suggest Epstein sent thousands of pounds in bank transfers to Peter Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva in 2009. In an email to Epstein, da Silva sets out the costs of an osteopathy course, provides his bank details and thanks the financier for \"anything you can help me with\". Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his past friendship with the late sex offender. When asked for a response to the newly released emails, he said he had been \"very clear\" about his relationship with Epstein and has \"nothing more to add\".The Daily Star shifts its attention to Microsoft boss Bill Gates whose name also appears in the newly released documents. The paper says the new files reveal the billionaire reportedly caught a sexually transmitted disease 'from Epstein sex girls'. A spokesperson for Gates called the claims \"absolutely absurd and completely false\".The Daily Mirror's front page says Donald Trump's name also appears again in the new documents. Many of the allegations about the US president appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency, and were made without supporting evidence. When asked about the claims, the White House directed reporters to the part of the DOJ announcement which described some documents as containing \"untrue and sensationalist\" allegations against the president. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims.In other Trump news, the Financial Times reports that the US president has named Kevin Warsh as the Federal Reserve chair to succeed Jerome Powell when his term ends in May. Warsh has been an outspoken critic of the central bank and served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011.In news closer to home, the i Paper's latest polling shows \"half of UK voters\" want Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to be replaced. It adds that the figures show \"for the first time, the PM has lost the support of voters who backed him and Labour in the 2024 election\".The Daily Express shouts out its campaign for \"a proper Brexit\".Different allegations from the latest release of files by the US Department of Justice relating to Jeffrey Epstein are reported across the front pages.The Daily Mail and the Times highlight emails between Epstein and a man believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor inviting the disgraced financier to visit Buckingham Palace after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The latest batch of documents shows emails signed \"A\", with a signature that appears to read \"HRH Duke of York KG\".The Daily Telegraph and the Sun give details of the claim that the sex offender offered to set up a meeting between the man behind \"The Duke\" account and a 26-year-old Russian woman. The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing and the BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response. He has repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing connected to Epstein.The Guardian focuses on Epstein sending money to Lord Mandelson's husband, while the Daily Star hones in on lurid claims concerning the tech billionaire Bill Gates, which he has strongly denied. The Daily Mirror leads with claims relating to US President Donald Trump that the Department of Justice has described as unfounded and false.FT Weekend says Trump's choice to take over as the chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, has buoyed confidence in the dollar. The paper says he is well regarded on Wall Street.\"I lied to protect my mates,\" is the Daily Express headline as it says England's white-ball cricket captain, Harry Brook, has admitted that he wasn't alone during an altercation with a night club bouncer in New Zealand last November. The Daily Telegraph says Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue could also now be under investigation by the cricket regulator. The Times says the development raises questions over whether Brook can remain captain.The much-hyped documentary about Melania Trump - produced by Melania Trump - wasn't shown to reviewers before its release, so this morning's papers give critics their first chance to talk about the film itself.\"More outfit changes than the Devil Wears Prada, but we're no nearer unravelling the mystery that's Melania Trump,\" is the view of the Daily Mail. The movie isn't \"so bad it's good... it's just boring,\" concludes the Times. The Daily Telegraph describes it as \"Melania's North Korean-style propaganda, served ice-cool with a dash of Ralph Lauren.\" \"Two hours of Melania feels like pure, endless hell,\" is how the Guardian ends its zero-star review.Related Internet Links",

His life on the tracks started at British Rail when he was 16; he was then offered a job on the Metro, becoming its youngest train driver at the age of 19.The record had stood \"for all these years, not least because they changed the age limit for the role\", he said.The father-of-two said he and his wife initially went to Florida with their daughters but now go just by themselves, although sometimes they are joined by friends.\"We do all the rollercoasters every time we go,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor has said he has no plans to retire from thrill seekingTaylor admitted the cost of paying for air fares and accommodation so often did add up, but said he did not drink or smoke and bought annual passes to make it more affordable.His favourite ride was the Jurassic World VelociCoaster at the nearby Universal Orlando Resort, which has a launch speed of 70mph (113km/h) - 40% faster than the average metro.Although the lure of Florida has proved irresistible, Taylor has remained loyal to railways. He was a rail guard and then a train driver for 14 years before moving to a role training others.Taylor said it was \"an exciting time\" for the Metro when he started working on it in 1980.\"The Metro was a new concept for the region and millions of pounds had been spent making it become a reality,\" he said.\"I found myself at the age of 19 getting the chance to drive the trains when they were shiny and new.\"I vividly recall being told each one was worth a million quid.\"After that he then became operations manager and, most recently, a service delivery controller.\"All my working life has been on the railways, and it's given me a brilliant career,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor said he and his wife enjoy the food, the entertainment, the people and, most of all, the ridesTaylor said the \"shiny\" trains he started with were now old and \"were more like the rollercoasters where you get flung around\" but the new ones were \"much more smoother, quieter and more comfortable\".More on this story",

    "body": "6 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPhone lines are being opened and webchat services extended by the UK's tax authority on the final day before the self-assessment deadline.Millions of people who are self-employed or have more than one source of income are required to file a 2024-25 tax return online by the end of January.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has scaled up Saturday support for those leaving it to the last minute. Some 1.1 million people missed the cut-off a year ago.Previous excuses for failing to file have included being up a mountain or yachting around the world. Reasonable excuses for avoiding fines include serious illness or a close family bereavement.Anyone who fails to complete a required return by the end of Saturday faces an automatic £100 fine and the possibility of further penalties.More than 10 million people have already filed the latest tax return, according to HMRC, but thousands always leave it to the final day.The tax authority said digital services were the fastest way to access support on Saturday. A webchat was being extended to 10 times its usual Saturday capacity, with the digital assistant service running all day as normal.The telephone helpline, usually closed on weekends, is open from 09:00 GMT to 16:00 GMT for those who need to speak to someone about self assessment. HMRC has faced sharp criticism in the past for the time it takes to answer phone calls, and waits are expected to be relatively long on Saturday. Who files and who doesn'tMillions of people pay only have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file.They include those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.Some not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who have switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.Some people may be missing out on tax relief by submitting an incomplete tax return or not doing one at all.Sir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP, estimated that about 800,000 higher or additional rate taxpayers could be missing out on extra tax relief by failing to declare a personal pension or other \"relief at source\" scheme.Penalties can build upThose required to complete a return must also pay any tax bill.\"Filing the return is only half the battle - you must also pay any tax owed for the 2024-25 tax year by January 31 which will require sufficient cleared funds available in your bank account ahead of the deadline,\" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.Those who are unable to pay in full by January 31 may be able to set up a \"time to pay\" arrangement online if they owe less than £30,000 and meet the criteria.Anyone missing the filing deadline faces the following penalties: An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on timeAfter three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greaterThere are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 monthsIf tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owedHMRC will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a reasonable excuse may avoid a penalty.People should also watch out for scams, with criminals attempting to dupe taxpayers by purporting to be from HMRC. Fraudsters may threaten people, claiming they have an unpaid tax bill, or they may make offers of fake rebates.Digital overhaul from AprilFrom April, taxpayers with more than £50,000 of gross income from self-employment or rental income in the 2024-25 tax year will need to comply with Making Tax Digital rules which will replace self assessment. They must keep digital records using approved software and submit quarterly income and expense summaries to HMRC. The threshold drops to £30,000 from April 2027 then £20,000 from April 2028.\"Making Tax Digital is the biggest tax change since self assessment and, with just over two months to go, time is running out to get ready,\" said Victoria Todd, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which has produced a guide for those unsure of the changes.",

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel Muller HeyndykandChi Chi Izundu,Investigations correspondentNews SyndicationThe former prince, Andrew, left, has been criticised for his association with Jeffrey EpsteinEmails suggest that the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein invited a man believed to be Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman.The latest batch of documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to Epstein shows emails signed \"A\", with a signature that appears to read \"HRH Duke of York KG\".The emails were exchanged in August 2010, two years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor. The messages are likely to put further pressure on Mountbatten-Windsor, who has faced years of scrutiny over his past friendship with Epstein.BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The emails between Epstein and an account named \"The Duke\" on 11 and 12 August 2010 suggest that the American wanted to introduce \"A\" to a 26-year-old Russian woman, whom Epstein suggests he \"might enjoy having dinner with\".He says that the woman would be in London in August 2010. \"The Duke\" replies that he would be in Geneva \"until the morning of the 22nd but would be delighted to see her\" before asking: \"Will she be bringing a message from you? Please give her my contact details to get in touch.\"He asks Epstein whether there is \"any other information you might know about her that might be useful to know?\"Epstein replies that \"she [is] 26, russian, clevere [sic] beautiful, trustworthy and yes she has your email\".Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl in Florida and completed his sentence in July 2010, a month before the email exchange. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the emails.Also among the latest tranche of documents is an email exchange dated 27 September 2010 between Epstein and the account titled \"The Duke\".Epstein writes that he is in London, adding: \"What time woudl [sic] you like me and [redacted], we will also need/ have private time\".\"The Duke\" replies: \"I am just departing Scotland should be down by 1800. I'll ring you when I get down if you can give me a number to ring. Alternatively we could have dinner at Buckingham Palace and lots of privacy. A\".Epstein replies: \"bp pleease [sic].\"The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Mountbatten-Windsor for a response.Another document, from 2020, is a formal request for assistance from US authorities asking to interview the former prince as they believed that \"Prince Andrew may have been a witness to and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation\".They said documentary evidence \"has revealed information suggesting that Prince Andrew had knowledge that Maxwell recruited females to engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men\" and \"there is evidence that Prince Andrew engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims\".The letter also said: \"Prince Andrew is not presently a target of the investigation, and US authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has committed any crime under US law.\"Mountbatten-Windsor has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\".He has faced allegations, which he repeatedly denied, that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre as a teenager after she said she was trafficked by Epstein.He paid a financial settlement to Giuffre, who he claims to have never met, to settle a civil sexual assault claim in 2022.EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockSarah Ferguson, Mountbatten-Windsor's former wife, has not publicly commented on the latest release of emailsSome emails which appear to have been between Sarah Ferguson and Epstein have also been found in the latest release.One email dated 4 April 2009 - signed \"Love, Sarah, The red Head.!!\" - read: \"Hello Jeffrey. I am landing in Palm Beach in a couple of hours. Is there any chance on my quick layover, that I can get to have a quick cup of tea...\" The email goes on to discuss ideas for Ferguson's company, Mother's Army. The former Duchess of York refers to Epstein as \"My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you.\"The financier was still under house arrest when the email exchange was sent.In another exchange in August 2009, Ferguson emails Epstein again to discuss \"my Sarah Ferguson Brand\" and thanks the billionaire \"for being the brother I have always wished for\".The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response.The newly released email exchanges form part of more than three million pages of documents made public on Friday by the US justice department. More than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images are included in the latest batch. Their release comes six weeks after a deadline mandated in a law signed by President Donald Trump.Many of the documents are heavily redacted, with some files showing pages which are entirely blacked-out.",

    "body": "4 hours agoOttilie MitchellWatch: Nationwide anti-ICE protests draw large crowdsThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Minneapolis as part of nationwide demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) action after the fatal shootings of two US citizens by federal agents.Protests were also held in cities across the US, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, with organisers calling on Americans to stay home from work and school.The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have ignited local protests and caused public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties.Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. The first, Renee Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January.Organisers of the protest, called the National Shutdown, called for \"no work. No school. No shopping\" on 30 January and to \"stop funding ICE\".According to the group's website, the action was in protest at the deaths of Pretti and Good, as well as others killed by ICE including Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who was shot by an ICE agent in September 2025.Protesters formed the letters \"SOS\" on top of a frozen lake in south Minneapolis, while one group marched through the streets carrying a large-scale replica of the Preamble to the US constitution.Singer Bruce Springsteen also performed a newly released song in honour of Pretti and Good entitled Streets of Minneapolis, at a concert in the city. Getty ImagesDemonstrators spell out an SOS signal of distress on a frozen Lake Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis On Thursday Trump's border tsar, Tom Homan suggested the Trump administration could \"draw down\" federal forces in the state if local officials cooperate.\"We are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter,\" Homan said during a news conference. Homan began leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minnepolis after it was announced Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving the area.Speaking on Thursday evening, US President Donald Trump said: \"We will keep our country safe, we'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.\" About 3,000 federal agents were sent to Minnneapolis at Trump's directive.The DHS has said it is arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota, but critics argue migrants with clean records and US citizens are being caught up in the campaign.Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the immigration enforcement initiative has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called for a withdrawal of federal agents from Minneapolis.Getty Images",

    "body": "3 days agoAida FofanaWest Midlands Birmingham Children's HospitalDylan was diagnosed lymphoblastic leukaemia at two years oldFor seven-year-old Dylan Jeffs, opening Pokémon cards on a hospital ward became a lifeline during years of cancer treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital.Diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at two years old, Dylan spent much of his early childhood undergoing intensive chemotherapy. While isolated from friends, the trading card game offered comfort, distraction and a way to stay connected.His mum, Rachael, from Cradley Heath, said she knew something was wrong long before the diagnosis. \"He was constantly unwell as a baby. We were always calling the doctors,\" she said. \"One day 111 asked us to check for a rash – and that's when everything changed.\"An ambulance took Dylan to hospital, where tests confirmed the family's fears. \"When they said they were testing for leukaemia, my heart sank,\" Rachael said.\"All the symptoms pointed to it.\"Dylan spent more than three years in treatment and rang the end-of-treatment bell in April 2024, but months later he became unwell again. \"You're told relapse is unlikely, but that fear never really leaves you,\" Rachael said.\"I noticed he was more tired, not playing as much and my instinct was right.\"Dylan needed a stem cell transplant and, after his parents were ruled out as donors, a suitable cord blood match was found. \"We are so grateful he was given that chance,\" Rachael said. \"The transplant and recovery were incredibly tough, but he's come such a long way.\"Throughout it all, Pokémon cards played a surprising role: \"We'd buy packs for him to open in hospital so he always had something to look forward to,\" she said. \"They helped him reconnect with friends when he went back to school. \"His uncle even brought special cards from Japan after the transplant.\"Dr Divij Sachdeva, a clinical fellow at the hospital, said Dylan's resilience stood out. \"He's been through so much and was always so brave,\" he said.\"Hobbies like Pokémon can really help children cope - they offer comfort, spark conversations and bring a bit of joy into hospital life.\"Now back at school full-time, Dylan is still attending regular check-ups – and trading cards in the playground.More on this story",

    "body": "32 minutes agoSarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, DniproBBCKateryna left her village to protect her two young children from the fighting that continues along the front linesIt's not the electricity cuts that Yulia Hailunas struggles with most after the Russian airstrikes. It's the fact that it's so bitterly cold inside her own home.Like so many Ukrainians, she's had no central heating since Russia launched a wave of targeted attacks on the power grid in January.So Yulia now lives in a long, quilted coat and hat in her flat, and rests her feet on a saucepan-full of hot water to keep them from freezing. If that's not enough, she lifts weights for 10 minutes to get warm.When the weather outside is above zero, it's just about bearable. But later this weekend, the temperature in Dnipro is forecast to plunge below -20C.In Kyiv and elsewhere, it could be colder still.\"That's what's really scary, because all the heating pipes will burst and we won't be able to repair them again. It will be a catastrophe,\" Yulia worries.On Thursday, Donald Trump announced that Vladimir Putin had agreed to halt attacks on Ukraine's major cities during the \"horrendously cold\" snap, supposedly for a week.The US president called it \"very nice\" of his Russian counterpart to agree to an energy truce. But details were sparse from the start.The next day, the Kremlin clarified that Putin's burst of good will expires on Sunday, just as the coldest weather bites.Yulia, seen hanging a battery-powered bulb in her home, is worried the situation could worsenThere is usually a week or more gap between massive aerial attacks in any case, so it's unclear whether Russia has actually paused anything.There has been no major strike since 24 January, when hundreds of tower blocks in Kyiv lost power and heating.\"It has been quieter for a bit, but I don't know if that's linked,\" a doubtful Yulia says, suspecting the strikes will restart at any moment.\"I think Putin wants to turn people against their government, to have them say: 'Just give Russia anything to make this stop',\" Yulia says.\"He wants to break us, but it won't work.\"Ukraine's heating system is breaking down though.The Geneva Convention, the laws of war, bans attacks on infrastructure that cause excessive harm to civilians. But this is the fourth winter in a row that the energy grid has been targeted by Russia deliberately, leaving it more fragile and harder to repair after each successive strike.Engineers have been drafted in from Ukraine's national rail company and elsewhere, working around the clock to restore electricity, and to defrost and patch up the heating pipes that run beneath giant apartment blocks in Dnipro, Kyiv and beyond.An extended pause in strikes on the sector would provide a welcome break, but few Ukrainians trust Russia to deliver that.That's because, elsewhere, the deadly strikes have not stopped.On Friday, one person was killed and several injured when a bus in Kherson was hit by shelling, while there were multiple air raid warnings for drones.And all along the eastern frontline, the fighting is as intense as ever, still forcing civilians to flee their homes.Families who have fled their homes gather at a centre for the displacedIn Pavlohrad, about 40 miles from the front, we found families dazed after evacuating, abandoning everything, with no idea whether they'll ever go back.They were queuing to register at a centre for the displaced, offered a small handout of cash, food and toiletries by volunteers.Kateryna cried as she told me how hard it had been to leave Vasylkivka, where she had lived all her life. \"It's like abandoning a piece of yourself,\" she said.But she had to protect her two young children, scared by the explosions.\"Our village wasn't touched at first, but now it's a total combat zone. The drones are hitting every day,\" her mother Iryna described the Russian advance.\"One day there were 50 Shahed drones overhead.\"Trump sees the energy truce - a halt to massive aerial attacks on Ukraine's big cities - as a way of reducing tension as he pushes for progress in peace talks.He pledged to end this war \"in a day\" long ago but now admits doing so is difficult.Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions by halting its own strikes on oil refineries in Russia and its shadow fleet of tankers that move Russian oil around the world, evading sanctions.The trade pumps vital money into Russia's war economy, but Kyiv wants to show Trump its willingness in his peace efforts.Another round of negotiations is scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday, though it seems no senior US delegates will attend.The US has been talking up progress and Ukraine also claims only one major disagreement remains – albeit a critical one, over control of territory in the east.But Russian officials have been dampening expectations of a deal.\"Of course we are following the talks, we want some stability,\" Iryna tells me people here long for peace more than anyone. \"But how can we trust Russia not to stab us in the back?\"From the dark and the cold of this war, it does feel to Ukrainians like Moscow is just toying with Trump.The next days and weeks will test that.Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Paul Pradier",

    "body": "7 hours agoNardine SaadReutersCatherine O'Hara, the comedic actress best known for her starring roles in the Home Alone and Beetlejuice films, as well as her Emmy-winning turn in Schitt's Creek, has died aged 71. The Canadian star rose to fame through Toronto's Second City improvisation troupe and on SCTV, before making a name for herself in the US in 1988's Beetlejuice and as the matriarch in the holiday classic Home Alone.O'Hara, whose colleagues remembered her as a \"wonderful person, artist and collaborator\", who most recently appeared in the Emmy-winning comedy The Studio and HBO's The Last of Us.In a statement to the BBC, O'Hara's agent said she died  on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness.O'Hara made lightning strike twice in her career with indelible cinematic turns.In 1988's spooky satire Beetlejuice, she played Delia Deetz who led her possessed dinner guests in an enthralling song and dance performance of Day-O (the Banana Boat song).Two years later, in Home Alone, her panicked scream of \"Kevin!\" as she realises her mischievous eight-year-old son had been left behind during their Christmas holiday is among the most memorable moments from one of the most successful film comedies ever. Her young co-star Macaulay Culkin, now 45, paid tribute to his on-screen mother on Friday, sharing images of the two of them from the film and in later years: \"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you. I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"'I'm so proud of you' - O'Hara speaks at Macaulay Culkin Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonyThe Toronto-born actress got her foot in the door as a waitress at the Toronto Second City theatre franchise in the 1970s, before auditioning for a role with the famed acting troupe.She further developed her comedic chops after joining the cast of sketch comedy show Second City Television (SCTV) -  one of the most successful Canadian TV programmes ever - alongside the likes of Eugene Levy and the late John Candy.She has credited her Canadian roots with helping develop her sense of humour.In 2020, she told Rolling Stone that growing up Canadian didn't have the same sense of nationalism or patriotism that she saw in the US.\"And that's a good thing because it does make you look outside of yourself and be aware of the world and not take yourself seriously,\" she said.\"And I think Canadians have not only a sense of humour about others but also about themselves.\"Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney joined Canadians and fans across the world in mourning O'Hara.\"Over 5 decades of work, Catherine earned her place in the canon of Canadian comedy — from the iconic Toronto production of Godspell to SCTV to Schitt's Creek,\" he said. \"Canada has lost a legend.\"O'Hara also collaborated with Christopher Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy four times, including on the critically acclaimed mockumentary films Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, A Mighty Wind and For Your Consideration. Her role as character actress Marilyn Hack in For Your Consideration earned her the 2006 National Board of Review Award for supporting actress.In a statement to Variety, Guest said he was devastated and that \"we have lost one of the comic giants of our age\".O'Hara had a late career surge thanks to the Canadian comedy series Schitt's Creek that became one of the biggest hits of the Covid lockdown.The fish-out-of-water comedy show followed the wealthy Rose family as they abruptly lose their money and mansion, and are forced to move into a shabby motel in a deadbeat town they bought as a joke.Getty ImagesSeth Rogen and Catherine O'Hara presented an award together at the 2026 Golden GlobesO'Hara's character Moira was a particular delight, with her wildly fluctuating accent, outlandish fashion sense, and brilliant one-liners, like \"Never assume, Twyla, because when you assume, it makes an ass out of... both of us.\"Upon winning the Emmy Award for actress in a comedy, O'Hara thanked her co-stars Eugene and Dan Levy for giving her the opportunity to play \"a woman of a certain age - my age - who gets to fully be her ridiculous self\".Dan Levy who played her son David in the series, which he also co-wrote and produced, said it was a gift \"to have gotten to dance in the warm glow of Catherine O'Hara's brilliance\".\"Having spent over fifty years collaborating with my Dad, Catherine was extended family before she ever played my family,\" he wrote. \"It's hard to imagine a world without her in it. I will cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her.\"O'Hara had continued working until very close to her death, playing a therapist in HBO's sci-fi drama The Last of Us and an ousted movie executive in Seth Rogen's The Studio just last year.In The Studio she played Patty Leigh, a studio boss replaced by Rogen's character, who pursues more creative roles as a film producer and makes her way to the Golden Globes - a stage that O'Hara was no stranger to. She won a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek and was nominated for her role in The Studio at this year's awards.She is also nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty.Rogen on Friday said that when he first met O'Hara, he told her she \"was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen\" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies.\"Getting to work with her was a true honour,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"She was hysterical, kind, intuitive, generous… she made me want to make our show good enough to be worthy of her presence in it. This is just devastating. We're all lucky we got to live in a world with her in it.\"Film director Judd Apatow, replying to Rogen's post, added: \"Brilliant and kind. Riotously funny for fifty years. A really special person.\"O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch and sons Matthew and Luke, as well as her siblings Michael O'Hara, Mary Margaret O'Hara, Maureen Jolley, Marcus O'Hara, Tom O'Hara, and Patricia Wallice.With additional reporting by Jessica Murphy in Toronto and entertainment reporter Steven McIntosh.",

But as well as fans, he'd made some powerful enemies.The first thing al-Masarir noticed was that his phones were behaving weirdly. They had become very slow, with the batteries running out quickly.Then he noticed seeing the same faces appear in different parts of London. People who seemed to be Saudi regime supporters began stopping him in the street, harassing and filming him. But how did they know where he was all the time?Al-Masarir feared his phone was being used to spy on him. Cyber experts would later confirm he'd become the latest victim to be spied on with the infamous Pegasus hacking tool.\"It was something that I couldn't comprehend. They can see your location. They can turn on the camera. They can turn on the microphone, listen to you,\" al-Masarir tells the BBC. \"They got your data, all pictures, everything. You feel you've been violated.\"On Monday, after six years of legal battles, the High Court in London ruled Saudi Arabia was responsible, and ordered the kingdom to pay al-Masarir more than £3m ($4.1m) in compensation.The Ghanem ShowThe Ghanem Show still has 600,000 subscribers on YouTube, but the comedian has stopped postingAl-Masarir's iPhones had been hacked in 2018 after he clicked on links in three text messages seemingly sent from news outlets as special membership offers.It led to him being stalked, harassed and in August of that year, beaten up in central London.The court heard two strangers had approached al-Masarir and shouted at him, demanding to know who he was to talk about the Saudi royal family, before punching him in the face and then continuing to attack him.Passers-by intervened and the two men retreated, calling the YouTuber a \"slave of Qatar\" and saying they were going to \"teach him a lesson\".The High Court judge described the physical attack as premeditated and noted that one of the assailants was wearing an earpiece.\"There is a compelling basis\" that the assault and the hack \"was directed or authorised by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or agents acting on its behalf,\" Mr Justice Saini said in his written judgement.\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a clear interest in and motivation to shut down the claimant's public criticism of the Saudi government,\" the judge ruled.After the assault, the harassment continued. In 2019, a child approached al-Masarir at a Kensington café and sang a song praising King Salman, the Saudi monarch.This incident was filmed and posted on social media, began trending with its own hashtag, and was even broadcast on state-owned television in Saudi Arabia.On the same day, a man walked up to al-Masarir as he was leaving a west London restaurant and told him, \"Your days are numbered\", before walking off.Al-Masarir was born in Saudi Arabia but has lived in Britain for more than 20 years, originally coming to study in Portsmouth.He is now a British citizen and lives in Wembley, but no longer ventures far from home - going into central London is still frightening for him after he was attacked.The 45-year-old rose to fame in the Arabic-speaking world for his satirical YouTube videos criticising Saudi rulers, in particular the crown prince and de facto ruler Mohamed bin Salman.Getty ImagesAl-Masarir's videos often poked fun at the Saudi crown princeAl-Masarir's humorous takes - and sometimes personal and offensive attacks on the Saudi government - often went viral, generating more than 345 million views.In his most watched clip - which has 16 million views - he criticised the authorities for being angry about a viral video of girls dancing in Saudi Arabia. Mysteriously, the sound has been removed on YouTube and al-Masarir has no idea how or when the video was edited.Since al-Masarir was hacked and attacked he has lost his confidence and become depressed and fearful. The once funny and outspoken personality agreed to talk to the BBC - but was reserved and didn't want to fully show his face.He hasn't posted a video for three years and says in spite of his legal victory, the Saudi government has succeeded in silencing him.\"No amount of money can repay the harm this has done to me,\" he says. \"The hack has really changed me. I am not the same Ghanem I used to be.\"It was spyware experts from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab who confirmed al-Masarir had been hacked with Pegasus spyware. They sent an analyst to London and deemed it highly likely the hack had been orchestrated by Saudi Arabia.Pegasus is a powerful and controversial hacking tool made by Israeli company NSO Group. NSO Group insists it only sells its spyware to governments to help track terrorists and criminals.But Citizen Lab has discovered it on phones belonging to politicians, journalists and dissidents - including al-Masarir.When al-Masarir first tried to bring a claim against Saudi Arabia, the kingdom argued it was protected from legal action under the State Immunity Act 1978.But in 2022 the court ruled Saudi Arabia did not have immunity. Since, then the country has not been represented in any further proceedings.\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has failed to serve a defence or to respond to this application and has breached multiple further orders. It appears unlikely to participate in the claim,\" the High Court judge concluded.The total damages awarded are £3,025,662.83 but it's not clear if Saudi Arabia will pay.The BBC contacted the Saudi embassy in London but has not had a reply.Al-Masarir says he is determined to enforce the judgement and is willing to use international courts if necessary. But no amount of money will make up for how the hack has turned his life upside down, he says.\"I feel depressed that they got away with something like this in London - in Great Britain.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmer MoreauandJosh MartinGetty ImagesThe price of a flight on your phone is sometimes different to booking on a computerThe business model for many airlines involves charging attractively low prices for the actual ticket, but making customers pay separately for luggage, seat selection and priority boarding.And it is lucrative: add-on fees, or \"ancillary revenue\", brings in billions for these airlines every year.In some cases, passengers find paying the fees is unavoidable, especially if you're flying with children. But here's how to beat some of them.1. Be ruthless when it comes to packingThere are sometimes bargains to be had when it comes to carry-on bag charges, says Laura Anne Sargeant, who documents her holidays online under the name Travelling Page Turner. But in her experience never anything as low as the £5.99 suggested by easyJet.\"It's usually closer to £20,\" she says. easyJet has now been told by the UK's advertising watchdog to stop claiming this price is available, after it failed to provide evidence customers could bring a bag on for that cost.While budget airlines say they offer low carry-on prices, Which? found in the vast majority of cases they weren't available. The consumer rights organisation only found Ryanair's lowest advertised price (£12) accessible twice out of 634 flights it checked, and found Wizz Air's lowest price of €10 was available twice in 338 flights. To avoid a bill for carry-on luggage, Laura Anne is \"really ruthless\" with her packing.\"I'll use the hotel body wash,\" she says, \"I never take a hairdryer.\" Then if she is travelling with someone else they can share a case and split the cost between them.Laura Anne SargeantLaura Anne says you should think about whether you really need priority boardingWendie Smith from Bristol is more of a solo traveller. She is off to south-east Asia for two weeks soon but is only taking a backpack to avoid the charge for putting a bag in the hold.\"It's a soft backpack so it squeezes into their little cages a bit better than a solid one,\" Wendie said. \"And it unzips like a suitcase.\"Wendie SmithWendie is going to Asia for two weeks and is only taking a backpackBut her best-kept secret? \"Dry robes have massive pockets,\" she says.Designed for outdoor swimming fans, these large overcoats can hold a lot of extras and fit over a couple of jumpers. \"They can't tell you what to wear on a plane,\" Wendie says.Travel influencer Chelsea Dickenson also loads her pockets with heavier items rather than putting them in a suitcase for the hold. \"Airlines may weigh your bag, they don't weigh you!\"You can even buy vests with many pockets, marketed as a hack that \"airlines hate\".If you are taking a bag, the advice is to pay for it as early as possible.\"Prices can increase closer to departure,\" Chelsea says, \"and adding luggage at the airport or gate is almost always the most expensive option.\" 2. Double check the airline's cabin bag rulesChelsea warns holidaymakers to watch out for different rules at different airlines, particularly for luggage.Measure your bag and check the airline's website for precise limits. Don't just go with what your bag claims to be.\"A bag labelled 'cabin size' does not guarantee it meets the airline's rules. Wheels, handles and rigid shells can push bags over the limit.\"Helpfully, luggage firms have your back there. \"Companies have got savvy to this and created a whole range of bags where the wheels come off,\" Chelsea said.\"Wheel your case through the airport but when it comes to boarding, simply take the wheels off, pop them in your pocket and know that you're sorted.\"Chelsea DickensonChelsea Dickenson has been writing about travel since 2017. She recommends using pockets to their maximum capacity, like with this fishing vest3. Don't fall for sneaky sales tacticsClicking through the booking process can sometimes make it look as though you have to pay extra to reserve a seat.But if you do not need a particular seat and you are not bothered about sitting with your travel companions, you can just let the airline allocate you a place.Laura Anne also thinks paying for priority boarding is \"a bit of a con\".Many passengers worry that if they don't pay to board ahead of other people, and then there is no room in the overhead bins for their luggage, they will end up having to pay to put it in the hold. But Laura Anne says if that happens you will not be charged. You will have to wait longer for your luggage when you land, though.The booking process is also littered with offers of extra services.Laura Anne says that while there is sometimes value to be found in booking accommodation or transfers offered through the airline, this is rarely the case with insurance.\"Occasionally you'll find a [cheap] hotel or car hire ... but definitely no to insurance.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "11 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editor, ShanghaiPA MediaAt the heart of the strategy behind the prime minister's visit to China this week is what some describe as China's \"looking up economy\".What they mean by this is this is a tightly controlled state where the Chinese Communist Party is ever present. So, to deliver significant change the message from the top has to be abundantly clear, and when it is big shifts in outlook might then follow.Downing Street hopes Sir Keir Starmer's three-day visit, including meeting President Xi and Premier Li in Beijing and a subsequent trip to Shanghai, will be noticed.There has been no shortage of political and corporate glad-handing.The early indications, from Sir Keir's point of view, appear positive.As our China correspondent Laura Bicker has reported, Chinese state media, the mouthpiece of the Communist party, spent 18 minutes of its flagship 30-minute evening bulletin discussing the prime minister's visit on the day he met the president.And of the sporting and cultural organisations I have spoken to that have accompanied the prime minister on this trip, as well as the businesses, there is a hope this could be an important moment - that opens up new opportunities for them.\"As long as this isn't a one-off,\" one put it to me. This was not a \"one and done\" visit, the prime Minister's official spokesman told us.PA MediaSir Keir Starmer met President Xi Jinping in Beijing and announced agreements on visas and import taxesChina, meanwhile, can revel in the reality that it matters, as a parade of Western leaders pass through.Carney was to find out shortly afterwards how such a visit can go down in the White House if President Donald Trump reckons a country is considering getting too close to Beijing. The short answer: not very well. On the rhetorical Richter scale of presidential admonishments, this was seen by the prime minister's team as pretty minor, not least because later in the same exchanges Trump described Xi as a \"friend\".Sir Keir added, in an interview with me, that \"it would be foolhardy to simply say we would ignore\" China.Over the last few days of long flights and long days, I have seen a conviction in the prime minister's case on China. He clearly finds it absurd that there was an eight-year gap between this visit and the last one by one of his predecessors, Theresa May, in 2018.He sees these as wasted years and wants to make up for lost time. And he sees a dividing line with the Conservatives he appears happy to point out. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC the other day that were she prime minister now, she would not have come on this trip.So what can we take from what Sir Keir has managed to achieve?There has been no shortage of schmoozing and warm words. That is because both are fuel in this \"looking up economy\" I mentioned.And then there was an idea announced, but not yet delivered. The prime minister said the requirement for British visitors to need a visa to visit China for under 30 days would be scrapped. But the Chinese government said it was something they were merely \"actively considering.\" Sir Keir insisted to me it will happen, but acknowledged there was no start date agreed. \"We are making progress,\" he said.Ministers and the officials working on the minutiae of the negotiations are hopeful there can be a step-by-step ratcheting up of dividends associated with a closer, warmer relationship.But perhaps little wonder some are queasy about this warmth. Critics say China is simply a state that cannot be trusted.Others talk about Chinese cyber attacks or MI5 issuing an alert to parliament before Christmas over Chinese spying in Westminster.And to illustrate that lack of trust, everyone I have encountered on this trip, from government officials to the corporate and cultural delegation to journalists, have taken more electronic security precautions than on any other trip I have been on. Most are on temporary phone numbers and many have left their usual digital devices at home.Quite the backdrop, then, for a relationship being warmed up.PA MediaRepresentatives from British businesses and cultural institution accompanied Sir Keir on the visitBut having followed the prime minister, at home and abroad, for the nearly 19 months of his time in office, he has now set out his vision for foreign policy - and begun to match it with actions and visits.\"We have to engage with this volatile world\" is how he summarised his approach when I spoke to him. \"I don't think I have known a time when what is happening internationally is impacting what is going on back home so directly.\"He is stung and irritated by the label lobbed at him by critics who describe him as \"never here Keir\" because of the number of foreign trips he does. He has notably tried to push back on this trip, repeatedly talking about how events overseas have a bearing on the cost of living at home. He even made a reference to prices in the supermarkets when he was talking to President Xi in the Great Hall of the People.He describes the UK as having \"reset\" its relationship with the European Union post-Brexit and has done a trade deal with India. And now, here he is in China.Inevitably, if he leans too far in one direction, it limits his options in another. Rejoin the EU's customs union, and those trade deals with others would be gone, as he points out to his Labour colleagues who have called for just that.Be seen to get too close to China, and prepare for the verbal hairdryer from the White House.The trade-offs are legion.\"I'm a pragmatist, a British pragmatist, applying common sense,\" the prime minister told us on the plane, saying his desire was to \"make Britain face outwards again.\"Outwards and in multiple directions is his approach, moving incrementally.",

    "body": "13 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesGold prices have reached record highs recently, with investors piling money into the safe haven asset amid rising global political uncertainty.All have since fallen sharply after signs of political stability in the US, though they remain much higher than this time last year.Trump uncertainty shifting investmentGlobal trade has been upset by tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump on countries who wish to trade with the US but whom he sees as unfavourable.His trade policies continue to worry investors, helping to drive the gold rally, says Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown.In January, gold and silver prices hit record highs, but share prices fell as investors reacted to Trump's threat of fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland.Hamad Hussain, an economist at Capital Economics, said the perception gold is a safe investment, in contrast with the risks associated with US foreign and fiscal policies under Trump, has put the precious metal \"in the spotlight\".War and Greenland threats add to uncertaintyWars in Ukraine and Gaza have added to a climate of general political uncertainty. The US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro also pushed the gold price to blockbuster levels.Trump's Greenland threats heightened global political tensions and saw confidence in the US dollar plummet, with investors turning to precious metals as a safer investment. The biggest hit the dollar has faced during Trump's tenure was in the aftermath of his so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced last spring. \"Gold is doing what it does best when the world feels messy, jumping amid rising trade tensions, geopolitical flare-ups, political uncertainty in the US,\" Wall says.\"Fresh friction between the US, Canada and China, unease around Europe and the Middle East, and even shutdown risks in Washington have all added to gold's appeal.\"Central bank buyingCentral banks buying gold has been a key factor pushing up its price.\"Investors and global central banks have... favoured gold as their reserve currency of choice, which they believe insulates them from US policy dependence,\" says Wall.\"Certain nations will have observed the threat of Russia having its US dollar assets seized by global players supportive of Ukraine, and subsequently considered the metal a more attractive neutral reserve,\" she added.But while central banks are still buying more gold than before 2022, Hussain says, estimates suggest that demand actually softened in 2025.Other buyers of gold include China, which is the biggest buyer of gold, with demand in the country coming from individuals buying jewellery as well as investors.Investors in the west are also huge buyers of gold, with money flowing into firms on the stock market that own and trade gold.Hussein also says new buyers in the market have been picking up huge amounts of gold, adding to its dramatic rise recently. One example was Tether, a digital currency specialist which has recently purchased so much gold its reserves reportedly outsize those of some small countries.Why has the price of gold and silver fallen in recent days?Gold prices had been soaring to record highs in recent days, partly driven by fears Trump would choose a Fed chairman who would cave into his demands to cut interest rates, leading to a falling dollar and rising inflation. Buying gold is a strategy to protect against those things.But, as reports emerged the president would nominate Kevin Warsh, who is seen as a relatively safe bet compared with other candidates, gold, silver, and plantinum prices all slumped.However, precious metal prices are still much higher than this time last year because of ongoing geopolitical tensions, current tariffs and further tariff threats from Trump, and ongoing conflicts around the world. It means the shine of gold and silver feels more attractive than ever for investors seeking \"safe haven\" assets.One of gold's biggest appeals is its relative scarcity. Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery, told the BBC: \"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance.\"It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world.\"Friday's gold price volatility shows its value can fall almost as quickly as it rises, like all traded commodities.",

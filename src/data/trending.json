Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "1 hour agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "Is the snow and ice set to return again this January?Image caption, Snow in early January turned parts of the UK into a winter wonderlandByStav DanaosLead Weather PresenterIf you think we've said goodbye to bitter winter weather then think again. There's a battleground of air masses beginning to build across the UK and it's far from clear which will win out.At the start of January a spell of notably harsh winter weather brought Arctic winds southwards along with heavy snow, widespread ice and biting temperatures.A recent shift in the jet stream has allowed milder Atlantic air to be ushered in lifting temperatures to around the seasonal average. This sudden change introduced a different set of hazards, with frequent rainfall, strong winds and the rapid thaw of lying snow bringing about localised flooding in some areas.However, now we're entering a new phase with two competing weather influences and it's a waiting games to see which will dominate - more wind and rain, or more snow and ice.Image source, MarkieB / Weather watchersImage caption, Flooding from a combination of heavy rain on saturated ground and snow melt has led to disruption in placesWhen are we expecting a change to colder weather?As we push into the second half of the month there is a signal that temperatures could once again drop with an increased chance of snow for some.It's not that straightforward, however, as the UK is expected to sit right in the middle of two vying systems.On one hand an Atlantic low pressure system will repeatedly attempt to move in from the west, bringing relatively mild, moist air and unsettled conditions. At the same time, areas of higher pressure over eastern Europe and Scandinavia may intermittently push westwards, encouraging colder and more stable air to edge into eastern parts of the UK.Image source, BBC WeatherImage caption, The UK lies on the boundary of air masses for the foreseeable future, with colder air around high pressure towards the east of the country perhaps winning out later in the monthFor the next few days the Atlantic influence is likely to dominate. Many areas can therefore expect largely cloudy skies and changeable weather, with frequent showers or longer spells of rain at times.Temperatures during this phase are expected to be close to the seasonal average overall, reflecting the balance between mild-Atlantic air and occasional cooler interludes. Where skies clear overnight, especially in more sheltered or rural locations, there will be a continued risk of night frosts.As we head through next week the forecast confidence decreases but there is an increasing indication that colder conditions could begin to take hold.This would occur if high pressure to the east becomes more influential, allowing colder air to spread westwards across the UK.Should this transition develop, temperatures are likely to fall below average and the risk of wintry weather would increase. Any precipitation could potentially turn to snow — particularly over higher ground but possibly at lower levels too in some areas.However, the exact timing and extent of any colder spell remains uncertain at this stage. A colder than normal January?With the prospect of temperatures falling below average towards the end of the month, alongside an increasing likelihood of further snowfall, there is growing potential for a renewed cold spell. When this is considered together with the notable cold snap experienced at the start of the month, it raises the possibility that January as a whole could end up being colder than the long-term average.Such an outcome would be relatively unusual in the context of recent years. As the climate continues to warm, months that finish below average have become less frequent, particularly during winter, when milder Atlantic influences increasingly dominate. But does highlight how short-lived but significant cold spells can still occur and have a meaningful impact on monthly averages, even in a changing climate.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanFred Scott/BBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.Fred Scott/BBCThe Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.Additional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed",

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.The force said emergency services had attempted to retrieve the body, which was found among the rocks on the beach at Withernsea on Thursday at 08:30 GMT, but was unsuccessful due to tide times and other conditions.Specialist officers have been in contact with Grace Keeling's family and have asked people to \"refrain from speculation\" and \"respect their privacy\".Police said emergency services, including HM Coastguard, had cordoned off an area of Holmpton Road and remained at the scene.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"Officers and specialist teams have been working to explore every possible option in very complex circumstances to delicately recover the body.\"Due to tide times, conditions and the location, the recovery could not be immediately carried out and has therefore been paused until it is safe to resume.\"Darrin StevensA major search operation was launched on 2 January following reports of people in the waterA major operation was launched involving HM Coastguard, lifeboats and helicopters after calls to the emergency services at about 15:00 GMT on 2 January.Police have previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace Keeling and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".Ratcliffe was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene. Sarah Keeling's body was recovered later the same evening.In a tribute, Ratcliffe's family described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".Joanne Gee, a close friend of Sarah Keeling, said the 45-year-old \"left a mark with absolutely everyone she met\".Family HandoutMark Ratcliffe was described by his family as a \"selfless hero\"Humberside Police said no formal identification of the body had taken place but recognised the discovery had followed 13 days of \"extensive searches\" for Grace Keeling.Vickers added: \"I appreciate this update will understandably cause concern to members of the public.\"We have a dedicated team of specialists who are doing everything they can in their efforts to carry out the recovery as safely and as quickly as possible.\"Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaAn inquest into the deaths of Ratcliffe and Sarah Keeling was opened at Hull Coroners' Court on 12 January.The hearing was told that the results of a preliminary post mortem examination found Sarah Keeling died from drowning and head and neck injuries.She came from Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire and worked in sales.Ratcliffe, who was a retired warehouse worker and lived in Withernsea, died from drowning and chest injuries. He was originally from Bradford, the court heard.The inquest was adjourned to a later date.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoMallory MoenchWatch: 'The Islamic Republic will fall', says exiled crown princeThe exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident \"the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when\".Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would \"facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life\".More than 2,500 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a \"surgical strike\". He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.\"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,\" he said.\"With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.\"He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: \"I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people.\"Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executed protesters.He later said he had been told \"the killing has stopped\" - but did not rule out military action against the country. Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a \"precautionary measure\".Who is Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah?On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: \"It's for the Iranian people to decide.\"He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: \"I am trying to help them liberate themselves,\" he said.Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,595 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 17 children, 164 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 21 uninvolved civilians.It reports that another 22,104 protesters have been arrested.The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.",

    "body": "Lewis Hamilton's race engineer from the 2025 Formula 1 season has been moved to a new role at Ferrari.Riccardo Adami will take over as manager of the Ferrari driver academy and their programme for testing previous cars.A Ferrari statement made no reference to Hamilton by name, saying only: \"The appointment of the new race engineer for car number 44 will be announced in due course.\"The move comes after consistent speculation throughout the 2025 campaign there were communication problems between Hamilton and Adami.Hamilton, 41, always denied that was the case and insisted their relationship was fine, despite the impression left by a number of their conversations over team radio.The relationship with their race engineer is one of the most important for any driver. The engineer is the person the driver talks to over the radio from the car, they decide together on changes to improve a car's performance and at times the role is as much a counsellor as colleague.Before joining Ferrari, Hamilton worked with one engineer at Mercedes - Peter Bonnington - for all his 12 years at the team.Seven-time champion Hamilton had a difficult first season at Ferrari and spoke a number of times of his belief changes were needed within the organisation, without specifying what they were.Ferrari's statement added: \"[Adami's] extensive trackside experience and Formula 1 expertise contributes to the development of future talent and to strengthening performance culture across the program.\"Testing previous cars programmes have become important within F1 as ways of giving young drivers experience, with in-season testing in current cars heavily restricted.Hamilton was outperformed by team-mate Charles Leclerc during his first season at Ferrari.The Briton finished one place and 84 points behind Leclerc in the championship and was beaten by the Monegasque 22 times to seven in qualifying at an average advantage of 0.15 seconds a lap. Leclerc's average grid position was 5.6 while Hamilton's was 9.5.Hamilton was knocked out in the first session of qualifying for the final three races of the season.At the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi there was an apparently awkward between Hamilton and Adami, when the Briton told his engineer not to inform him who was ahead of him on track. Having been advised the car in front was Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, Hamilton responded: \"Stop telling me I'm racing people. I know I'm racing him, man. Just leave me to it. I'm racing everyone ahead of me.\"  Adami previously worked with both Carlos Sainz and Sebastian Vettel - and had an at-times strained relationship with the German.There were a number of times during the 2017-18 season, when Ferrari had a competitive car but let their title hopes slip away with a series of mistakes, when Vettel ran out of patience with the team's race operations.Sainz also questioned the team's strategy choices on a number of occasions during his four years at Ferrari.",

    "body": "Germany has returned two small fragments of the Bayeux Tapestry stolen by a German scientist during the Nazi occupation of France in 1941.The pieces of unembroidered fabric were discovered by historians in state archives in Schleswig-Holstein in northern Germany as they sifted through the collection of German textile specialist Karl Schlabow.The fragments were later identified as part of the Bayeux Tapestry - a 70m-long (230ft) embroidery that tells the story of the Norman conquest of England in 1066.The head of the archive, Rainer Hering, presented the mayor of Bayeux with the pieces of linen on Thursday, saying it was \"obvious\" they had to be returned to France.Schlabow, who died in 1984, is assumed to have stolen the fragments, each only a few centimetres long, when he was sent to Bayeux as part of a research team to study Germany's \"ancestral heritage\" - a racist and antisemitic project run by Adolf Hitler's Nazi SS.Although Schlabow died in 1984, historians from the Schleswig-Holstein archive carried out an inventory of his collection in 2023 and discovered \"a glass plate containing pieces of fabric\", Hering told reporters in northern France.Other documents were found alongside the collection and labelling on the glass plate made it possible to identify the fragments of fabric as those coming from the Bayeux Tapestry, he added.\"For our state archives service, it was obvious that these pieces of fabric taken by the Nazis 85 years earlier had to be returned to France,\" Hering told Ici Normandie.The fragments are thought to have been removed from the underside of the tapestry, which is made up of 58 scenes covering 20 years of history with 626 characters and 202 horses. It depicts William the Conqueror becoming the first Norman king of England by seizing the English throne from Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.The tapestry is due to go on display at the British Museum in London in September, under a controversial deal agreed between the UK and France.More than 77,000 people have signed a petition against moving the 11th-Century tapestry, arguing it is too fragile to travel.UK artist David Hockney said this week that the idea of transporting it across the Channel was \"madness\". For the renowned British artist, \"some things are too precious to take a risk with\".However, the British Museum has vowed to protect the historic tapestry. The UK government is insuring it during its loan to the British Museum for £800m. Given its significance in British and French history, the tapestry was added to Unesco's \"Memory of the World\" register in 2007.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKate Whannelpolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats have proposed introducing film-style age ratings to limit which social media apps children can access.Under the party's plan, platforms that use addictive algorithmic feeds or host \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users over 16 years old, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would be rated 18-plus. This approach, the Lib Dems have argued, would \"avoid the unintended consequences\" of banning all under-16s from using social media, as advocated by the Conservatives. In recent days, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is open to the idea of an outright ban, telling reporters that \"all options are on the table\". He said he would be watching to see how a ban recently introduced in Australia was working. The new Australian law, which came into force in December, requires certain social media companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and TikTok to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms. In order to ascertain a user's age, the companies can use government-issued identity documents, face or voice recognition or analyse online behaviour to estimate a person's age. The Conservatives have said that, if elected, they would follow the same approach as the Australian government and ban under-16s from accessing social media. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The internet is a Wild West, social media in particular, we don't want children to be on there.\" However, Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats' science and technology spokesperson, said the proposal for a \"blanket ban\" was a \"blunt instrument that doesn't work in a digital age\". She said it showed Conservatives \"just don't trust parents\".The Liberal Democrats have argued that their \"tailored approach\" would allow governments to \"quickly categorise\" newly-emerging social media platforms based on the addictiveness or harmfulness of their content. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Our message to social media giants is clear: if your platform spreads harmful content or relies on addictive and harmful algorithms, you should not be allowed anywhere near our children.\"This issue cannot be kicked down the road any longer.\"The party says that under its proposal, apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would be classified as unsuitable for under-16s \"unless these companies fundamentally rewrite their code to remove addictive algorithmic feeds and inappropriate content\". The age ratings would be enforced by media regulator Ofcom, who could issue fines for companies that do not comply. Peers in the House of Lords could get a chance to vote on the proposal next week, when the Liberal Democrats seek to add it as an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill.During the same debate, a group of cross-party peers will push a different amendment which would prevent under-16s from accessing social media. It has been tabled by Lord Nash, a Conservative former education minister, but is jointly-sponsored by Baroness Benjamin, the Liberal Democrat peer and former children's TV presenter; the Labour peer Baroness Berger and Baroness Cass, an independent member of the House of Lords, who is a paediatrician.Those involved in the amendment are optimistic it will pass.The NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) has urged  peers to oppose a total ban saying \"action is needed but a complex problem requires more than a blanket solution. Bans are not the answer.\"The charity is backing the \"film ratings\" approach, arguing that children and young people should be protected but not \"shut out from the online world and the benefits it can offer for connection, fun, learning and support\". The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of Molly Russell who took her own life at the age of 14 after being exposed to images of self harm and suicide on social media - has also expressed concerns about a social media ban.The charity has warned of \"unintended consequences\" including \"pushing harm to unregulated areas\". Some social media companies have argued that a ban would be difficult to implement and easy for users to circumvent. Apps such as TikTok and Instagram generally restrict accounts to those aged 13 or over.Some of the big platforms also put in place protections for teenagers.For example, teen accounts on Snapchat are private by default and public accounts are only available to those who are 16 or over.

    "body": "2 hours agoAlison Holt,Social affairs editorandJames MelleyAn employment tribunal has found a group of nurses had their dignity violated, after an NHS trust allowed a transgender colleague to use the women's changing room.This judgement - whilst only binding on those directly involved in the case - will be carefully analysed for its wider implications for the NHS and beyond, especially given it deals with the fault line between opposing views on sex and gender.At the heart of the case was the question of whether the nurses' rights were infringed by County Durham and Darlington NHS Trust when it allowed Rose Henderson, a biological male who identifies as a woman, to use the female changing rooms.The panel did not criticise Rose, and all the claims related directly to them were dismissed by the panel. Claims the trust had victimised the nurses were also dismissed.However, it concluded that although a transgender person has protections from discrimination and harassment, that \"does not translate into a positive 'right' on the part of a trans woman to use the female changing room (or for that matter of a trans man to use the male changing room)\".The tribunal rooted its findings in last year's Supreme Court ruling that in the 2010 Equality Act, a woman is defined by biological sex not gender identity.As the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land you would expect that, but it is not necessarily straightforward.In December 2024, a judgement in Scotland involving another NHS nurse, Sandie Peggie, who also complained about a trans woman colleague using the female changing rooms, came to a notably different conclusion.She was found to have faced harassment from the NHS trust for a limited period for how it handled her complaint, but claims of discrimination were dismissed. Sandie Peggie is appealing against the judgement.In contrast to the Darlington ruling, the Scottish tribunal appeared to work on the basis that that a trans person had the automatic right to use facilities aligned with their gender rather than biological sex. Immediately afterwards, legal experts questioned whether there is the case law to back this up.Although neither case would normally have impact beyond those involved, it is a sign of how the similarities and differences in these judgements will be picked over.Associate professor of law at University of Oxford, Michael Foran, thinks there will be more cases like this.\"Many organisations have been led to believe that there is a legal right to access single sex spaces based on self-identification,\" he says.\"Cases such as this show that this was a misreading which disregards the rights of women as set out in both equality law and the workplace health and safety law.\"Whilst the Darlington nurses have been describing their delight at the employment tribunal finding, the NHS trust is taking time before it comments.The gender critical campaign group, Sex Matters, says the Darlington judgement is \"clear and sensible\" - and that it should be a final warning to employers to \"return to sex-based policies and rules\"Translucent, a group which campaigns for trans rights, says employers have a duty to ensure everyone is accommodated and that \"while the Supreme Court ruling \"has made it harder\" for service providers, \"most people are inclusive, and cases like this are quite rare\".And these cases add to pressure on the government to publish new guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission on what this all means for businesses who are dealing with the day-to-day practicalities of operating toilets, changing rooms and other single sex spaces.",

    "body": "59 minutes agoMaia DaviesReutersZelensky called on Ukraine's allies to provide rapid shipments of missilesPresident Zelensky has called Ukraine's air defence supplies \"insufficient\", having revealed several systems were \"without missiles\" until Friday morning.\"I can say this openly because today I have those missiles,\" the president said, adding that the country had received a \"substantial package\" earlier in the day.His comments follow days of intense Russian bombardment of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which has left thousands of people without heating and electricity during a bitterly cold winter.Schools in Kyiv will shut until February, the capital's mayor announced later in the day, as the city continues to face severe energy shortages amid temperatures which have dropped as low as -19C.Zelensky called on Ukraine's allies to provide \"rapid deliveries\" of available missiles, and said shipments did not mean \"that winter will end for us tomorrow\".\"And it doesn't mean that tomorrow the enemy will stop bombing us,\" he wrote on social media.Ukraine relies on its Western partners for several vital air defence systems, which Zelensky said required a \"constant supplies of missiles\".\"Securing these packages takes enormous effort, blood, and human lives.\"He criticised countries that \"stockpiled\" such ammunition:  \"If we are at war, we really need it. And in some countries, there is no war.\"On Friday evening, he said Ukraine had \"intelligence information\" that Russia was preparing for large-scale strikes.\"Supplies are insufficient,\" he wrote on Telegram. \"We are trying to speed things up, and it is important that our partners hear us.Earlier this week, Kyiv declared a state of emergency in its energy sector and appointed former prime minister Denys Shmyhal as energy minister to tackle the situation.Ukrainian officials also accused Moscow of deliberately exploiting an extraordinarily cold winter.Shmyhal told Ukraine's parliament on Friday that Moscow was \"betting it can break us through energy terror\", and ordered state companies to increase their energy imports.Thousands of energy workers are racing to restore power across the country through repairing plants and substations bombarded by Russian strikes.Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko said most of the capital had been left without heating and a \"huge shortage of electricity\" for the first time in the war.He told Reuters news agency that electricity levels had dropped to less than half of what was needed.Curfews in the city, introduced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, have been eased to allow residents to access emergency hubs providing heating and electricity.Klitschko had suggested earlier this week that residents should leave Kyiv if possible, to help ease pressure on critical resources.Also on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian negotiators were on their way to the US for further talks on a potential ceasefire.He said he hoped proposals would be signed with the US during next week's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland \"if everything is finalised and if there is agreement from the American side\".Meanwhile, Russian strikes continued into Friday, including in the central Ukrainian city of Nikopol, where officials said two people had been killed.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoKevin Nguyen,Phil Leake andMerlyn ThomasBBCThe controversial US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has confirmed it suspended operations in Gaza after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect on 10 October.Despite being funded until November, the organisation said its final delivery was on Friday.The GHF has been heavily criticised after hundreds of Palestinians were killed while collecting food near its distribution sites. Witnesses say most were killed by Israeli forces.Israel has regularly denied that its troops fired on civilians at or near the sites and the GHF has maintained that aid distribution at its sites has been carried out \"without incident\".The group's northernmost aid distribution site, known as SDS4, was shut down because it was no longer in IDF-controlled territory, said a spokesman.Satellite imagery revealed it was dismantled shortly after the 10 October ceasefire came into effect. Images show tyre tracks, disturbed earth and detritus strewn across the former compound.\"Right now we're paused,\" the GHF spokesman said. \"We feel like there's still a need, a surge for as much aid as possible. Our goal is to resume aid distribution.\"Despite the group's apparent desire to continue there has been speculation the final terms of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel would exclude them.Meanwhile, analysis of UN-supplied data shows little change in aid collected from crossings after the ceasefire deal came into effect last Friday.The average amount of aid \"collected\" - defined by the UN as when it leaves an Israeli-controlled crossing - each day has increased slightly compared with the previous week, but it remains in line with September figures.UN data shows about 20% of aid leaving a crossing has made it to its intended destination since 19 May. More than 7,000 aid trucks have been \"intercepted\" either \"peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors\", according to UN data.Aid sources told the BBC they hoped looting would subside in coming weeks as law and order is re-established and the populace is given assurances the ceasefire would hold.A spokesperson from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said while it was critical for the ceasefire to allow for an increase in aid and other essential supplies, it was important to reach vulnerable Gazans, including in areas that were inaccessible until recently.OCHA has hundreds of community and household service points involved in distributing aid. It lost access to many, sometimes due to conflict and sometimes due to Israel denying it access.\"We need to re-establish our service points, we need looting to reduce, we need roads to be cleared of unexploded ordnance and we need safety assurances,\" the OCHA spokesperson said.",

    "body": "5 hours agoTheo LeggettBusiness correspondentPlans for a groundbreaking rare earths refinery in East Yorkshire have been abandoned, after the company behind the project decided to seek investment in the United States instead.Pensana has spent the past seven years developing a rare earths mine in Angola. The $268m (£185m) project, one of the largest of its kind in the world, will begin delivering raw materials in 2027.The company had planned to build a refinery at the Saltend Chemicals Plant near Hull, which would have processed the raw materials into metals used to create powerful magnets.These magnets would then be used in high-tech applications such as motors for electric vehicles, wind turbines and robotics.The project would have given the UK a strategic foothold in the rare earths industry, which is currently dominated by China. However, as first reported by Sky News, the plan has now been dropped.Despite what the name implies, rare earths are actually relatively common. The term is used to describe a group of chemically similar minerals which are abundant in the Earth's crust – but which are also comparatively difficult and costly to extract.However, according to Pensana, China has in recent years used its market power to keep prices artificially low in order to stifle potential competition – and this has made refining in the UK uneconomic without significant government support.Speaking to reporters on Thursday at a meeting of the International Monetary Fund, Chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked about growing tension between the US and China over rare earths. The chancellor said she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".In 2022, Boris Johnson's announced plans for \"a multi-million pound investment\" in the Saltend project - launched alongside the then Tory government's 'Critical Minerals Strategy'. However, according to Pensana's founder and chairman, Paul Atherley, this contribution – actually £5m - was \"nowhere near enough\", and the Treasury proved unwilling to contribute more.Mr Atherley compares this with a deal between the US government and MP Materials, under which MP will benefit from more than half a billion dollars worth of investment and soft loans to fund a similar facility in California, as well as a 10-year agreement to ensure all the magnets it produces are sold for a minimum price.Earlier this year Pensana announced plans to team up with the US refiner ReElement, to develop a \"sustainable, independent rare earth supply chain\". It is also planning to list its shares on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Mr Atherley insists he remains \"very positive on the UK\". Another company he is involved in, Tees Valley Lithium, is pushing ahead with plans for a lithium refinery in the Northeast.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporter andJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaChinese state operatives present a daily national security threat to the UK, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum has said.In a speech, he said MI5 had intervened operationally to disrupt Chinese activity of national security concern in the past week.Addressing a row over the collapse of a case involving alleged spying on behalf of China in the UK, Sir Ken said the alleged activity was disrupted by MI5 and that it was \"frustrating when prosecutions fall through\".The government and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are facing questions over the collapse of the case.The unanswered questions after release of China spy evidenceWhat was alleged against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry in China spy case?Decision on China mega embassy site delayed againThe controversy over the collapsed China spy case explainedMI5 operating in new era of terror and state threats, says chiefThe CPS dropped the case last month after deciding the evidence did not show China was a threat to national security.But witness statements from the UK's deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins - published late on Wednesday - are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK, raising questions for the government and the CPS about why the prosecutions did not go ahead.In the documents, he said China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" against the UK and was \"the biggest state-based threat to the country's economic security\".Sir Ken described Mr Collins as a \"man of high integrity and a professional of considerable quality\".In his speech, Sir Ken said \"Chinese state actors\" presented a threat to UK national security but added that the \"overall balance\" of the UK's relationship with China  was \"a matter for the government\". \"When it comes to China, the UK needs to defend itself resolutely against threats and seize the opportunities that demonstrably serve our nation,\" he said.The Conservatives have accused the government of allowing the spy case to collapse to avoid jeopardising economic relations with China.Downing Street said it would have been \"absurd\" for the PM to step in last month after being told the case was going to collapse, stressing it was a \"criminal matter\" for the CPS to handle independently.In a letter to the prime minister, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the events leave \"a strong impression that your government undermined Britain's national security because you are too weak to do anything other appease China\".In his reply, Sir Keir argued that the prosecution's case relied on the then Conservative government's policy towards China at the time of the alleged offences, between 2021 and 2023.\"In other words, the prosecution's case required demonstrating that the position of the then Conservative government was that China was an enemy of the United Kingdom,\" he said, and it was \"plainly wrong\" to suggest that had been the case.The head of the CPS Stephen Parkinson is also in the firing line, with MPs suggesting there was sufficient evidence to put the case before a jury.He is reported to have told senior MPs on Wednesday that the evidence was \"5%\" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction.The Conservatives have written to the CPS to ask what evidence it had wanted the government to provide. And the chairs of four parliamentary committees have written to Mr Parkinson asking for \"a fuller explanation for the dropping of charges\".Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the foreign affairs committee, told the BBC's World at One: \"I can't see that the jury would have had any problem deciding that China was a threat.\"I really don't understand why they [the CPS] were being so pusillanimous about it.\"Another signatory, Labour MP Matt Western, has said the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy is launching a formal inquiry into the case. PA MediaChristopher Berry (left) and Christopher Cash (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaIn the first witness statement, sent in December 2023, Mr Collins outlines the case against former parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33.The pair are accused of collaborating with a Chinese Communist Party leader who was deputy director of the Central National Security Commission, chaired by President Xi Jinping.In one message, Mr Cash is alleged to have told Mr Berry: \"You're in spy territory now.\" Both men deny any wrongdoing.The second witness statement, written by Mr Collins in February 2025, after Labour had taken power, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\".A third witness statement published in August this year restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the two statements submitted under Labour made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\".China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said: \"China's position is very clear: we firmly oppose peddling China spy narratives and vilifying China.\"In a Commons debate, former Security Minister Tom Tugendhat, for whom Mr Cash was a parliamentary researcher, accused the government of being obsessed with following the correct process, rather than doing everything it could \"to make sure the prosecution works\".\"Who the hell's side are you on?\" he asked the government.In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he had been placed in an \"impossible situation\" because he had not \"had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence\".He added: \"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"In a separate statement, Mr Berry said: \"I pleaded not guilty to the charge, and I have been acquitted.\"My reports were provided to a Chinese company which I believed had clients wishing to develop trading links with the UK. \"Those reports contained no classified information… and drew on information freely in the public domain, together with political conjecture, much of which proved to be inaccurate.\"I do not accept that, in so doing, I was providing information to the Chinese Intelligence services.\"Tory MP Tom Tugendhat: \"Who the hell's side are you on?\"The third witness statement includes the words \"we will co-operate where we can, compete where we need to, and challenge where we must\".Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who also previously employed Mr Cash as a parliamentary researcher, noted that the phrase was \"a direct lift\" from Labour's manifesto.\"It's very hard to believe there was no political interference,\" she added.\"In my view, the Crown Prosecution Service should have proceeded with this.\"The case law shows it's for a jury to decide if China is or could be a threat to our country.\"BBC News understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Mr Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.The director of public prosecutions has said there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought but a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said the witness statements raised \"yet more unanswered questions\", adding: \"We clearly need a statutory public inquiry to get to the bottom of this whole fiasco.\"",

    "body": "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said a new anti-drone system should be \"fully operational by the end of 2027\", as part of a drive to toughen defences against Russia and be fully prepared for possible conflict by 2030.\"Drones are already redefining warfare. Having drone defences is no longer optional for anyone,\" Kallas said, referring to Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and fears that Moscow may attack the EU.The European Commission's \"defence roadmap\" also proposes strengthening the EU's eastern borders and building air and space \"shields\".Several EU nations have faced Russian incursions into their airspace and US President Donald Trump has urged the bloc to do more to defend itself.The European defence plan comes amid growing European fears that Russia will continue its westward aggression after the war in Ukraine is over, as well as continued ambiguity over Trump's long-term commitment to European security.\"Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends. It is clear we need to toughen our defences against Russia,\" Kallas told reporters in Brussels on Thursday.Although there seems little chance of the war ending soon, Trump says he is now having a \"lengthy\" conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone, ahead of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday. Trump has indicated that if Putin does not not move to end the war, the US could send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles - a potential move already described as \"escalation\" by the Kremlin.Standing alongside Kallas, European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius stressed that \"our roadmap shows all the major milestones to achieve defence readiness by 2030, so we can deter Russian aggression, prevent war and preserve peace\".Putin has repeatedly denied that Moscow has any aggressive plans towards the EU. In June, he said the \"myth that Russia is planning to attack Europe, Nato countries is an unbelievable lie... nonsense\".The EU's executive Commission said the 27-member union should be ready by 2030 to \"respond to any crisis, including high-intensity conflict\".It also urged the bloc to \"close critical capability gaps\" - including in air and missile defence, and artillery systems - \"through joint development and procurement\".Many EU countries are also members of Nato and its chief, Mark Rutte, said they were working together to protect member states on the eastern flank from aerial threat.The EU stressed its \"flagship\" projects would be developed in \"close co-ordination\" with Nato, and would not duplicate the Western defensive alliance's work.No estimates were given to the overall cost, but Kubilius said \"we're not talking here about hundreds of billions\".The \"defence roadmap\" still needs to be approved by member states at a leaders' summit next week. However, a number of EU states have already backed plans for a multi-layered \"drone wall\" to quickly detect, then track and destroy Russian drones.In recent weeks,  tensions have escalated between the EU and Russia, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones had breached their airspace.And Estonia - another Nato member - in September requested urgent consultations  with other alliance members after saying that Russian warplanes had violated its airspace and stayed there for 12 minutes.Russia, which launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, said its planes were on a \"scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states\".A number of European politicians and military experts have said that Russia's aim is to test Nato's capabilities and and try to sow discord within the alliance. Several Nato members reacted to the reported Russian incursions by sending troops, artillery, and air defence systems to secure the alliance's eastern flank.",

    "body": "6 hours agoHugh SchofieldIn ParisAFP via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu has had a turbulent start to his job, having resigned last week as prime minister before being reappointedFrance's new prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, has bought himself breathing space after winning two no-confidence motions tabled by the opposition.In the tightest vote, a motion sponsored by the far left fell 18 votes short of the 289 needed to bring him down. It means that after just five days in office, Lecornu has survived a first major ordeal in parliament and can now focus on the task of passing the 2026 budget.Any relief for the prime minister is likely to be short-lived, with the far left and far right still gunning to bring him down. And the Socialists, who threw a lifeline in the no-confidence motions, have made clear they will not be so indulgent next time round.Also, any tactical victory enabling the government to endure for now is more than offset by the huge damage to France's reputation caused by weeks of confusion and capitulation.Appointed by President Emmanuel Macron four weeks ago, then re-appointed in chaotic scenes on Friday after he resigned on Monday, Lecornu only survives thanks to major concessions made to the left.To buy the support of the Socialist Party, which has 65 or so MPs, the prime minister promised to freeze Macron's most important economic reform of his second term – the raising of the retirement age to 64.But he also made another, possibly more important, gift to the opposition, which has big implications for the chances of obtaining a budget in time for the end-of-year deadline.By pledging not to resort to the constitutional device known as the 49:3 – which lets governments force through laws without a vote – Lecornu handed ultimate control over the budget to the parties in parliament.It is a huge shift in power, reflecting the decline of presidential authority since Macron's botched parliamentary dissolution of July 2024.  For many observers  it heralds a return, for good or ill, to the party politicking that was a hallmark of the pre-1958 Fourth Republic.By assuring MPs that they and not the government would have the last word on the future budget, Lecornu managed to convince the Socialists that he was serious about marking a real \"rupture\" from previous Macronite administrations.But he may also have surrendered any prospect of the kind of belt-tightening debt reduction that the money markets and the European Union are demanding.The draft budget tabled by Lecornu on Tuesday aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7% of economic output (GDP) by making savings of €30bn (£26bn), with a squeeze on spending in the health sector and local administration.But the Socialists have joined the rest of the left and the far-right in denouncing the text as a betrayal of the less well-off.   Party leader Olivier Faure said that he would have no compunction about supporting a new vote of censure, if offending parts of the budget are not removed.AFP via Getty ImagesMathilde Panot's radical-left France Unbowed sponsored one of the two failed no-confidence motionsFrance's National Assembly has been split three ways for the last 15 months, with a centre-right bloc of under 200 MPs facing a left-wing alliance of about the same size and a far-right bloc of about 140, plus some independents.  None of the three prime ministers since then has been able to find a reliable majority.Weeks of bickering in Paris have triggered warnings about the public's growing disillusionment with politics - the spectacle appearing to confirm the notion that the prime aim of most politicians is simply to stay in power.President Macron, who is blamed for the crisis by most French voters, has seen his popularity ratings slump to just 14%. He has been in office for eight years, and the far right and far left have called for his resignation before his second term ends in 18 months.According to his one-time adviser, the veteran essayist and confidant of presidents Alain Minc, Macron \"must now go down as the worst president of the Fifth Republic\".Minc said Macron had come to office promising to act as a bulwark against the far right but he had left National Rally at the gates of power.\"If you look around us,\" said Minc, \"the Germans are petrified about what a French collapse will do to the economy. The British are petrified about the strategic implications. The Italians are laughing at us, because we always laughed at them.\"\"In America, President Trump is saying that smooth-talker Macron has got what he deserves. Only in Russia are they smiling.\"",

It's just a dream right now, but sometimes dreams come true.\"Hudson said: \"It's amazing to see that Sharon is backing the idea.\"The campaign is growing and growing and there's even more momentum now with Sharon on board.\"Dan HudsonDan Hudson is determined to persuade Birmingham Airport to change its nameEdward Fitter, one of the campaign's supporters and a member of Birmingham City Council, said: \"Ozzy's legacy deserves to be remembered here in the West Midlands. \"We already have Ozzy the bull at Grand Central, which is fantastic, and with his family's support we should continue to celebrate his contribution to music and to Birmingham's global identity.\"Brand expert Andy Barr said renaming the airport would \"work on every level\" and give a \"feel-good boost\" to the region. He said that changing an airport's official name and code would come with costs and logistical challenges, but it could be achieved \"through a public and private partnership\".Birmingham Airport said it was \"currently progressing an exciting homage to Ozzy Osbourne\" and was \"committed to honouring his legacy\" in its terminal.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoSean SeddonEPABenjamin Netanyahu addressed a memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl cemetery in JerusalemIsrael's prime minister has told a memorial for victims of the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 that he is \"determined\" to secure the return of the dead hostages still in Gaza, and that the country will continue to fight terrorism with \"full force\".Benjamin Netanyahu made the comments hours after Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages but said it was not able to access the remaining 19.There has been fury in Israel that Hamas has not returned all the bodies in line with last week's Gaza ceasefire deal, though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.Also on Thursday, Donald Trump signalled he was willing to see fighting resume if Hamas \"continues to kill people\".Writing on his Truth Social platform, the US president said \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill\", seemingly referencing reports of violence inside Gaza, where Hamas has been accused of violently targeting internal rivals in recent days. Trump has previously ruled out putting American soldiers on the ground in Gaza.Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli government confirmed that two bodies handed over by Hamas to the International Committee of the Red Cross on Wednesday night had been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash.Their return, which was overseen by masked Hamas gunmen in Gaza City, took the number of dead hostages returned since Monday to nine out of 28. All 20 living hostages were released on Monday, in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas's military wing said on Wednesday that it would continue to search for the remaining bodies, but that it would require major efforts and specialist equipment.Israel has responded to the delay by threatening to restrict the amount of aid flowing into Gaza.On Thursday, Netanyahu addressed an official memorial ceremony at the Mount Herzl national cemetery in Jerusalem, two days after the Hebrew calendar anniversary of the 7 October attack.The prime minister said he remained committed to securing the return of all the dead Israeli and foreign hostages, and reiterated his government's willingness to return to military action if Israel was attacked again.He said: \"Our fight against terrorism will continue with full force. We will not allow evil to raise its head. We will exact the full price from anyone who harms us.\"The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,967 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.ReutersIsraeli Bedouin soldier Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atarash was buried on Thursday, a day after his body was returned by HamasThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel said Netanyahu's government should \"immediately halt the implementation\" of the ceasefire deal until the 19 bodies were returned. After Hamas said it was unable to retrieve all the bodies, two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump said preparations to move to the next phase of the ceasefire deal were continuing. The advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains, and said the group had acted in good faith by sharing information with interlocutors.While the full text of the agreement between Israel and Hamas has not been made public, a leaked version which appeared in Israeli media appeared to allow for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible. One senior US adviser pointed to the level of destruction in Gaza as one reason the search might be slowed, and said rewards could be offered to civilians with information about the location of remains. Hamas has complained to mediators that more than 20 people have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on Friday.Israel's military, which still controls more than half the territory, has said that it opens fire to remove threats to its troops.Meanwhile in Gaza, work is under way to identify the bodies of Palestinians returned by Israel in recent days in exchange for the hostages' bodies. A further 30 were returned on Thursday, taking the total to 120.There had been some reports that the Rafah crossing with Egypt would reopen on Thursday, having been shut since the Gaza side was seized by Israeli forces in May 2024.The ceasefire deal specifies its reopening would be \"subject to the same mechanism implemented\" during a temporary ceasefire earlier this year, when wounded Palestinians were briefly allowed to pass through to receive medical treatment.On Thursday, an official from Israeli military body Cogat said: \"The date for the opening of the Rafah crossing for the movement of people only will be announced at a later stage, once the Israeli side, together with the Egyptian side, completes the necessary preparations.\"The official also stressed that \"aid will not pass through the Rafah crossing\". Instead, they said, it would continue to enter Gaza through the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Israel and other crossings following Israeli security inspections.",

    "body": "5 hours agoFaisal IslamEconomics editorWatch: Government will be taking targeted action on cost of living, says ReevesChancellor Rachel Reeves has said she is planning \"targeted action to deal with cost of living challenges\" in next month's Budget.Speaking to the BBC, she said it was the job of both the government and the Bank of England to reduce inflation.The UK's inflation rate is forecast to be the highest among the G7 group of developed nations this year and next.The BBC understands that the government could intervene to bring down energy bills, for example, by cutting the current 5% rate of VAT charged on energy.Another option is to reduce some of the regulatory levies currently added to bills.The government will receive the next draft from the official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), on Monday, which will reveal how much space there is for such a measure.The expectation from most analysts is that Reeves will have to announce tax rises or spending cuts in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rulesEarlier on Thursday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated there was a £22bn gap for the chancellor to fill, which is at the lower end of expectations.\"There's a shared job between the Bank of England and the government to bear down further on some of the causes of inflation,\" Reeves told the BBC in Washington, at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.While much of the focus has been on likely tax rises, the chancellor said the latest information from the OBR had not changed her commitment to manifesto promises not to raise rates on income tax, VAT or National Insurance.She blamed an \"uncertain world\" with rising geopolitical and trade concerns for the Budget tax moves, likely to be focused on those \"with the broadest shoulders\".Referring to the concerns about the UK's economic relations with China she said: \"Our national security always come first.\"Last week's announcement by China to tighten export controls on rare earths and other materials that are key for advanced tech manufacturing led US President Donald Trump to threaten an additional 100% tariff on imports from China, raising the prospect of an all-out trade war between the two economic giants.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called China's move \"economic coercion\" and \"a global supply chain power grab\".Asked about accepting the US offer to join it in its battle with China, Reeves said she was \"very concerned\" by China's actions and urged the Chinese government \"not to put up barriers and restrict access\".She said the move was \"bad for the global economy and creates further headwinds\".\"I believe there are areas where we must challenge China, but there are also important opportunities to sell into Chinese markets, including financial services and other areas of the economy. We've got to get that balance right.\"The chancellor also confirmed she was working with G7 counterparts \"on our own critical minerals strategy, so that we are less reliant\".Reeves also acknowledged that the price the NHS pays for medicines could go up as a result of ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and its drugs companies, in return for lower tariffs and investment.Some of the world's largest drug companies have said recently that they are either pausing or scrapping projects in the UK, with some blaming the low prices they are receiving.Last month, Science Minister Patrick Vallance said the price the NHS pays for medicines would need to rise to stop companies and pharmaceutical investment leaving the UK.Reeves told the BBC: \"We have seen because of the pricing regime, that clinical trials, new drugs have not been offered in the UK in the way that they are in other European countries.\"We want to make sure that people getting treatment from the NHS are able to access the best life-saving drugs in the world. And so we are looking at all of that, and… looking to secure more investment into Britain.\"",

    "body": "Manchester Pride headliner 'yet to be paid for performance'6 hours agoPete AllisonBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThousands attended this year's Manchester Pride, one of the UK's biggest LGBT eventsAt least one of Manchester Pride's headline acts hasn't been paid for their performance, BBC Newsbeat has been told.The event, organised by an independent charity, took place at the end of August. Several performers and businesses say their requests for payment have been met with silence, and Newsbeat understands one artist who topped the line-up has not been paid.After being approached for a response, organisers posted a statement on Instagram saying they were taking legal and financial advice to determine \"the best way forward\".'No communication, no answers'Saki Yew, who was on RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2024, is among those who say they're yet to be paid by Manchester Pride, which is one of the country's biggest LGBT events.\"It's gone too far,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"As performers, we're used to waiting for money but there's no communication and no answer.\"A lot of performers are starting to give up hope of being paid.\"Getty ImagesDrag Race UK's Saki Yew performed at Manchester Pride and has had no response from organisers about being paidManchester Pride booked Saki as part of a collective which, the drag queen says, is owed a \"big sum of money\".\"We put in the hard work with weeks and weeks of rehearsals,\" she says.\"We put in the time so give us an answer.\"Saki says she'd typically expect payment for similar work to take two weeks but frustration built after \"hearing nothing\" from organisers.'Questions and emotions'Newsbeat's also spoken to businesses waiting on payment after being hired by Manchester Pride.Chris O'Connor, a sole trader who worked backstage at this year's event, says he's taking organisers to a small claims court over £2,050 he says he's owed.He tells Newsbeat he couldn't afford a planned trip to visit his son in Ireland after Manchester Pride didn't pay him promptly.Another supplier, who wished to remain anonymous, said they have \"no expectation\" of receiving nearly £1,000 for signage their company provided.Getty ImagesOlly Alexander headlined this year's Manchester Pride alongside former Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne and Nelly FurtadoOnly Pride events in London and Brighton typically draw bigger crowds than those in Manchester.While marches, protests and rallies form a major part of Pride around the world, live music and performances are put on to draw even bigger crowds.Parts of Manchester Pride are free to attend but ticket prices for others varied from £15 to over £200 for \"VIP experiences\".Headliners this year included former Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne, Nelly Furtado and Olly Alexander.Newsbeat contacted Manchester Pride to share Saki, Chris and other people's experiences and offer the charity an opportunity to comment.Its Instagram statement said it knew \"moments like this can raise questions and emotions\".\"We ask that people treat our staff, from the CEO to the interns and volunteers, with kindness and respect,\" it continued.\"It is the board that takes responsibility for our decisions based on advice and guidance, and not our staff.\"Manchester Pride added that it hopes to provide more information by 22 October.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "3 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent andPaul SeddonPolitical reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe proposed new embassy at Royal Mint Court would be the biggest in Europe if it goes aheadA decision on whether to approve China's application for a new super-embassy in London has been delayed again by the government.Housing Secretary Steve Reed had been due to rule on the application by 21 October, but the deadline has been pushed back to 10 December.It is the second time the government has delayed a decision on the controversial site, whose location has sparked concerns it could pose an espionage risk.A ruling had originally been due by 9 September after ministers took control of the process from Tower Hamlets, the local council, last year. China bought the site of the proposed new embassy, at Royal Mint Court, near the Tower of London, for £255m in 2018. At 20,000 square metres, the proposed complex would be the biggest embassy in Europe if it goes ahead.The pending decision on whether to approve the new embassy was already under close scrutiny because of concerns about the security implications of the plan, including the location, size and design of the building.The site is close to fibre optic cables carrying communications to and from financial institutions in the City of London. Concerns have been raised that Chinese operatives could use the site to tap into the cables and eavesdrop.Further questions have been raised in recent weeks about the nature of the threat posed by Beijing, following the collapse of the case against two men accused of spying for China.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33, last month. Both men deny the allegations. The government's first delay was requested by Reed's predecessor Angela Rayner, after she asked China to explain why some rooms within its planning documents had been blanked out for \"security reasons\".Planning consultants working for the Chinese embassy had replied that China \"does not consider that, as a matter of principle, it is necessary or appropriate to provide full internal layout plans\".Rayner had written back to groups involved in the consultation, including China, the Met police and a local residents' association, to give them more time to respond to the plans and putting the deadline back to 21 October.Reed, who took over the housing role following Rayner's resignation last month, has now requested additional time before a final decision needs to be made.In a letter seen by the BBC, the housing department said more time was needed due to the \"detailed nature\" of responses received so far.It added that it was unable to set a new deadline for fresh comments until it receives pending responses from the Foreign Office and Home Office. BBC visited the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyThe proposed complex would include offices, a large basement area, housing for 200 staff, and a new tunnel to connect the Embassy House to a separate building on the embassy grounds.Beijing's application for the embassy was initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety and security concerns.It resubmitted an identical application to the council in August 2024, one month after Labour came to power. The government then took over the decision in October.The Chinese Embassy in the UK has previously said the new complex would enhance \"mutually beneficial cooperation\" between China and Britain.In a new diplomatic note released alongside Reed's letter explaining his reasons for the latest delay, a Chinese official said objections to the site were \"either ill-founded or unjustified\".The Conservatives said Labour ministers should throw out the application, and accused them of trying to \"silence the warnings about the threats to national security\" posed by the embassy site.The Liberal Democrats also called for the application to be blocked, calling on the government to \"stand up to China\".Foreign Affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said it would be \"insane\" for ministers to allow the embassy development to go ahead, after warnings from the head of MI5 on Thursday about the threat of Chinese espionage.Boris Johnson's former chief advisor Dominic Cummings said MI5 and MI6 had warned him China was \"trying to build a spy centre underneath the embassy,\" when he was working at Downing Street.Speaking on ITV's Talking Politics podcast, Cummings said the agencies had told him that allowing the embassy to be built would be \"an extremely bad idea\". In his annual speech, Sir Ken McCallum said \"Chinese state actors\" presented a national security threat to the UK \"every day\".He added that the UK needed to \"defend itself resolutely\" against China, while also being able to \"seize the opportunities\" from having a relationship with Beijing.

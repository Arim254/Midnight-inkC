    "body": "52 minutes agoPA MediaA total of 91 prisoners were freed by mistake between April and October this year, according to new government figures.The data for England and Wales was published by the government ahead of a statement in Parliament on the issue by Justice Secretary David Lammy.The government is under pressure over accidental releases, after a number of high-profile cases in recent weeks.The Conservatives had called for Labour ministers to reveal the latest figures, saying the public \"deserve to know the truth about the scale of the security crisis in our prisons\".The number of accidental releases has been increasing in recent years.A total of 262 prisoners in England and Wales were freed by mistake in the 12 months to March, according to the latest annual figures, up 128% from 115 the previous year.The latest data released by the Ministry of Justice covers a seven-month period between 1 April and 31 October.The department said the figures cover any prisoner who is released when they should have remained in custody, where the individual or a third party did not deliberately play a role in the error.It said the data was not directly comparable to annual figures, with the possibility of seasonal effects on releases and late recordings.The department added that figures for recent months could change over time and in the past revisions \"have tended to be upwards\". Last week it emerged that two men had separately been released by mistake from HMP Wandsworth in the space of one week. Both men are now back in custody after police manhunts.It came after migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex last month.Kebatu, who has now been deported, was living in an asylum hotel when he sexually assaulted a 14-year-old girl in Epping, triggering protests which spread across the country.

    "body": "The Princess of Wales and the Queen have joined services to mark Armistice Day in the UK as events took place around the world.Catherine stood at the ceremony at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, where the Last Post signalled the start of a national two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT to mark the end of World War One.Queen Camilla was at Paddington Station in London for the wreath-laying ceremony, having travelled by train.The Prince of Wales has also delivered a video message to young people, sharing his views on the importance of wearing a red poppy and to say that \"remembrance is for everyone\".It was the first time Catherine had attended the service at the National Memorial Arboretum.She laid a wreath in the centre of the armed forces memorial, watched by a crowd which included veterans and their families.Catherine appeared to take a moment of reflection before returning to her seat where she bowed her head as the crowd prayed for those who had been affected by conflict.The Prince of Wales' message was a virtual event for children between nine and 14 in the UK.In it he says: \"When we remember, we connect with service in a personal way.\"We learn from the courage of others, and we carry their stories forward, so they are not forgotten.\"It's not just about the past - it's about shaping who we become in the future.\"Remembrance teaches us empathy, resilience and responsibility.\"And when we wear a red poppy or take a moment of silence, we are saying, 'Thank you. We have not forgotten, and we will not forget'.\"Meanwhile, the service in Staffordshire featured the reading of a specially- commissioned poem by the arboretum's poet in residence, Arji Manuelpillai.\"A Sonnet For Us All captures the stories etched into the hundreds of memorials within the National Memorial Arboretum, it invites people to listen, reflect and consider the emotion that was the inspiration for these sculptures,\" Mr Manuelpillai said.\"These human connections, and the gentle responsibility to carry love forward, are themes that resonate not only with me, but also with HRH The Princess of Wales, for whom the importance of service and compassion lies especially close to the heart.\"Queen Camilla joined commuters on the 09:28 train from Chippenham in Wiltshire to Paddington where a service was held for service personnel and their families.Later on Tuesday, William will join the King and Queen at Windsor Castle where a reception will honour veterans who served in the Pacific during the Second World War.The event, which the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Gloucester will also attend, continues the commemorations for the 80th anniversary of VJ Day - or Victory over Japan Day.Elsewhere around the world French President Emmanuel Macron attended a wreath-laying ceremony in the Champs-Elysees in Paris to mark the signing of the armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.Meanwhile the Princess Royal is in Australia, visiting Brisbane's Galipolli Barracks where she laid a wreath.Along with her husband, Sir Timothy Laurence, Princess Anne also met current and former armed forces and their families.",

    "body": "11 hours agoEd Thomas,UK editor, Rebecca Wearn and Patrick ClahaneNational Crime AgencyMillions of illegal vapes and tobacco were seized in the month-long crackdown Targeted raids on High Street premises such as mini-marts, vape shops, barbers and takeaways have seen more than 920 people arrested, in the largest action of its kind coordinated by the National Crime Agency (NCA).More than 340 notices for illegal working and renting were issued by authorities, which could see businesses and landlords fined tens of thousands of pounds.Last week the BBC exposed Kurdish crime fixers who claimed to be able to make £60,000 illegal working fines disappear. The BBC's reporting also uncovered a Kurdish criminal network using \"ghost directors\" to represent companies' official paperwork while remaining uninvolved in day-to-day operations.Undercover journalists posing as asylum seekers were told how easy it was to take over a shop and make thousands of pounds a week from illegal tobacco.The Home Office said it would investigate the BBC's findings.The NCA led the month-long crackdown – which saw 2,734 High Street premises visited and over £10.7m criminal proceeds seized, including millions of illegal tobacco and vapes, over half a million pounds in cash and 70kg of cannabis.The illicit tobacco alone equates to more than £3.5m worth of duty evaded, the NCA estimates.Over 450 registered businesses have been referred to Companies House for further investigation.\"Thousands of officers have been deployed up and down our country, targeting criminal profits and the means of generating them,\" Rachael Herbert, director of the national economic crime centre at the NCA, said.\"Hundreds of thousands of harmful and illegal products have been taken off our streets, and over £10m in cash, frozen in bank accounts and criminal assets seized.\"National Crime AgencyIllegal vapes and tobacco were among contraband seized in a mart in PortsmouthThe NCA estimates that at least £12bn of criminal cash is generated in the UK each year, which is typically smuggled out of the country or siphoned through financial systems to be reinvested in criminal enterprise.Senior politicians have warned that a UK-wide criminal network uncovered by the BBC is acting as a pull factor for illegal migration to the UK.The BBC also understands that 25 Labour MPs have joined a campaign to \"shut down dodgy shops\" following concerns in their constituencies.The group, led by Melanie Onn, MP for Great Grimsby and Cleethorpes, is calling for new legislative powers and tougher penalties for offenders.PAOperation Machinize was launched by the NCA responding to reports of money launderingHome Office security minister Dan Jarvis said: \"Criminals are using these dodgy shops as fronts for serious organised crime, money laundering and illegal working, risking the future of the British High Street.\"We have intensified our joint efforts with law enforcement to dismantle criminal networks and relentlessly pursue those who use dirty money for personal gain.\"October was the second month-long intensification of High Street visits since March this year, under the NCA's Operation Machinize.The joint action saw every police force in the UK work with partners including Trading Standards, HM Revenue & Customs and Home Office Immigration Enforcement.The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CSTI), which represents officers working in councils across the UK, told the BBC: \"The threat of serious and organised crime on our High Streets was identified as the number one threat facing our members.\"CSTI would like officers' resources and powers to close businesses strengthened as a result.",

    "body": "35 minutes agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Dearbail JordanPakistan: Suicide attack outside Islamabad court kills 12A suicide attack outside a court in Pakistan's capital Islamabad has killed 12 people and injured at least 27 more, the country's interior minister said.Mohsin Naqvi said a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside.Naqvi said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.Jumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.Suicide blasts in Islamabad have been rare in recent years. Footage from the scene on Tuesday showed the remains of a burnt-out car and a police cordon in place.The 27 people injured are receiving medical treatment, Naqvi said.He added that the attacker detonated the bomb close to a police car after waiting for up to 15 minutes. Footage of the aftermath showed plumes of smoke rising from a charred vehicle behind a security barrier. The incident occurred at 12:39 local time (07:39 GMT).Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said he \"strongly condemned the suicide blast\". A lawyer who said he was parking his car outside the court at the time described hearing a \"loud bang\".Rustam Malik told AFP news agency \"it was complete chaos\".\"Lawyers and people were running inside the complex,\" he added. \"I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire.\"Police cordoned off an area close to a district court in Islamabad after the blastPrior to the Jumaat Ul Ahrar statement claiming responsibility, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.In a statement, he said that \"terrorist attacks on unarmed citizens of Pakistan by India's terrorist proxies are condemnable\".Delhi has not responded to the accusations. It has previously denied such claims.In a separate incident on Monday, a car exploded in India's capital Delhi, killing eight people and injuring a number of others. The Indian government has not called the incident a terror attack, although the case has been referred to the country's anti-terror body.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said following the attack: \"The conspirators behind this heinous act will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice, no matter how deep the conspiracy runs.\"There is, however, no official word yet on what led to the blast.The last time Pakistan's capital was targeted by a suicide bombing was three years ago when a police officer was killed and several others injured.There have been suicide attacks in other parts of the country in the years since but not in Islamabad.

    "body": "38 minutes agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterShutterstockVinted users have been reacting angrily after an update resulted in items being listed as the wrong size.The second-hand shopping app has revised its sizing categories for women's and children's clothes but did not contact all users about the change.Many shoppers and sellers have taken to social media saying Vinted listings now show a different size category than originally posted because of the remapping, with one TikTok user describing the conversion as a \"nightmare\".The company said in a post on its website that the new system was more in line with other platforms. It has advised users to check their listings and manually change the size if necessary, which has left users frustrated.Hannah-Abby, 35, from Devon, told BBC News she was forced to switch her account to holiday mode because she did not have time to update all her listings.\"I think the whole thing just wasn't clearly thought through,\" she said.  \"Most of my friends have also put their pages on holiday mode.\"Hannah-AbbyHannah-Abby says she probably will not buy clothes on Vinted in futureThe 35-year-old said she stopped buying clothes on Vinted recently, and will most likely not return to the platform unless the sizing categorisation reverts to the original system.She said it was \"really frustrating\" that she could not physically speak to a person at the company, which she described as being unacceptable.'More accurate'Vinted said it was changing the sizing system to make shopping on the app \"easier than ever\".The company said: \"Now, the sizes you see on these listings will be more accurate, especially for items purchased from other countries or international brands.Before the change, the sizes had both a single numeric size and a letter, for instance S/8 or M/10.The new system has a letter and a range such as S/UK 8-10.In some cases, the sizing has been recategorised - for example a size L used to be a 12 but is now a UK 16-18.There are also different numeric size ranges, for instance an XXL/16 size has been changed to XXL/UK 24-26.One X user wrote: \"Grouping the sizing like that is just stupid. It's going to make it twice as hard for buyers to find things in their size.\"Did anyone actually think this through?\"TikTok user Lisa described the update as confusing and time-consuming. She said sellers with a lot of listings needed to manually edit every item to correct the sizing, which was unnecessary while other improvements suggested by users remain unaddressed.\"This is not a good change. In fact it's [going to] be an absolute nightmare if you have to go in and change all of your listings that you've already got.\"BBC/Alys DaviesVinted has revised its sizing categories for women's and children's clothesFrankie Bridger, who makes TikTok content about plus-size fashion, said the change \"makes both selling and buying harder\".\"Not many brands say XL is a 20-22,\" which is what Vinted now does, Frankie said.\"People have been asking Vinted for years to make the sizing separate, [with] one tag for letters and one for numbers.\"A Vinted spokesperson told BBC News: \"We've updated our size guidelines for women's and kids' clothing to make sizing more accurate across international brands. \"UK members will have received a message in their Vinted inbox with more details and you can also find full information on our help centre.\"Frankie BridgerFrankie said the change will make both buying and selling on Vinted harderStephanie Gallen, from Glasgow, said garments she listed on Vinted with size 14 labels were appearing on the platform as size 20–22.She told BBC News she contacted the firm to clarify whether this was an error but is yet to receive a response.\"If anyone [who is] size 20-22 buys them they're going to be very disappointed,\" she said.Charlotte Lunn, from Derby, said she had been left angered by the change as she had to manually change the sizes on \"every single listing\".\"For me this is particularly frustrating, as I'm chronically ill and selling on Vinted has been paramount for me since losing part of my income,\" she said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemEPAFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir handed out sweets after the bill's first reading was approvedIsrael's parliament has passed the first reading of a bill proposing the death penalty for those it deems to be terrorists acting against the state - a requirement which means it is likely to be used only against Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks on Israelis.The far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir - whose Jewish Power party brought the vote - celebrated late on Monday by handing out sweets after the bill was approved in the 120-seat Knesset by 39 votes to 16.\"After the law is finally passed - terrorists will only be released to hell,\" he said. The bill must pass two more readings before becoming law.In the same session, the Knesset also approved the first reading of another controversial bill allowing the Israeli government to close a foreign media outlet without court approval. That vote was 50 in favour and 41 against.The legislation aims to turn a temporary order that allowed the closure of Qatari-owned Al Jazeera in May 2024, into a permanent law. It has been opposed by the government's legal advisers.While the death penalty does exist for a small number of crimes in Israel it has only been used twice since 1948 when the state was created. The last time was when the Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, was hanged in 1962, after a public trial.An amendment to the penal code was demanded by the Jewish Power party and signed off by the Knesset's National Security Committee, which said in a statement that its purpose was to \"nip terrorism in the bud and create a weighty deterrent\".The statement read: \"It is proposed that a terrorist convicted of murder motivated by racism or hatred towards the public, and under circumstances where the act was committed with the intent to harm the State of Israel and the rebirth of the Jewish nation in its homeland will be sentenced to the death penalty - mandatory.\"The clause about harming Israel makes it likely that Palestinians convicted of deadly attacks, but not Jewish Israelis, will be sentenced to death.The foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the occupied West Bank - called the proposed law a \"new form of escalating Israeli extremism and criminality against the Palestinian people\".ReutersIsrael released almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza a month ago in exchange for 20 living Israeli hostages held by HamasBen-Gvir had long pushed for the death penalty bill to be brought to a Knesset vote, but such a move was previously opposed by Israeli political and security leaders who argued it could complicate efforts to free living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.That is no longer a concern since their return after the start of the Gaza ceasefire last month.Ben-Gvir was one of just a few Israeli ministers who voted against the Gaza ceasefire deal which aimed to end the war. This saw 20 living hostages sent home in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including about 250 serving life sentences, many convicted of killing Israelis.\"A dead terrorist does not get released alive,\" commented Limor Son Har-Melech, a member of Jewish Power, and sponsor of the bill.In 2003, during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, a then-pregnant Har-Melech and her husband - who lived in a settlement in the occupied West Bank - were attacked by Palestinian gunmen while in their car. Her husband was killed and she was injured, leading her to give birth by an emergency caesarean section.She told the Knesset one of her husband's killers went on to be released in a previous exchange deal to bring home an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza. She said he went on to command a deadly attack on another Israeli and take part in the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023, before he was killed during the Gaza war.Responding to the draft bill, Palestinian human rights organisations said its \"most alarming aspect\" would be that if it became law, it could be used to apply retroactively.They suggested its intent was \"executing collective death sentences that could target hundreds of Palestinian detainees from the Al-Qassam Brigades' elite forces who were arrested on or after 7 October\", referring to Hamas's military wing.Israel's justice minister has already said he is seeking Knesset legislation to set up a special criminal tribunal to try Gazans accused of involvement in the attacks of 7 October 2023, in a process that could result in death sentences being handed down to those convicted.Some 1,200 people were killed two years ago in the cross-border attack on southern Israel by several thousand armed Hamas fighters. In the war that it triggered, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 69,000 people were killed in Gaza.ReutersIsraeli troops raided and shut down Al Jazeera's offices in Ramallah in September 2024The push by Israeli lawmakers to formalise what has become known as the \"Al Jazeera Law\" also follows on from the Gaza ceasefire.During the war, a ban imposed by Israel's ministry of communications forced Al Jazeera to close its office at a hotel in occupied East Jerusalem. The Israeli military then ordered the closure of the network's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, claiming it was a threat to national security.Israel accused Al Jazeera of anti-Israel bias and of supporting Hamas in its news coverage. Al Jazeera has repeatedly denied such accusations and condemned Israel's actions.The new international media legislation would give the government permanent powers to stop foreign broadcasters in Israel, even outside times of war or national emergency and would remove the need for judicial oversight.Last year, when petitioning the High Court of Justice against the temporary order allowing sanctions on foreign broadcasters, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) argued that \"the law violates freedom of expression, the right to information and freedom of the press, and blocks citizens and residents from receiving a variety of information that does not fit the Israeli narrative or is not broadcast on Israeli media channels.\"The two controversial bills are expected to be prepared for second and third parliamentary readings.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLewis AdamsEssexPA MediaThe Bell Hotel was the focal point of intense protests and counter-protests over the summerAsylum seekers can continue living at an Essex hotel after a council lost a landmark legal battle at the High Court to remove them.Epping Forest District Council sought to block migrants lodging at The Bell Hotel in Epping by arguing its owner had flouted planning rules.Mr Justice Mould dismissed the claim on Tuesday, ruling an injunction was \"not an appropriate means of enforcing planning control\".A wave of protests were staged outside the hotel in the summer, following the arrest of an asylum seeker living there who was later jailed for sexual offences.The judge said he accepted \"the criminal behaviour of a small number of individual asylum seekers\" housed at the hotel had \"raised the fear of crime\" among locals.But he rejected the idea that hotel owner Somani Hotels had shown a \"flagrant or persistent abuse of planning control\".It was also said there was a \"continuing need\" to house asylum seekers with pending asylum claims, \"so that the Home Secretary can fulfil her statutory duties\".A judge previously awarded the council a temporary injunction in August, but this was later overturned at the Court of Appeal after the Home Office stepped in.Its lawyers told the court that if Epping Forest District Council was granted an injunction to stop the 138 asylum seekers living there, it could encourage other local authorities to seek similar outcomes.Tuesday's ruling then superseded this and became a final decision on the hotel's operation.Reacting to it, the Conservatives said the court had given a \"slap in the face to the people of Epping\".Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"The people of Epping have been silenced in their own town.\"Ken Williamson, a cabinet member on Epping Forest District Council, said the authority had been \"outgunned by bigger and more powerful interests\".\"What we saw in court was an unholy alliance of lawyers for government and big business intent on protecting huge profits and an indefensible asylum policy,\" he added.But a Home Office spokesman said the judgement allowed it to continue its work to close every asylum hotel in an \"orderly, planned and sustained programme\". Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, added the government needed to take a different approach towards ensuring all hotels were closed next year and described plans to house people in military sites as \"unsuitable, isolating\" and \"expensive\".PA MediaProtests and counter-demonstrations have been staged outside The Bell Hotel during the summerHadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian national who arrived in the UK on a small boat and was convicted of sex offences while living at the Epping hotel, was jailed for a year in September.He had been released in error from prison and re-detained after a three-day manhunt - before his deportation in October.Some of the protests outside The Bell Hotel following Kebatu's arrest turned violent - and three men were jailed in October for punching, kicking and pushing police officers.Mr Justice Mould said earlier: \"The claimant's desire to find a swift resolution to the disruption to public order and the community tensions which followed the outbreak of street protests on 11 July 2025 was reasonable.\"It does not however follow that the solution lay in an application for an injunction.\"Philip Coppel KC, for the council, previously accused Somani Hotels of \"sidestepping\" planning laws when turning The Bell Hotel into asylum seeker accommodation.He said the company was driven by \"the lure of a trove of government-funded profits\".PA MediaThe hotel has been housing asylum seekers in spells since May 2020However, Home Office lawyer James Strachan KC told one of the hearings that block-booking rooms at The Bell Hotel \"does not change its use as a hotel\".He argued that it was not in the public interest to grant an injunction, when considering \"the backdrop of multiple other local authorities seeking similar\" rulings.The hotel has been housing asylum seekers in spells since May 2020, a service Somani Hotels claimed had been a financial lifeline.It applied for planning permission for a \"temporary change of use\" in February 2023, but the High Court was previously told this was withdrawn after it had not been determined by April 2024.Jenny Wigley KC, for Somani Hotels, told the hearing in October that there had been \"no breach\" of planning laws and described the council's decision-making process on this as \"seriously flawed\".More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "33 minutes agoTony HanGlobal China UnitMetropolitan PoliceQian Zhimin enjoyed a lavish lifestyle of travel and shopping before UK police discovered her stash of crypto A woman, said by police to have bought cryptocurrency now worth billions of pounds using funds stolen from thousands of Chinese pensioners, has been sentenced to 11 years and eight months for money laundering.Passing sentence at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, Judge Sally-Ann Hales  told Qian Zhimin she was \"the architect of this offending from its inception to its conclusion... your motive was one of pure greed\".After fleeing China, Qian moved to a mansion in Hampstead, north London. The Metropolitan Police raided it a year later and made one of the world's single largest crypto seizures.More than 100,000 Chinese people invested their money in her company - which claimed to be developing high-tech health products and mining cryptocurrency. In reality, she embezzled the funds, police say. Investors have told the BBC World Service they hope to get at least some of their cash back from the UK authorities. Anything left unclaimed would normally default to the UK government - leading some to speculate that the Treasury could stand to gain from the haul.\"If we can gather all the evidence together, we hope the UK government, the Crown Prosecution Service and the High Court can show compassion,\" said one victim we are calling Mr Yu, who says his marriage failed as a result of the fraud. \"Because now, it's only that haul of Bitcoin [cryptocurrency] that can return us a little bit of what we lost.\"Qian Zhimin, 47, arrived in the UK under a fake passport in September 2017, after Chinese police started investigating her. She moved into a mansion on the edge of Hampstead Heath, at a rent of more than £17,000 ($22,700) a month. To pay for this, she needed to convert her Bitcoin stash back into money she could spend.So she posed as a wealthy antiques and diamond heiress, and hired a former takeaway worker as her personal assistant, who she asked to trade the cryptocurrency into other assets, such as cash and property.Metropolitan PoliceOn fleeing China, Qian rented this house in Hampstead As Bitcoin rocketed in value, Qian could achieve what her company promised its investors - that they could \"get rich while lying down\". Her assistant Wen Jian - at her own trial last year, which culminated in a six-year jail term for money laundering - said Qian had spent most of her days lying in bed, gaming and online shopping.But Qian was also drawing up a bold six-year plan for future schemes, according to her diary. Her notes outline plans to found an international bank, buy a Swedish castle, and even to ingratiate herself with a British duke.Her grander stated objective was to become queen of Liberland, an unrecognised microstate on the Croatian-Serbian border, by 2022.In the meantime, Qian had Wen look for houses she could buy in London. But her attempts to purchase an especially large property in Totteridge Common - an area known for its substantial, secluded residences - triggered a police investigation when Wen was unable to account for her boss's wealth.Attempts by Qian to buy this property in Totteridge sparked a police investigation Police raided Qian's Hampstead rental property and uncovered hard drives and laptops found to be loaded with tens of thousands of Bitcoin - believed to be the single largest cryptocurrency seizure in UK history.Qian had set up the company through which money was embezzled just four years earlier, in her native China. Lantian Gerui, or Bluesky Greet in English, claimed to use investors' money to mine - or generate - new Bitcoin, and to invest in a range of pioneering technological devices.But UK police believe this was an elaborate scam, and that Qian's company was simply using promises of high profits to pull more and more investors into the scheme.\"The more information we got about her involvement… that she was actually the leader of the fraud, not just a lower down member… it became obvious that yes she's very clever, she's very switched on, very manipulative, able to persuade a lot of people,\" Det Con Joe Ryan from the Met told the BBC.One of her investors, Mr Yu, says he never suspected anything was wrong because the company drip-fed him a portion of his apparent earnings - just over 100 yuan ($14, £10) - every day.\"That made everyone feel really good, it even gave us the confidence to borrow a little more to invest in the company,\" he says.He and his wife had initially invested 60,000 yuan ($8,429, £6,295) each. They were told, he says, they would make a 200% profit over two and a half years. They were soon taking out thousands of pounds' worth of loans at interest rates of up to 8%, in order to invest more.In addition, Mr Yu reinvested his daily payouts back into the company as soon as he received them.\"There was no rule that you had to reinvest your earnings, but I suppose we were just too weak to resist. They just pumped up our dreams… until we lost all self-control, all critical judgment.\"Chinese social mediaQian Zhimin's company staged huge meetings and banquets for current and prospective investors in China Investors saw their daily payouts topped up for each new person they signed up. This helped the scam reach some 120,000 people, based in every one of China's provinces, according to documents from trials in China of the company's official promoters. Their deposits totalled more than 40bn yuan ($5.6bn, £4.2bn), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has found.A former company employee later testified that it was new investors' money that had been funding the daily payouts, not crypto-mining dividends.Lantian Gerui's marketing exploited the loneliness of many middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Qian wrote poems about social responsibility, with lines such as: \"We must love the elderly with the infatuation of a first romance.\" The company also organised mass holidays and banquets for current and potential investors. These were used to promote yet more investment opportunities - slideshows and card machines at the ready.Lantian Gerui also trumpeted its love of China as a nation, another ploy calculated to appeal to the elderly.\"Our patriotism was our Achilles' heel, that's what they exploited,\" says Mr Yu, who is in his 60s. \"They said that they wanted to make China number one in the world.\"A range of speakers endorsed the company, including the son-in-law of the late Chairman Mao, the founding father of the People's Republic of China - Mr Yu said.\"We in our generation all looked up to Chairman Mao, so if even his son-in-law was vouching for it, how could we not trust it?\"Watch our film on YouTube The company even held an event in the Great Hall of the People, where China's legislature meets, according to an investor who attended the event and two others we spoke to.\"That bunch of [promoters], they'd take something red and persuade you it was white, take something black and convince you it was red,\" Mr Yu says.Despite leading this high-profile enterprise, Qian was notoriously secretive, known only as Huahua or Little Flower to her clients, and communicating with them largely through the poems she posted on her blog.But she would emerge for the biggest investors - those who put in at least 6m yuan ($842,000, £628,000) - inviting them to more intimate events, according to one of these clients, Mr Li.\"Those of us present, you could say that we were starstruck,\" he remembers. \"We all saw her as our Goddess of Wealth.\"She started encouraging us to dream big… that within three years, she'd give us enough wealth to last our families three generations.\"Mr Li, his wife, and his brother, invested some 10m yuan ($1.3m, £1m) between them.AlamyQian was aiming to become queen of Liberland  - 7 sq km of uninhabited marshland on a western bank of the River Danube A Chinese police investigation into Lantian Gerui, launched in mid-2017, signalled the beginning of the end for Qian's scheme.\"The payouts suddenly stopped,\" Mr Yu recalls. \"The company said the police were doing some checks… though we were promised that payments would resume soon enough.\"What helped the investors initially keep calm, he says, was company managers' reassurance that this was just a temporary blip, urging them not to approach the police.What he later discovered through the Chinese court cases, he says, is that Qian had paid off those senior managers to assuage investors' concerns - while she fled to the UK with the money.Qian was not entirely oblivious to the plight of her investors - she outlined a plan in her diary to pay back her debts in China, once the price of Bitcoin had reached £50,000 per coin. But her diary makes clear that her priority was to rule and develop Liberland, earmarking millions of pounds for this project.When she was finally arrested in York, in the north of England, last April, police also found four other people at the house, Southwark Crown Court heard at the start of her sentencing hearing on Monday. All four had been brought to the UK specifically to work for Qian in roles such as shopping, cleaning and security - and were employed illegally, the court was told.At the time of her arrest, Qian denied all charges, claiming she was simply fleeing a Chinese government crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs, and disputing evidence presented by the Chinese police. But then, at her trial in September, she unexpectedly pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency.Qian's lawyer issued a statement after her sentencing on Tuesday which described her client as a \"Bitcoin pioneer\", adding that Qian accepted her conviction but that she \"never set out to commit fraud but recognises her investment schemes were fraudulent and misled those who trusted her\".Watch the moment police raided a house in York to arrest QianBefore her jail term was announced, Mr Li told the BBC Qian's guilty plea offered victims a \"glimpse of sunlight\".The cryptocurrency Qian brought to the UK has multiplied more than 20 times in value since her arrival. Its fate will be decided by a civil \"proceeds of crime\" case that will start in earnest early next year.There are thousands of Chinese investors planning to make a claim in this case, say lawyers from two firms representing victims. But this will not be easy, one of them - a Chinese lawyer who asked to remain anonymous - told us. They will need to prove their claim - and in many cases they did not transfer money to Qian's company directly, but to accounts of local promoters who then passed the cash up the chain. It is not clear whether the victims, if successful, will receive only their original investment, or an inflated amount which reflects Bitcoin's subsequent rise in value.As in other \"proceeds of crime\" cases, any money left over after this process would normally default to the UK government. The BBC asked the UK Treasury what it plans to do with any remaining money, but it did not respond.Separately, last month, the CPS said it was considering a compensation scheme for those with no representation in the civil case. We asked the CPS what level of evidence this alternative scheme would require, but it told us it was not able to share any details at this stage.The toll on Mr Yu - whose wife invested alongside him - has not just been financial, but personal, culminating in divorce and little contact with his son, he told the BBC.Still, he considers himself relatively lucky. One lawyer we spoke to said many of Qian's investors were left without money for food or medicine.Mr Yu knew one such person - from Tianjin, northern China. She died of breast cancer after discharging herself from hospital, unable to afford treatment, he said.\"She was at death's door, and she knew I could write, so she asked me to write her an elegy if the worst came to the worst.\"Mr Yu says he kept his word and wrote a poem in her memory which he posted online. It ends with the lines:\"Let us be pillars, holding up the sky / Rather than sheep, to be led and misled / To those who  survive - strive harder / That we might right this grave injustice.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoAndrew PickenA look at Edinburgh's Radical Road which has been closed since 2018 It offers one of the iconic views of Edinburgh that has been celebrated in books and paintings for centuries.But access to the city's Radical Road path -  set high along cliffs at Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks - has been blocked since 2018.This was when 50 tonnes of rock fell from the cliffs, known as the Salisbury Crags, on to the path.The Radical Road was fenced off and years of rancour and indecision about reopening it have followed. Stretching for less than a mile in length, the Radical Road packs a lot in when it comes to rich history and stunning views of Scotland's capital. It overlooks the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where senior royals stay when they visit Edinburgh.The path got its name from the unemployed west of Scotland weavers who were set to work paving a track around Salisbury Crags - a plan suggested by author Sir Walter Scott in the aftermath of the Radical War of 1820.It also contains the location where the founder of modern geology James Hutton arrived at his theory of how and when the world was formed.Why is the Radical Road closed?HESSome of the 50 tonnes of rock which fell from Salisbury Crags in 2018Rockfalls on a narrow rocky path that clings to the side of a giant slab of dolerite rock are, unsurprisingly, not a new issue.The Radical Road has been regularly temporarily closed after significant volumes of rockfall over the last century, including a 100-tonne fall in 2011.The path was temporarily shut on five occasions in the two years before the 50-tonne fall in late 2018 sparked the current closure. At the time, park operator Historic Environment Scotland (HES) did not have an established policy on categorising what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable.This was produced six years later and shows that three section of the Radical Road - the ones where it is at its narrowest below Salisbury Crags - currently present an unacceptable risk to the public. Why Edinburgh's best view has been hidden for seven yearsThe section with the highest and intolerable risk has an estimated probability of a fatality from a rockfall event of one in 4,886. This compares with one in 95,435 for the section with a tolerable risk, where the rockface is set much further back from the path. Fairhurst, an engineering firm used by HES, also argues that its work elsewhere in the park has led it to conclude the \"number of actual rockfalls is higher than the number that is identified and reported in all areas \".What has been the impact of the closure? HES bills Holyrood Park as the \"most important open public space in the city\" so closing one of its most popular paths has had a big impact.The Radical Road itself has become overgrown without usage for years but HES says the wider path network is now \"highly degraded\" from the pressure of user numbers outweighing the capacity of the paths.Closures due to rockfalls elsewhere in the park, as well as wildfires, have not helped. HES does not have an up-to-date handle on how many people are using the park but an estimate from 2016 suggests more than two million visits a year.The 14 rangers who help manage the park are busier than ever.They dealt with 314 incidents, such as missing persons or fires, in 2023 - up from 162 incidents in 2018.HESFences and warning signs greet visitors to the start of the Radical Road path At points the overgrowth nearly stretches across the whole pathWhat needs to happen to reopen the Radical Road?Engineering firm Fairhurst first presented HES with options for long-term rockfall mitigation in 2019.It was asked to revise them in February last year to reflect the new rankings of what levels of rockfall risk would be considered acceptable.This report shows that to reopen the Radical Road the majority of the 0.8 miles (1.3km) route will need some form of engineered rockfall fence and netting.This would be similar to the measures in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle. Getty ImagesSteel netting has been in place on the rockface below Edinburgh Castle for years due to the risk of rockfallOther wider sections of the Radical Road would have a sloped earth embankment built to catch any rockfall.Fairhurst suggest this earth bund would need a fence on top to stop people getting in to the rock trap area.The firm's 2024 report estimates all of these remediation measures could cost up to £2.4m.Ranger-led guided walks in some sections of the Radical Road are available but a bigger step in the right direction for campaigners will come next year with a planned partial reopening.The areas marked in red are considered to present an unacceptable risk to the public of a fatality from rockfallUnder the plan, the path between an area called The Hawse to the northern end of South Quarry would be open again.This will allow full access to the areas where James Hutton pioneered his theory that the Earth's age could be calculated using observations of volcanic rock.Edinburgh-based geologist Angus Miller, said: \"It's great that we are going to get access to the most geologically important features of the Radical Road but it has taken far too long.\"I don't think there has been an appreciation of what the route means to people and the impact of its closure on the wider park.\"Ramblers Scotland director Brendan Paddy said: \"After years of dithering, delay and broken promises, HES bosses must now stop kicking the can down the road.\"They must publish clear plans showing how they will reopen the 200-year-old Radical Road and boost the wider Holyrood Park path network - then urgently crack on with delivering trails worthy of this world-famous heritage site.\"GettyThe dolerite rock of Salisbury Crags was quarried for use as cobble stones until it was outlawed in the 19th CenturyMaking any changes in Holyrood Park is complicated as it is regulated by its own law and protected by three further pieces of conservation legislation. Operator HES says wildfires and rockfalls elsewhere in the park over the last year meant its \"limited resources\" had to be temporarily diverted from the Radical Road but progress was still being made.A spokeswoman said: \"Work has taken place throughout 2025 as part of our commitment to reopen part of the Radical Road next year. \"This includes inspection and descaling works, vital rock trajectory modelling and analysis, and necessary ecological surveys.\"",

    "body": "Nearly all NHS trusts failing to hit cancer target11 hours agoChloe Hayward, Nick Triggle & Daniel WainwrightBBC NewsBBCJust three trusts out of 121 in England are treating cancer patients quickly enoughAlmost every hospital trust in England is failing to meet the key NHS waiting time target for cancer care, BBC analysis shows.Just three trusts out of 121 in England are treating cancer patients quickly enough - within 62 days - with experts warning delays could be putting lives at risk.The government accepted waits were too long, but said it was investing in the NHS to improve performance.Research shows getting treatment quickly is crucial, with every four-week delay reducing patient survival by an average of 10%.Dr Timothy Hanna, a leading global expert on cancer who led that research, said the BBC findings were \"worrying\".\"It's not a few outliers. It's the norm for trusts in England to not hit these waiting time targets and they are set for a reason - timely treatment can improve survival rates.\"Paul, who has stage three colon cancer, is one of many patients who has faced delays. His first biopsy was taken in January 2024 when cancer was suspected.He did not receive any further contact from his cancer services, despite his best efforts, until January this year. He eventually had surgery on his colon in February.“The waiting was horrendous and now I think that if I had been treated properly and not had to wait so long it wouldn't have progressed to stage three,” Paul said.He is due to have further surgery next year.Why hospitals are strugglingHospitals say demand for testing and care is outstripping capacity.The BBC has also been told about when things go wrong, including scanning and radiotherapy machines breaking down, GP referral letters being lost and staffing issues - which means appointments are cancelled at the last minute.BBC Verify looked at performance across every major cancer service in England over the past 12 months – from September 2024 to August 2025.There are targets for each part of the cancer journey. Hospitals should:diagnose or rule out cancer in 75% of cases within 28 days of urgent referralbegin treatment in 96% of cases within another 31 daysensure the whole journey takes no longer than 62 days in 85% of casesNearly one in four trusts have been missing all three targets over the past 12 months.Some of the major regional cancer hubs say they are struggling with inherited waits. Larger hospitals that offer specialist services often get complex patients passed on to them from smaller hospitals.'We can't deliver care we want'One service that is struggling with inherited waits is London's Royal Free NHS Trust, which is ranked 109 out of 121 for 62-day waits - although, like so many low ranking trusts, the performance is improving. It acts as a specialist kidney cancer centre for patients across south-east England. And while it has some new equipment, including robotic surgery theatres, administration problems can result in operations being cancelled. The day before the BBC filmed a report at the hospital, the theatre sat empty as a patient had not received the letter confirming surgery.Radiotherapy is another area the Royal Free wants to improve. One of its two machines is more than 10 years old - the age at which they should be retired because they become less efficient and less reliable.Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, says old equipment is an issue.Claire Hartill, head of radiotherapy at the Royal Free, said: \"We can't deliver the service we want to and it can cause delays to patient treatment.\"We need a newer machine – it delivers better treatment faster so means we can treat more people per hour.\"The trust submitted a business plan to the government earlier this year for funding to buy a new machine, but was turned down.How best-performers are doing itThere are just three cancer services that are achieving the 62-day target over the past 12 months - Calderdale and Huddersfield, East and North Hertfordshire and Bolton NHS trusts.Streamlined communication, state-of-the-art equipment and joined-up team work appear to be key.Paul, who is in his 50s, was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, part of East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust.On the day he was told his diagnosis he also met with a surgeon and an oncologist to discuss his treatment options.His treatment choice was between a long course of radiotherapy or to have the prostate surgically removed.Once he had made up his mind to have an operation, it was booked in. His procedure will be done using robotic surgery. It not only reduces side effects, but also helps speed up recovery. Paul will only be in hospital for one night so the bed he uses will be free for another patient after only 24 hours.Paul has decided to have his prostate surgically removed \"He [the surgeon] got his diary out, flicked through a couple of pages and gave me a date. I said, that's a Saturday. The surgeon said, yes, I work Saturdays,\" laughs Paul.Over in the chemotherapy ward there are more steps being taken to ease capacity issues. A new initiative - one of the first in England - is allowing patients on certain types of chemotherapy to be taught how to do the treatment for themselves at home.Josephine Hoskins is one of them. She has to have chemotherapy injections every three weeks and lives between London and Devon. \"It's revolutionised things for me,\" she said.Moving patients like Josephine to 'at-home chemo' immediately opens up another slot for someone that needs more complex treatment.'Determined to improve'The government said it was determined to improve waiting times. A new cancer strategy is expected to be published by the government early next year. It comes after cancer was named as a ‘core priority’ in the 10-year NHS plan published in July.A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"Cancer care is a priority as we turn around more than a decade of neglect of our NHS.\"We're working at pace to ensure patients get timely diagnoses and treatment -  building more community diagnostic centres, offering evening and weekend appointments and spending £70 million on new radiotherapy machines to get patients faster access to the tests, checks and scans they require.\"But Sarah Scobie of the Nuffield Trust health think tank believes ministers will struggle to address the problems highlighted by the BBC analysis.\"The reality for the government is that it will be incredibly challenging to make meaningful progress on waiting times when finances are so tight.\"About the dataBBC News analysed official cancer waiting time statistics from NHS England, covering the 12 months from September 2024 to August 2025.The NHS publishes data monthly, but we have analysed the performance over the whole year.We looked at performance by acute trusts against the three national targets. Non-cancer specialists such as eye or orthopaedic hospitals were excluded.Trusts were ranked according to their performance on the 62-day measure, which covers the entire waiting time between urgent referral and starting treatment.Additional reporting by Jess Carr and Muskeen Liddar",

The Einstein-Freud LettersAvailable for over a yearIn 1932 the world-famous physicist Albert Einstein wrote a public letter to the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. Einstein, a keen advocate of the League of Nations and peace campaigner, asked Freud if he thought war and aggression was forever tied to human psychology and the course of international relations: could we ever secure a lasting world peace? \nEinstein’s letter is deeply prescient, as is Freud’s extraordinary response. The exchange was titled ‘Why War?’. The two thinkers explore the nature of war and peace in politics and in all human life; they think about human nature, the history of warfare and human aggression and the hope represented by the foundation of the League of Nations (precursor to the UN) and its promise of global security and a new architecture of international law. \nAt the time of their exchange, Freud is in the last great phase of his career and has already introduced psychoanalysis into the field of politics and society. Einstein, the younger of the two, is using his huge international profile as a physicist for political and pacifist intervention.\nFor Einstein, future world security means a shared moral understanding across the global order - that humankind rise above the ‘state of nature’ never to devolve into total war again. He wrote to Freud, as 'a citizen of the world…immune to nationalist bias...I greatly admire your passion to ascertain the truth. You have shown how the aggressive and destructive instincts are bound up in the human psyche with those of love and the lust for life. At the same time, you make manifest your devotion to the goal of liberation from the evils of war...’ Is it possible, Einstein asks Freud, to make us 'proof against the psychoses of hate and destructiveness?'. Freud's answer is fascinating and quite unexpected.  \nThe exchange of letters was sponsored by the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, an organisation promoting global security by using prominent thinkers, drawing on multiple fields of knowledge (from science to psychology, politics and law) to achieve a new language for international peace, following the lessons learned from the Great War of 1914-18. \nBut even as Einstein wrote to Freud in the summer of 1932, the Nazi party became the largest political party in the German Reichstag. Both men felt a sense of apprehension about what was coming; both were pacifist, both Jewish, both would be driven into exile (both Einsteinian physics and Freudian psychoanalysis were denounced by the new regime). The letters were finally published in 1933 when Hitler came to power, suppressed in Germany, and as a result never achieved the circulation intended for them. \nFeaturing readings from the Einstein–Freud letters and contributions from historians of warfare and psychoanalysis, war journalism and global security, this feature showcases the little-known exchange between two of the 20th century’s greatest thinkers, ‘Why War?’ – a question just as relevant in today’s world.\nContributors include historian of war and peace Margaret MacMillan, BBC chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet, defence and security expert Mark Galeotti, historian of international relations Patrick O Cohrs, author Lisa Appignanesi, who has written on Freud and the history of psychoanalysis, and Faisal Devji, historian of conflict and political violence in India and the Middle East. \nReadings are by Elliot Levey (Einstein) and Henry Goodman (Freud) \nProduced by Simon Hollis\nA Brook Lapping production for BBC Radio 4Programme Website",

    "body": "Dame Penny Mordaunt has told a court she feared \"sexual violence\" from a man accused of stalking her, and that his actions were more concerning than threats from others \"to shoot her and her family\".Edward Brandt, 61, denies stalking intending serious alarm or distress against the former MP for Portsmouth North. He sent multiple emails and phone messages to Dame Penny and also turned up at her Portsmouth office out of hours in a bid to meet her, Southampton Crown Court heard.The trial was told Mr Brandt's references to wanting a \"personal relationship\" with Dame Penny caused her to \"fear sexual violence, which is extremely alarming\".Her voice breaking with emotion, Dame Penny, 52, told the court: \"This comes after the spate of 13 emails plus voice messages, it's after he came to my office out of hours, it's after the police intervened and our letter of cease and desist.\"He wants to meet me after hours, the way he is talking about my physical appearance and so forth, it's clear that this is not a normal pattern of behaviour.\"The alleged offending occurred between 11 September 2023 and 12 May 2024.The court was told Mr Brandt, of Freshwater, Isle of Wight, was arrested on 24 March 2024 and given a conditional caution just under a month later, requiring him not to contact Dame Penny.He then left two voicemail messages for her on 6 and 11 May, the jury heard. One email from Mr Brandt, who said he was on the \"left wing of the Conservative Party\", stated: \"I am going to go on gently knocking at your door in order to shake your hand, I am not giving up.\"Dame Penny, who was an MP from 2010 to 2024, added: \"I have been a parliamentarian for 14 years and during that time I have had to deal with all kinds of threats and issues.\"The difference between this case and even threats to shoot me and my family, they are easier to deal with because that threat is not constantly present.\"She said she believed Mr Brandt was \"a real threat to me and still is\". The court heard Mr Brandt made reference to \"wanting to shake her hand\" about 10 times in his emails, including one that described her as having a \"gold-plated and precious hand\".Dame Penny said that she had found the emails \"creepy\" but said that \"real alarm bells didn't go off until he came to my office\".Saying that he referenced her home address in one message, she added: \"I was concerned that he knew where I lived, that he didn't seem to have any boundaries and had gone to my place of work out of hours when the office was shut.\"The court heard that Dame Penny's office had to increase security, including the installation of a panic alarm.Gemma Freeman, Dame Penny's office manager, said speaking with the defendant had left her \"with a deep sense of unease\".Ms Freeman, who broke down in tears as she spoke of the impact on Dame Penny, said: \"She was much more wary, more guarded, she was anxious about going out into public spaces when she was going out to different appointments.\"The trial continues.",

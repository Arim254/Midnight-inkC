You've got to figure them out,\" one officer said.</p><p>After the BBC sent a detailed list of allegations to the Met, it suspended eight officers and one staff member, and took two more officers off front-line duties. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the behaviour outlined by Panorama was, \"disgraceful, totally unacceptable and contrary to the values and standards\" of the force.</p><p><i><b>Warning: This story contains repeated use of highly offensive and discriminatory language</b></i></p><p>Among the officers filmed by our undercover reporter were:</p></div><div><ul><li>Sgt Joe McIlvenny, an officer with nearly 20 years' service in the Met, who was dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegations of rape and domestic violence, after a colleague raised concerns about the decision to release the accused man on bail. He replied: \"That's what she says.\"</li><li>PC Martin Borg, who enthusiastically described how he saw another officer, Sgt Steve Stamp, stomp on a suspect's leg. PC Borg laughed when he described how he had offered to make a statement saying the suspect had tried to kick the sergeant first. It was unclear from CCTV footage if the claim was true.</li><li>PC Phil Neilson, who told our reporter in the pub that a detainee who had overstayed his visa should have \"a bullet through his head\" and \"ones that shag, rape women, you'd do the cock and let them bleed out\".</li></ul></div><p>BBC Panorama's undercover reporter, Rory Bibb, spent seven months up to January this year as a designated detention officer (DDO) in the custody suite of Charing Cross police station in central London. It is a civilian role which involves working closely with sergeants and constables, but not taking part in arrests.</p><p>Charing Cross has one of the Met's 22 custody suites where people are held after arrest and before they are charged or released. It is often a volatile environment where officers deal with violent people and vulnerable individuals, including young people and those with mental health issues.</p><p></p><figcaption>Off-duty, PC Phil Neilson called immigrants \"scum\"</figcaption><p></p><div><p>The station had been the focus of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-60215575\">an investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)</a>, into bullying and discrimination nearly four years ago. It found that some officers had discussed hitting their girlfriends, shared offensive and discriminatory comments and joked about rape in private group chats.</p><p>Whistleblowers told Panorama that officers with racist and misogynistic attitudes still worked at the station despite the Met's promise to root out \"rogue officers\" and \"cultural failings\".</p></div><p></p><h2>'Terrifying' misogyny</h2><p></p><div><p>Sergeants are in charge of the custody suite day-to-day and are responsible for upholding the Met's values and ethical standards.</p><p>One of them at Charing Cross was Sgt McIlvenny, who was repeatedly filmed while on duty displaying misogynistic attitudes.</p><p>He talked to colleagues in graphic terms about his sex life, telling the undercover reporter and a female colleague about a woman he said he met online: \"She fucking fills the door, almost like monstrous.\" He added that she was \"so fat she had two pussies. There's the real one and then the fat one round it.\"</p><p>He talked about how he got sexual pleasure from having his nipples played with, despite the objections of some female colleagues in earshot.</p><p>Discussing having his nipples pierced, he said: \"My pain tolerance goes up massively if I'm aroused at the same time. So, I'm going to ask them if I can have a wank...\"</p><p>As custody sergeant, Sgt McIlvenny is responsible for making decisions about whether a suspect is remanded in custody or given bail after being charged.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Sgt McIlvenny described sexual encounters to colleagues</figcaption><p></p><div><p>When a female DDO questioned a decision to release on bail a man alleged to have raped his girlfriend, she pointed out he had also been accused of kicking the pregnant woman in the stomach. Sgt McIlvenny responded: \"That's what she says.\" Panorama does not have the full details of the case.</p><p>The female DDO later told the undercover reporter about her anger at the sergeant's response. \"The way he went, 'Yeah, it's what she says.' He fucking stamped on her stomach when she was pregnant,\" she said.</p><p>\"I'd like to turn round and go, 'You wanker. You're a wanker.' But, unfortunately, I can't. He's got stripes on his shoulders.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b53a/live/1ea34310-9e00-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Rory Bibb, seen working at his desk while wearing the uniform of a designated detention officer, a navy jumper with epaulettes in royal blue.

Under her leadership, in 2016 Nottinghamshire Police became the first force to record misogyny as a hate crime.</p></div><div><p>In January this year, while the BBC's undercover reporter was working in the station, Sgt McIlvenny was told he was being investigated for inappropriate comments he had allegedly made to a woman in custody.</p><p>Custody staff told our undercover reporter that the woman was Asian and that Sgt McIlvenny had said to her that she should be in the \"massage business\". British Transport Police officers had reported him, the custody staff said.</p><p>But last month, before Panorama informed the Met of its findings, the sergeant told the BBC's reporter that he was back working in the custody suite.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Red mist'</h2><p></p><div><p>The BBC's undercover reporter repeatedly filmed officers revelling in the use of force, revealing a culture of confidence and trust that colleagues would not blow the whistle on them.</p><p>Police officers can use force, but only when it is \"proportionate and reasonable in all the circumstances\", according to their Standards of Professional Behaviour.</p><p>Over a few drinks in a nearby pub while off duty, PC Martin Borg described how a man arrested for impersonating a police officer and attempted kidnap, and who was judged to be a suicide risk, had been restrained.</p><p>PC Borg said the man had spat at officers and urinated on the door of the cell, so officers pinned him down on the floor. While he was \"kicking out\", Sgt Steve Stamp, nicknamed \"Stampy\", brought his boot down on the man's leg, the constable said.</p><p>The undercover reporter was able to examine footage from CCTV cameras in the custody suite, which showed the sergeant stamping down twice.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>PC Martin Borg described seeing a colleague stamp on a detainee</figcaption><p></p><div><p>\"This guy's fucking screamed,\" said PC Borg. \"He had a lump on his foot that looked like a fucking tumour mate, afterwards.\" Recalling that the detainee had protested that the sergeant stamped on his leg, he remembered saying: \"Yeah he fucking did, you cunt.\"</p><p>PC Borg said the sergeant had told him afterwards that the suspect had tried to kick him. \"Absolutely Sarge,\" he recalled saying. \"I'll put that in the MG11 if you like Sarge?\"</p><p>An MG11 is a witness statement. Ms Fish, the former chief constable, said if PC Borg  had put fabricated information in it, which could be shown to be false, that would be \"perverting the course of justice or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice\".</p><p>It is not clear in the CCTV footage if the man had tried to kick Sgt Stamp. The man had bare feet and four officers were restraining him at the time.</p><p>One officer described how, if suspects refuse to have their fingerprints taken, he could pull two of their fingers hard to snap the tendons. \"I love taking fingerprints by force,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4388/live/bc0908f0-9e01-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A hidden camera shot, taken slightly from below and at an angle, of an officer in police uniform, a white man with brown hair in a side-parting and a with a cleft chin, standing in front of a police van in the courtyard of Charing Cross police station, with windows of the station all around.

She claimed she received \"threats and abuse\" on social media since Reeves' remarks.</p><p>On Wednesday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1792rk7ynko\">a judge ruled</a> that PPE Medpro's gowns did not comply with government standards.</p></div><div><p>PPE Medpro was set up by a consortium led by Baroness Mone's husband, Doug Barrowman. It was awarded a government contract to supply PPE after being recommended by Baroness Mone.</p><p>However, after ordering 25 million sterile gowns from PPE Medpro, the government later launched legal action in 2022 through the High Court, claiming the gowns did not comply with the agreed contract.</p><p>PPE Medpro argued it had complied with the contract and that the gowns were sterile.</p><p>Since Wednesday's court judgement, Baroness Mone has faced cross-party calls for her to be stripped of her peerage. </p><p>She is currently on a leave of absence from the House of Lords and Reeves has said she does not want her to return. On Thursday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told BBC News that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddml7dy1ydo\">Baroness Mone should be stripped of her title</a>.</p><p>However, peerages can only be removed by an act of Parliament. </p></div><div><p>In the letter, seen by the BBC, Baroness Mone demanded Sir Keir Starmer order an  \"urgent, independent investigation into whether ministers or officials have improperly influenced the NCA [National Crime Agency], CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and civil litigation process\".</p><p>She also insisted the chancellor retract her comments.</p><p>Baroness Mone told Sir Keir: \"I feel compelled to alert you to the dangerous and inflammatory statement made by your Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves.\"</p><p>She said the word vendetta referred to \"vengeance, feud and blood feud\" and that Reeves' comments had made her and her family feel unsafe. </p><p>She also said her social media had \"gone into meltdown with threats and abuse\", adding \"we need only look at the tragedies of Jo Cox and Sir David Amess to understand the dangers of such reckless language,\" she said.</p><p>Jo Cox was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen and was killed in 2016.</p><p>Sir David Amess was the Conservative MP for Southend West when he was fatally stabbed in 2021.</p><p>Concluding her letter, Baroness Mone said: \"Prime Minister, I ask you directly: do you stand by your chancellor's assertion that the government has a vendetta against me? Or will you act decisively to end this campaign, protect my safety, and restore integrity to government?</p><p>\"Failure to take urgent action will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal remedies, including defamation, harassment, and misfeasance claims, while also taking steps to ensure my personal safety and that of my family.\"</p></div><div><p>The Cabinet Office declined to comment.</p><p>However, a Treasury source told the BBC: \"When both the Labour chancellor and Conservative leader agree with each other you've lost the argument.\"</p><p>Mone was made a Tory peer by David Cameron in 2015, but lost the whip following the revelations about the contract to supply medical gowns.</p><p>The High Court ruled PPE Medpro failed to prove whether or not its surgical gowns, which were to be used by NHS workers, had undergone a validated sterilisation process.</p><p>Following the ruling, Mrs Justice Cockerill said the £122m damages cost must be paid by 16:00 BST on 15 October.</p></div></article>",

    "body": "<div><p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has told the BBC he will not resign from his position, after a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgq06d44jyo\">Panorama investigation revealed evidence of misogyny and racism in the force. </a></p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio London, he said those circulating rumours of his resignation within the Met were \"the misogynists and racists, frankly, who want me out, because it's them who we're taking on\".</p><p>The commissioner agreed that a range of factors that show systemic issues need to be rooted out, but stopped short of calling the issues institutional.  </p><p>He highlighted that the force had improved since he started his role three years ago, but accepted there was still a \"cancer to be removed\".</p></div><div><p>Sir Mark became the force's chief after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68433319\">the murder of Sarah Everard</a> by a serving police officer; at the time he vowed to remove wrongdoers from the Met.</p><p>The commissioner described Panorama's footage, obtained by secret filming, as \"vile to watch\", calling the officers involved \"ghastly, ghastly individuals\".</p><p>In the footage, serving Met Police officers can be seen calling for immigrants to be shot, revelling in the use of force and being dismissive of rape claims.</p><p>Sir Mark said he understood Londoners would feel \"upset and angry\" over the \"toxic views\" expressed. However, he said his force has done an \"extraordinary amount\" to root out such officers since the Casey Review, ordered after the murder of Sarah Everard in 2021.</p><p>Pressed on whether he should have accepted the review's finding that the Met was institutionally racist and misogynistic, Sir Mark insisted the Met was \"part way through the biggest counter-corruption initiative policing has ever seen in this country\". </p><p>Nearly 1,500 men and women had been removed from the Met, he said, adding: \"Londoners have my word, we won't stop until it's finished.\" </p><p>When asked if he would apologise and take personal responsibility for what was uncovered in the investigation, he said he had apologised \"several times\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9j283j9pko\">in his statement</a>, adding that \"everything the Met does\" is his \"personal responsibility\".</p><p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had yet to see the BBC's footage for himself, but called it \"shocking\" based on what had been described to him.</p><p>He said he was glad Sir Mark was responding, and called on him to be \"very robust in his response.\"</p><p>Parm Sandhu, a former chief superintendent in the Met, questioned how the force would \"find the solutions\" to the issues raised in the BBC's investigation if it did not accept it had an \"institutional problem\".</p><p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday ahead of Sir Mark's interview, she said she was \"not surprised at all\" by what Panorama had found, adding that the \"behaviours are not new\".</p><p>\"They've been exposed before, they've been buried before and they've been tolerated before, and every single time there's a promise that the toxic culture will be rooted out, but it comes back every single time,\" Sandhu said.</p></div><div><p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the documentary exposed racism, islamophobia, misogyny and criminal behaviour by officers, but that Rowley had his \"full confidence\" and insisted he was the \"right person to undertake the change that we need\".</p><p>However, he also said he questioned Rowley on why it took journalists to expose this behaviour, which \"let down\" London irrespective of the commissioner's efforts.</p><p>Khan described the Metropolitan Police as an \"institutionally racist\", \"institutionally sexist\" and \"institutionally homophobic\" organisation. The commissioner has not himself used these terms to describe the force.</p><p>Zoe Billingham, who served as Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary from 2009 to 2021, told The World Tonight on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday that Sir Mark was a \"reforming\" figure, but that the revelations were \"tricky\" for him.</p><p>\"I do think the pace of change really now needs to be demonstrated to Londoners if that precious bond of trust is to be restored,\" she said.</p></div><div><p>Sir Mark told BBC Radio London that the majority of his officers were \"good people\" who cared deeply about policing London, despite the \"far too big of a minority who don't\".</p><p>He added BBC Panorama's documentary showed that progress had been made as officers who held such views were \"going underground\", and the Met would continue to \"go after them and remove them\".</p><p>Londoners \"should trust us because the vast majority of men and women are on the streets day in-day out, working desperately hard to protect them\", he said of the force.</p><p>\"They've got courage, they've got compassion, they've got determination\", he said. </p></div>",

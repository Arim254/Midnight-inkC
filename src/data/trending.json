Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "An Australian teenager has died after he was hit by a cricket ball during a practice session in Melbourne.Ben Austin, 17, was training - with a helmet but no neck guard - in cricket nets in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday when he was hit in the neck by a ball thrown using a handheld ball launcher. Emergency workers attended the scene around 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) before Ben was rushed to hospital in critical condition. He was put on life support but died on Thursday.Ben's dad Jace Austin said the family was \"utterly devastated\" by the death of \"our beautiful Ben\" while Cricket Victoria said the cricketing community across the country would be mourning the teenager's death.In a statement, Jace Austin shared details of his family's loss. \"For Tracey and I, Ben was an adored son, deeply loved brother to Cooper and Zach and a shining light in the lives of our family and friends,\" he said. \"This tragedy has taken Ben from us, but we find some comfort that he was doing something he did for so many summers - going down to the nets with mates to play cricket.\"He loved cricket and it was one of the joys of his life.\"Mr Austin said the family was also supporting Ben's teammate who was bowling in the nets when the accident happened.\"This accident has impacted two young men and our thoughts are with he and his family as well,\" he said.He also thanked the local cricketing community for their support since the accident and praised the first responders and medical staff who helped his son. Cricket Victoria chief executive officer Nick Cummins said it was an \"extremely challenging time\" for all involved.\"The ball hit him in the neck in a similar accident that Phil Hughes suffered 10 years ago,\" Mr Cummins said, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).In 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014.His death, for which a coroner ultimately found no-one was to blame, sparked improvements to safety equipment for those playing the sport.The ball that hit Ben was apparently launched by a thrower using a handheld device, commonly used to accelerate the speed of the ball and ease the strain of bowling on the shoulders.In a statement, Cummins said: \"The entire cricketing community in Victoria - and nationally - is mourning this loss and it will be something that will stay with us for a long time.\"He described Ben as a talented player, popular teammate and captain who was well- known in under-18 circles in Melbourne's south east.\"It is heartbreaking to see a young life cut so short, while Ben was doing something that he loved so much,\" Mr Cummins said. Ben played for the Ferntree Gully Cricket Club who, in a social media post, paid tribute to the youngster as someone who brought joy to many. The club also called on friends and supporters to \"put your bats out for Benny\", mirroring a similar gesture that was made for Hughes.The Waverley Park Hawks Junior Football Club, for which Ben played more than 100 games, said he was \"kind\", \"respectful\" and a \"fantastic footballer\".\"Our club and community have lost a truly great young person who was developing into a fine young adult and his loss will be felt keenly by our club for many years to come.\"",

    "body": "15 minutes agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporter, BBC NewsVirgin Trains will be able to launch rail services through the Channel Tunnel after the UK's rail regulator approved its application to share a depot with Eurostar.The decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) means Eurostar's monopoly on passenger services is set to be broken for the first time since the tunnel opened in 1994.Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.Virgin says it wants to start running services from 2030, but the ORR says several steps will need to be taken first.The ORR had said the Temple Mills depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.The regulator said a number of steps needed to be taken before new international services could run. Virgin needs to enter into a commercial agreement with Eurostar, will have to secure finance, access to track and stations, and have to get safety approvals from UK and EU authorities.But the ORR said its decision unlocked plans for around £700m of investment and could create 400 new jobs, describing it as \"a win for passengers, customer choice, and economic growth\".Martin Jones, deputy director of Access and International at the ORR, said: \"While there is still some way to go before the first new services can run, we stand ready to work with Virgin Trains as their plans develop.\"Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said: \"The ORR's decision is the right one for consumers – it's time to end this 30-year monopoly and bring some Virgin magic to the cross-Channel route.\"Several firms had wanted to start operating services between London and mainland Europe, including Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The ORR only approved Virgin's application on Thursday and rejected applications from Evolyn, Gemini and Trenitalia.Virgin said it planned to launch rail services from London St Pancras to Europe from 2030.This will include services to Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels-Midi and Amsterdam Centraal, with future plans to expand further across France, and into Germany and Switzerland.",

    "body": "44 minutes agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorGetty ImagesVirgin Media O2 is set to become the first mobile operator to offer UK customers automatic connectivity via satellite in places without mobile signal.O2 Satellite will be an optional service due to launch in the first half of 2026.The firm has not yet revealed how much it will cost, but it will be an additional fee to pay each month.O2 has partnered with Elon Musk's satellite business Starlink to offer the service.Enabled smartphones will automatically switch to satellite coverage in parts of the UK where there is no terrestrial signal available - for example in rural areas.However those who sign up for it will not be able to make phone calls via satellite to begin with.The service will only work with messaging, maps and location apps. O2 says this is because Starlink's current satellites do not support calls, although the next generation of them will. Calls made via WhatsApp, which uses data rather than phone signal, may work though - O2 intends to trial this before the service launches to the public.The satellites will effectively act like \"phone masts in the sky\", said Luke Pearce from analysts CCS Insight.\"In today's world, connectivity is no longer optional,\" he said.\"Whether it's emergency SOS in life-saving situations or keeping a software-defined vehicle online, people now expect constant access. \"Satellite is the only technology that can truly close the coverage gap across mountains, oceans and rural areas.\"Satellite battle takes offO2's move comes several months after rival Vodafone carried out a successful live video call via satellite from a mountain in Wales where there was no other signal. It claimed this was a UK-first, but it has not yet revealed any plans to roll out satellite-to-device services to customers. Vodafone's tech worked with the satellite firm AST, which currently has six satellites in orbit and aims to have up to 60 by the end of 2026.Starlink meanwhile has more than 650, and has already launched similar services with phone networks in other countries including Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and Japan.In the UK, Ofcom tweaked its regulations in September to enable satellite connectivity directly to smartphone devices.Currently it is only possible to use it to text emergency services from newer iPhone and Android handsets.But the use of low earth satellites for mobile communications has been criticised by astronomers, who say they pollute the night sky and make it more difficult to spot potential hazards such as asteroids.",

The new arrests come after two men \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen theft on Wednesday.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight.The jewels had not been recovered yet, Beccuau told French radio station RTL on Thursday.She added that DNA from one of those arrested could be linked to the crime scene. French investigators are not giving many more details away at this stage but the new suspects can be detained for four days before being charged or released.The authorities believe that the gang involved in the heist could be bigger than the four people caught on CCTV.

    "body": "Cruise operator 'failed' woman who was left on island and died, family says6 hours agoLana LamSydneySuppliedSuzanne Rees was found dead hours after her cruise boat left Lizard IslandThe daughter of a woman who was left behind by a cruise ship on a remote island and later died has accused the operator of a \"failure of care and common sense\".The body of Suzanne Rees, 80, was found by rescue workers on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef on Sunday. The day before, she had been hiking on the island with her fellow passengers but was not on the ship when it left hours later.Katherine Rees said she was \"shocked and saddened\" that the Coral Adventurer left \"without my mum\", whom she described as healthy, active, a keen gardener and bushwalker.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense,\" she said on Thursday.It's understood that Suzanne Rees, from New South Wales, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, which had left Cairns earlier this week.Passengers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise, were transported to the exclusive island for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, but broke away from the others as she needed to rest. \"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" Katherine said. \"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Katherine said she hoped a coronial inquiry would \"find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum's life\".The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating the death and would meet the ship's crew when it is due to dock in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Saturday by the ship's captain.A search party returned to the island a few hours later but efforts to find Suzanne were called off in the early hours of Sunday before a helicopter returned in the morning and found her body. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Coral Expeditions said the company was \"deeply sorry\" for the death and were offering their support to the Rees family. \"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" Mark Fifield said. The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening. This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off,\" Ms Mallinson added.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenEPARob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to latest vote projections.With about 98% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats in the 150-member parliament, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said on Thursday.Initial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.A downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost 11 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.The race was so close there were fewer than 1,200 votes between the two frontrunners as counting continued on Thursday. Three other parties were not far behind, including the conservative liberals on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.Jetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.Going into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party had won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesThe exit poll spelt bad news for Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "6 minutes agoHarry Farley,political correspondent, and Sam Francis,political reporterReutersSir Keir Starmer has dismissed calls for an investigation into Chancellor Rachel Reeves after she apologised for breaking housing rules when renting out her family home.In a letter to the prime minister, Reeves admitted she did not obtain a \"selective\" rental licence required to rent out her London home and \"sincerely\" apologised for her \"inadvertent error\". In reply, the prime minister said he was happy the \"matter can be drawn to a close\" after consulting his independent ethics adviser, who has decided not to launch an investigation.The Conservatives have called for an investigation and for Reeves to be sacked.The exchange of letters between the PM and Reeves revealed they had met on Wednesday evening to discuss the matter, which was first reported in the Daily Mail.Reeves told Sir Keir that \"regrettably\" she was not aware a licence was needed to rent out her Southwark home after moving into Downing Street last year.Reeves wrote: \"This was an inadvertent mistake. As soon as it was brought to my attention, we took immediate action and have applied for the licence.\"I sincerely apologise for this error and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.\"In his response, the prime minister said the public expected \"the highest standards\" and confirmed he had consulted with Sir Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser whose findings have previously felled two ministers.Sir Laurie had judged that further investigation was not necessary given Reeves' swift action and apology, Sir Keir said.Reeves' family home in London was put up for rent after Labour won the election in July 2024 for £3,200 a month.It is in an area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to hold a selective licence. Selective licences ensure landlords meet set standards, normally aimed at raising housing quality, fighting crime and boosting housing demand.Reeves' allies admit she should have obtained a licence, but claim she was specifically told by the estate agents at the time that they would advise if she needed one.The council's website states: \"You can be prosecuted or fined if you're a landlord or managing agent for a property that needs a licence and do not get one.\"Reeves or her letting agent now face an unlimited fine if Southwark Council takes the matter to court. The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget next month amidst speculation the government could break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.Tory leader Kemi Badenoch earlier wrote on social media that Sir Keir \"once said 'lawmakers can't be lawbreakers'\", adding: \"If, as it appears, the chancellor has broken the law, then he will have to show he has the backbone to act.\"Shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride told BBC Breakfast on Thursday that he also believed the prime minister \"needs to show some backbone\".\"We need a proper investigation into exactly what has happened,\" he said. \"This seems to be an attempt to put the whole thing to bed with a quick exchange of letters last night.\"This is a prime minister who, when he came into office, on the steps of Downing Street talked about restoring the dignity and integrity of government. \"We have seen a whole litany of these instances – Angela Rayner, Louise Haigh and others – who have fallen well short of that standard. If he is to stand by his word I think he should be concluding her position is untenable.\"Asked if it was reasonable to call for the Chancellor's resignation, Police Minister Sarah Jones replied \"no\".She told the BBC that Reeves had \"made a mistake, she didn't know she had to apply, as soon as she knew she applied, she rectified the mistake - she told the prime minister, she told the authorities in Parliament, she did everything as she should - she rectified the mistake and she's apologised for it\".The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"The chancellor is meant to be delivering growth but the only thing she appears to be growing is the government's list of scandals.\"Just weeks before the Budget, this risks seriously undermining confidence in this government and its ability to focus on the urgent tasks at hand.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump called on US military leaders to resume testing US nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he wrote on social media just before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.The US has more nuclear weapons than any other country, Trump said, with Russia second and China a \"distant third\". It has not conducted nuclear weapons testing since 1992.It comes just days after Trump denounced Russia for testing a nuclear-powered missile, which reportedly has an unlimited range.Trump's post on Wednesday night acknowledges the \"tremendous destructive power\" of nuclear weapons, but said he had \"no choice\" but to update and renovate the US arsenal during his first term in office.He also said that China's nuclear programme \"will be even within 5 years\".Trump's post did not include details of how the tests would occur, but wrote the \"process will begin immediately\". It marks an apparent reversal of a long-standing US policy. The last US nuclear weapons test was in 1992, before former Republican President George HW Bush issued a moratorium as the Cold War ended.Trump's post came just before Xi landed in South Korea for the first face-to-face meeting between the two since 2019. The post appeared as he was aboard a helicopter, Marine One, while en route to meet Xi at Gimhae International Airport.On Air Force One after the two leaders' meeting, Trump said the nuclear test sites would be determined later, but reiterated it was \"appropriate\" for the US to match other countries in testing.Russia announced over the weekend that it had successfully tested two new weapons capable of carrying nuclear warheads.These included a missile which the Kremlin said could penetrate US defence systems, and an underwater drone called Poseidon, capable of hitting the American west coast and triggering radioactive ocean swells.However, those tests did not involve the detonation of nuclear weapons.According to US think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), China has roughly doubled its nuclear arsenal in the past five years and is expected to exceed 1,000 weapons by 2030.The US's own nuclear stockpile sits at around 5,225 warheads, while Russia has approximately 5,580, the Arms Control Association reported.Trump's statement also comes around 100 days before the expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New Start) in February 2026 - the last remaining nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia.The agreement limits each country to 1,550 warheads on deployed missiles capable of crossing continents.The last time the US tested a nuclear bomb was 23 September 1992. The test took place at an underground facility in the western state of Nevada.The project, code named Divider,  was the 1,054th nuclear weapons test conducted by the US, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which played a central role in helping develop the world's first atomic bomb.The Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105km) north of Las Vegas, is still operated by the US government.\"If deemed necessary, the site could be authorized again for nuclear weapons testing,\" according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, which is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.The US first marched into the nuclear era with the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb in July 1945 in the desert at Alamogordo, New Mexico.It later became the only country in the world to use nuclear weapons in warfare after dropping two atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in August of the same year during World War Two.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorReutersRob Jetten became one of the youngest ministers in Dutch history under former PM Mark RutteRob Jetten's achievement in dragging his socially liberal D66 party from fifth place to the top of Dutch politics in less than two years has been extraordinary. But politically, all the stars were perfectly aligned for the 38-year-old to do so.The result of Wednesday's election is too close to call, with Jetten vying with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders for the most seats in parliament.No other political leader commanded as much screen time during the campaign as Jetten and his smile and cheerful message resonated with voters, while his rivals sometimes struggled.Hardly a night went by without him on TV. When Wilders cancelled an appearance because of security fears, Rob Jetten seized the moment and took his place. He even featured in a TV quiz show recorded months ago called The Smartest Person.And his D66 party was untarnished by involvement in Wilders' ill-fated 11-month coalition, largely because Jetten had fared so poorly in the last election in 2023. The government collapsed last June when Wilders' party quit following a row over migration.But perhaps more than anything else, he was able to convey a positive message summed up by the slogan Het kan wel - an optimistic phrase that borrows from Barack Obama's \"Yes, we can\".It contrasted strongly with Wilders, who he accused of \"sowing division\".If his party does come top, Rob Jetten could become the Netherlands' first openly gay prime minister.A self-confessed politics nerd as a child, the young Jetten grew up in a small town in the southern province of Brabant and came out when he was young.Jetten has not made his private life part of his political identity, but five years ago he posted a video in which he read out a long list of homophobic messages from his phone, to prove why an international day against homophobia was important.Jetten is now engaged to Argentine hockey player, Nicolás Keenan, and they are due to marry next year.EPAJetten led a highly polished campaign and outperformed rivals in TV debatesHe was an early supporter of the centrist D66, which describes itself as progressive and socially liberal party, and officials soon spotted his potential.After a few years working for Dutch rail network ProRail, Jetten was elected as an MP in 2017 and had a couple of early experiences as leader before he served under long-serving prime minister Mark Rutte as climate minister.But not everything has worked out smoothly in Jetten's career. A parliamentary colleague complained he was \"pushy\" on the climate, and his big ambitions as minister were cut short when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.He led D66's disastrous campaign in 2023 when the party came away with only nine seats, two years after his predecessor Sigrid Kaag managed second place after Rutte.Jetten was not yet as fluent in front of the cameras. Some media appearances he gave were criticised as dull, and one critic labelled him \"Robot Jetten\".\"Robot Jetten is going to be prime minister!\" one reporter said to him incredulously as his success became clear on Wednesday night.\"Sometimes it can work out really crazy in politics,\" Jetten replied with a broad grin.EPAJetten fought a close race against anti-Islam populist Geert WildersSupporters see him as a kind of mini-Mark Rutte, who is now head of Nato. And that comparison will suit Jetten fine, as many Dutch now look back warmly on the stability of the Rutte years, after two years of relative turmoil.Both men always appear cheerful and pragmatic, and both are notorious for getting by on precious little sleep. However, party colleague Roy Kramer noticed a difference: \"Rutte is a chatterbox, Jetten is a bit quieter,\" he told Dutch newspaper Het Parool.The liberal leader has big ambitions, and few challenges are more pressing than tackling the Netherlands' housing crisis, with a shortage of some 400,000 homes.Jetten wants to build 10 cities and complains Dutch governments have not really achieved anything impressive for the past 10 to 15 years. He is making big promises and will come under pressure to deliver.For Jetten to succeed he will need some of Rutte's teflon political coating that saw him through four governments.He has already survived one awkward moment in the campaign, when a joke about Crown Princess Amalia fell flat in front of 2,000 students in Rotterdam.\"I think the best way of promoting work in the military is being able to end up training with the Crown Princess. I bet a few guys in this audience would be interested in that,\" he said.The debate moderator hit back saying: \"what kind of sexist remark is that?\"Jetten later admitted it was inappropriate, but it appears to have done him no harm.

    "body": "12 hours agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeThe Rapid Support Forces militia reportedly killed hundreds of civilians at the main hospital in el-Fasher, days after it captured the Sudanese city, the head of the UN's health agency says.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported killing of 460 people at the hospital.Earlier, the Sudan Doctors' Network said that on Tuesday RSF fighters had \"cold bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present\".It gave no casualty figures, but said medical facilities in the city had been \"transformed into human slaughterhouses\".The Sudan Doctors Network has also accused the RSF of kidnapping six medics - including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse - and reportedly demanding ransoms in excess of $150,000 (£114,000) for their release.Tuesday's attack on Saudi Hospital was also reported by the el-Fasher Resistance Committee, a group of local activists, which said there was \"a horrifying silence\" afterwards.The city had been the army's last stronghold in the Darfur region, and was captured by the RSF on Sunday after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.New videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneSince the conflict erupted in April 2023, the RSF and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups - allegations the RSF denies.With the fall of el-Fasher, the UN, activists and aid agencies have expressed fear over the fate of the estimated 250,000 people trapped in the city, many from non-Arab communities.A communications blackout has made it difficult to confirm what is happening.BBC Verify has analysed new videos posted to social media showing RSF fighters executing a number of unarmed people in the last few days.With the difficulties in getting reports from the ground, aid agencies say the full scale of the devastation in and around el-Fasher is only beginning to emerge.Some people have managed to make the dangerous journey to the town of Tawila, about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher, and described the extreme violence they faced.\"The shelling was so intense on Saturday that we had no choice but to flee el-Fashir,\" one man told BBC Arabic's Sudan Lifeline programme.\"Along the way, the RSF filmed us and we were beaten and insulted - and they stole what we had on the journey. A number of people were captured and ransoms were demanded for their release.\"Some of those who were taken were later executed. During the journey, many people were arrested, and we suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.\"Jan Egeland, a former top UN humanitarian official, told the BBC the situation was catastrophic.\"We have had massacres on top on all of those months of deprivation, starvation, no medical care,\" he said.\"I think this is the worst place on Earth now; it's the biggest humanitarian emergency on Earth and it happens in the dark, really - there has been far too little attention to what's happening in Sudan.\"Dr Tedros said prior to the Saudi Hospital attack, the WHO had verified 185 attacks on health care facilities since the start of the war, resulting in 1,204 deaths.\"All attacks on health care must stop immediately and unconditionally. All patients, health personnel and health facilities must be protected under international humanitarian law. Ceasefire!\" he said.The capture of el-Fasher effectively splits the country, with the RSF now in control of most of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",

    "body": "'Lost' spider species rediscovered after 40 years2 hours agoPA MediaAulonia albimana was last recorded in the UK in 1985A critically endangered spider not seen in the UK for 40 years has been rediscovered.Aulonia albimana, which was last recorded in the UK in 1985, was found at the National Trust's Newtown National Nature Reserve on the Isle of Wight.The team that found the tiny orange-legged arachnid has informally named it the white-knuckled wolf spider.Entomologist Mark Teller said: \"To find a species thought lost for 40 years is thrilling - and testament to how the right habitat management, combined with curiosity and collaboration, can deliver remarkable results.\"The nature reserve described the find as a \"major conservation success\".Aulonia albimana was in a remote overgrown area of the reserve accessible only by boat, about 2km (1.2 miles) away from the spider's former colony.Mr Teller, who found it with his colleague Graeme Lyons, called it \"one of those unforgettable discoveries\".Mr Lyons said: \"I suggested calling it the white-knuckled wolf spider because this was probably the longest long shot I've ever taken part in.\"We had just four hours at the site where this spider was last seen 40 years ago, before our boat came to pick us up.\"I found the first one with just nine minutes to go, and the second one in the last minute. \"I've seen 559 species of spider in the British Isles and this one was by far the most exciting find.\"Mr Teller said the name was also inspired by the distinctive pale \"knuckles\" on the small leg-like appendages at the side of the spider's mouth.PA MediaThe team that found the tiny orange-legged arachnid have named it the white-knuckled wolf spiderDr Helen Smith, conservation officer for the British Arachnological Society, said: \"The remarkable discovery of this dapper little spider on the Isle of Wight is one of Britain's epic 'lost species' rediscoveries of the century.\"With repeated failure to find it at its former sites, where its open habitat has been lost, it seemed increasingly likely that it had joined the country's sad list of extinct species.\"There are about 38 species of wolf spiders in the UK, named for their agile hunting skills, as they chase their prey along the ground and pounce on them.More on this storyRelated internet links",

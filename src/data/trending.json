    "body": "4 hours agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporter, BBC NewsGetty ImagesPizza Hut is to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery sites in the UK with the loss of 1,210 jobs, after the firm running them fell into administration.DC London Pie Limited, which operates Pizza Hut's UK restaurants, appointed FTI Consulting as administrators on Monday.However, Pizza Hut's global owner Yum! Brands has agreed to save 64 restaurants, preserving 1,276 jobs.Pizza Hut is well known for its family-friendly dining and salad bar, but its UK business has been struggling and had previously gone into administration less than a year ago.DC London Pie had bought Pizza Hut UK's restaurants from insolvency in January this year. The company also owns Pizza Hut franchises in Sweden and Denmark.A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"We are pleased to secure the continuation of 64 sites to safeguard our guest experience and protect the associated jobs.\"Nicolas Burquier, managing director for Pizza Hut Europe and Canada, said: \"This targeted acquisition aims to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible.\"He added that the immediate priority for Pizza Hut was \"operational continuity at the acquired locations and supporting colleagues through the transition\".Zoe Adjay, a senior lecturer in hospitality at the University of East London, said Pizza Hut had been \"at the forefront of bringing fast food into the UK\" in the 1970s, but had struggled to remain relevant amid increased competition.\"The pizza market has become a lot more upmarket,\" she said. \"There's a lot more high-end pizza and they've taken a huge market share.\"Ms Adjay added that Pizza Hut had also failed to establish itself on social media in the same way as some of its competitors.Increased operating costs and \"ongoing consumer caution\" will likely have contributed to Pizza Hut's challenges, according to Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.\"DC London Pie had rescued Pizza Hut's UK operations from insolvency less than a year ago, but making a success of a big-name casual dining businesses is a tough job.\"Taking back the brand looks a smart move by Yum! Brands as it has decades of data about how pizza lovers like to consume and exactly what factors need to coalesce to make a location a success.\"More on this story",

(When my leg is better),\" the 66-year-old added.BBC/PAThe actor had only just returned to the show, after missing his week three performance due to an illness.\"I had a little bit of a turn, a little bit of an episode with vertigo,\" he said during an appearance on companion programme Strictly: It Takes Two.\"But it was all OK, I made myself right again with the help of some good people at the hospital,\" he added.Dennis's return, in week four of the show on Saturday, saw him and Buswell secure their highest score of the series - performing a Charleston to the song Dance Monkey by Australian musician Tones and I.Strictly judge Shirley Ballas said Dennis had come \"back with a bang\", and that he had pushed his limits with a difficult routine.The pair are scheduled to be interviewed on Strictly: It Takes Two on Wednesday.Dennis is best known for playing Paul Robinson in Neighbours, the longest-running character in Australian television history.Following his first appearance in 1985, he went on to feature in 6,000 episodes across four decades.His partner Buswell made history this Strictly series - becoming the first professional dancer to compete on the show while pregnant.\"I'm still doing everything I did before,\" she said ahead of the beginning of the series.Speaking on her podcast Winning Isn't Everything, she added: \"Obviously with lifts there's going to be a bit more caution.

    "body": "2 hours agoNatalie ShermanBBC NewsAFP via Getty ImagesThe US and Australia have signed a deal intended to boost supplies of rare earths and other critical minerals, as the Trump administration looks for ways to counter China's dominance of the market. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the deal would support a pipeline of $8.5bn (£6.3bn) \"ready-to-go\" projects that would expand his country's mining and processing abilities. It includes $1bn to be invested by the two countries in projects in the US and Australia over the next six months, a framework text says.The US and Australia have been working on these issues since Trump's first term, but Albanese said the latest agreement would take the partnership to the \"next level\".China currently controls about 70% of rare earths mining and 90% of the processing of the materials, which are found in everything from defence equipment to computer chips and cars. US companies rely heavily on the materials, making them vulnerable this year as China has taken steps to restrict access to supplies in response to new US tariffs and other tensions. Albanese said the agreement was aimed at speeding investment in three types of projects, including US investments in processing facilities in Australia. The two countries also agreed to work together on issues such as pricing, permitting, and rules for government review of the sales of companies and projects in the sector. The US separately said it would invest in the construction of a 100 tonnes-per-year advanced gallium refinery in Western Australia and was preparing to offer some $2.2bn in financing to advance critical minerals projects via its Export-Import Bank. The Trump administration in recent months has already announced a series of investments in companies such as US rare earths miner MP Materials and Canada's Trilogy Metals and Lithium America's, which have projects in the US.In exchange for the support, it has received ownership stakes in the firms. Ahead of the meeting, shares in Australian companies such as Lynas Rare Earths had jumped on the prospect of increased support. Lynas was awarded a contract by the US Defense Department a few years ago and is working on a project in Texas.The framework published by the White House was light on details, reflecting the delicate issues at play. Australia is a major source of critical minerals but like the US, it relies on China, its biggest trade partner, for the processing required to turn the materials into something companies can use. ",

    "description": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country ",
    "body": "Japan has for the first time approved over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, its manufacturer says, allowing women in the country to take the medication without prescription.ASKA Pharmaceutical said wider access to the pill would \"empower Japanese women in the area of reproductive health\". A date for it to go on sale has yet to be announced.The pill will be labelled as \"medicine requiring guidance\", meaning women must take it in the presence of a pharmacist.The \"morning-after\" pill - a form of emergency contraception - is already available without prescription in more than 90 countries, and is designed to prevent an unwanted pregnancy.It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing or attaching to the wall of the uterus. It usually has to be taken within three to five days of having unprotected sex - but the sooner it is taken, the more effective it is.Japan's conservative views, rooted in patriarchy and deeply traditional views on the role of women, mean it has been slow to approve drugs related to women's reproductive health.ASKA Pharmaceutical said in a statement on Monday that it \"has obtained the marketing authorisation as a switch to OTC [over-the-counter] use of the emergency contraceptive pill commercialised under the trademark Norlevo\".There will be no age restrictions on buyers and no requirement for parental consent, the daily newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported.The company said it had filed for regulatory approval in 2024, following prescription-free trial sales of the pill the year before.During the trial, Norlevo was made available at 145 pharmacies in Japan. Until then, the pill had only been supplied at clinics or pharmacies with a doctor's examination and prescription.At the time, rights groups criticised the trial, saying it was too small, and called for restrictions to be lifted. Campaigners have long argued that requiring a prescription deterred younger women and rape victims from accessing emergency contraception.Selling the drug without prescription was first discussed by a health ministry panel in 2017 - the public consultation found overwhelming support across the country.But officials stopped short of giving it the green light then, saying that making it more easily available would encourage irresponsible use of the \"morning-after\" pill.Norlevo - and the generic version levonorgestrel - works best within 72 hours after unprotected sex and has an efficacy rate of 80%.",

    "body": "Hamas has handed over a body that it says is a hostage, the Israeli military has said.The body was transported by the Red Cross to Israeli forces in Gaza, and will now be returned to Israel for formal identification.Before Monday, Hamas had handed over all 20 living hostages and 12 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal that began on 10 October.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not yet returned all the deceased hostages, with the Israeli military saying the Palestinian armed group \"is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has said it faces difficulty finding bodies under rubble in Gaza.Under the agreement, Israel has also freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.The first phase has also seen an increase of aid into the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in fighting - though deadly violence flared up on Sunday as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel said it struck dozens of Hamas targets across the Strip after accusing Hamas of an attack that killed two of its soldiers in Rafah. Hamas had said it was \"unaware\" of any clashes in the area, which is under Israeli control.At least 45 Palestinians were killed in the strikes, local hospitals said.On Sunday evening, Israel said it was resuming enforcement of the ceasefire, adding that it would \"respond firmly to any violation of it\". Hamas had earlier said it remained committed to the agreement.US President Donald Trump said the truce remained in place, as his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner travelled to Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently holds about half of Gaza, demarcated by a so-called Yellow Line.With Palestinians expressing confusion about the exact location of the line, the IDF has put out a video showing bulldozers towing yellow blocks into place to mark it out.On Monday, Palestinian health officials said Israeli fire killed three people east of Gaza City. The IDF said its troops fired towards \"several terrorists\" who crossed the Yellow Line in the Shejaiya area.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,216 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "5 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterMcVitie's Penguin and Club bars are no longer classed as chocolate after rising cocoa prices led the makers to switch to using other ingredients.Club bars had previously been marketed under the slogan: \"If you like a lot of chocolate on your biscuit, join our club\". But both treats are now described as \"chocolate flavour\" because the amount of cocoa they contain has been reduced after owner Pladis had to find cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.The UK sources cocoa beans from West Africa and poor harvests as a result of severe drought conditions in cocoa-producing countries, such as Ivory Coast and Ghana, have led to restricted supplies and higher prices.The change to the bars' ingredients was first reported by trade journal The Grocer.A spokesperson for Pladis said: \"We made some changes to McVitie's Penguin and Club earlier this year, where we are using a chocolate flavour coating with cocoa mass, rather than a chocolate coating.\"\"Sensory testing with consumers shows the new coatings deliver the same great taste as the originals,\" the spokesperson added.The company said it was committed to delivering \"great-tasting snacks\" while managing rising costs, and it only adjusted its recipes when \"necessary\".Confectionery historian Alex Hutchinson said many confectioners were lowering the amount of cocoa ingredients in their chocolate in favour of cheaper alternatives. When processed, a cocoa bean becomes cocoa liquor, which contains 50% each of cocoa solids and cocoa butter.But manufacturers looking to save costs can reduce the amount of ingredients they use which are directly from the bean, and instead use alternatives such as palm oil or shea butter.For milk chocolate to be classified as such, UK regulations say it should be made up of about 20% cocoa solids, slightly lower than EU regulations which stipulate a minimum of 25%.The move from Pladis, which owns well-known household favourites such as McVities, Godiva, Go Ahead and Jacobs, means the firm is now using less than 20% cocoa-bean derived ingredients in its \"chocolate\" coating for Club and Penguin.Although cocoa commodity prices have eased slightly recently, a surge in costs over the past three years led to pricier Easter eggs and squeezed profit margins at some chocolate-sellers.\"During my lifetime the cost of cocoa has stayed around $3,500 (£2,607) dollars a tonne and last year it soared to $11,500 (£8,567) a tonne,\" said Ms Hutchinson.\"Chocolate costs more than ever before,\" she added.",

    "body": "The US agency that oversees the country's nuclear stockpile will temporarily lay off about 1,400 of its employees as the government shutdown enters its 20th day.  Fewer than 400 employees will remain after the furloughs at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a semi-autonomous agency within the US Department of Energy, a spokesperson told the BBC. The department is tasked with improving national security by safeguarding the US nuclear stockpile and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe. The NNSA has never before furloughed workers since its establishment in 2000. \"We are left with no choice this time,\" spokesperson Ben Dietderich said.\"We've extended funding as long as we could,\" he said.Thousands of federal workers have been laid off after three weeks of government shutdown, with the White House warning of further cuts if the government does not reopen. The energy department said NNSA's Office of Secure Transportation, responsible for transporting nuclear weapons, had enough funding to operate until 27 October. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is expected to discuss the furloughs and shutdown during a news conference in Nevada on Monday. Wright said in an interview last week that the US' nuclear stockpile would remain secure, but said the furloughs would hamper efforts to modernise older weapons in the stockpile. On Monday, the US Senate is again expected to vote on a measure already passed by the US House of Representatives to fund the government. The bill has failed to pass the Senate 10 times. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune is planning to introduce a bill this week to pay federal employees and military service members who are still working through the shutdown while not receiving their salaries. Like military personnel, federal law enforcement officers are considered \"essential\" and are still expected to report for duty, even without pay.Around 1.4 million federal employees are on unpaid leave or working without pay.The shutdown came after Republicans and Democrats could not agree to pass a bill funding government services into October and beyond. Democrats are pushing for a boost to healthcare funding - including tax credits that make health insurance cheaper for millions - in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans have argued the health care issues should be handled separately from budget negotiations after the government is reopened. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorAmazon Web Services (AWS) has had a bad day.That's how the boss of another big US tech firm Cloudflare put it – probably feeling very relieved that today's outage, hitting over 1,000 companies and affecting millions of internet users, had nothing to do with him.The places hit by the outage vary significantly. It took out major social media platforms like Snapchat and Reddit, banks like Lloyds and Halifax, and games like Roblox and Fortnite. AWS is a US giant with a large global footprint, having positioned itself as the backbone of the internet.It provides tools and computers which enable around a third of the internet to work, it offers storage space and database management, it saves firms from having to maintain their own costly set-ups, and it also connects traffic to those platforms.That's how it sells its services: let us look after your business's computing needs for you.But today something very mundane went very wrong: a common kind of outage known as a Domain Name System (DNS) error. People who work in the tech industry will be rolling their eyes right now.This common error can cause a lot of havoc.\"It's always DNS!\" is something I hear a lot. When someone taps an app or clicks a link, their device is essentially sending a request to be connected to that service.DNS is supposed to act like a map, and today AWS lost its bearings – platforms like Snapchat, Canva and HMRC were all still there but it couldn't see where they were to direct traffic to them.These errors happen for a number of reasons.Usually it's a maintenance issue or a server failure. Sometimes that's human error, someone misconfiguring something somewhere, or in extreme cases a cyber attack - although there's no evidence of this so far.AWS said it occurred at its vast data centre plant in northern Virginia, its oldest and biggest site.A chorus of experts have said today is a textbook illustration of the risks of putting all of your eggs in one basket in terms of a service provider - AWS is a giant and millions of businesses rely on it.And they are right, but the issue is there aren't many alternatives at the sheer scale provided by AWS. There are only two main contenders in fact, and they're both other US giants: Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform.Smaller rivals include IBM and the Chinese firm Alibaba. The parent company of the supermarket Lidl launched a European rival called Stackit last year, in direct competition with Amazon.But AWS remains the dominant player by some margin.Some argue the UK and Europe urgently needs to build up its own infrastructure and be less reliant on the US for cloud services – while others say it's too late. Someone working in government once told me an MP informally proposed creating a UK version of AWS.\"But what's the point?\" came the reply. \"We already have AWS, over there.\"Perhaps incidents like today's highlight why it's not quite that simple.",

    "body": "Kevin Federline has held off writing about Britney Spears. Until now8 minutes agoAna Faguy andJames FitzGeraldGetty ImagesThe pair's divorce was finalised in 2007The ex-husband of pop star Britney Spears gives new details on the pair's tense relationship in his new memoir You Thought You Knew.Kevin Federline, her one-time backing dancer, presents a picture of Spears's allegedly erratic behaviour as a wife and mother, and says he continues to have concerns for her wellbeing.Spears has spoken out against the book, which will be published on Tuesday, and accuses Federline of trying to profit from his association with her.Federline makes a number of allegations against Spears, in the memoir shared with the BBC ahead of the book's release by publisher Listenin. He accuses Spears of unhealthy behaviour as a mother, including drinking when she was pregnant and taking cocaine while her two sons were still breastfeeding. Spears has previously denied having substance abuse issues.When they were teenagers, the couple's sons were fearful of Spears, Federline also alleges. \"They would awaken sometimes at night to find her standing silently in the doorway, watching them sleep - 'Oh, you're awake?' - with a knife in her hand,\" he writes. \"Then she'd turn around and pad off without explanation.\"Federline also expresses his concern for his estranged ex-wife, writing: \"The truth is, this situation with Britney feels like it's racing toward something irreversible. From where I sit, the clock is ticking, and we're getting close to the 11th hour.\"He writes that he was supportive of a conservatorship, under which many aspects of Spears's life were controlled by others for years. Of the Free Britney movement, Federline writes that he could \"never fully get behind it\".What's the history of their relationship?The pair got together in the summer of 2004, after Spears's commercial peak.They married a few months later and quickly welcomed their two sons: Preston, now 20, and Jayden, now 19.Spears filed for divorce in 2006 and the divorce was finalised in 2007.The couple fought publicly over custody of their sons and ultimately Federline was given sole custody of the boys.In the wake of Federline getting full custody, Spears was seen behaving in a way that Federline characterises in his book as erratic.She made headlines with incidents like shaving her head and hitting a photographer's car with an umbrella.Those public incidents raised concern about her mental welfare, and after she was taken to hospital twice, a temporary conservatorship was established in 2008 and made permanent later that year.Spears remained under that controversial arrangement until 2021, under which her father and others controlled her finances and aspects of her personal life. She did not regain custody of her children until after it was lifted.What has Spears said? Spears has accused Federline of attacking her during his recent press appearances to promote the book. She described the contents of the memoir as \"extremely hurtful and exhausting\", but suggested the work would sell better than her own memoir had done.In that book, The Woman in Me, Spears accused her ex-husband of trying to \"convince everyone I was completely out of control\".Spears has also defended her relationship with her sons. \"I have always pleaded and screamed to have a life with my boys,\" she wrote on social media on 15 October, adding that \"relationships with teenage boys is complex\".In a statement to US media, a Spears spokesperson added: \"With news from Kevin's book breaking, once again he and others are profiting off her and sadly it comes after child support has ended with Kevin. All she cares about are her kids, Sean Preston and Jayden James, and their well-being during this sensationalism. She detailed her journey in her memoir.\"The BBC has contacted Federline's lawyer for comment on Spears's counter-accusations.Why is this happening now?While the pair dominated headlines during their relationship and subsequent divorce, Federline in particular has largely remained out of the limelight in recent years. And recently, the spotlight on Spears has largely been over her social media postings.Federline has said he considered writing a book for many years but wanted to wait until his children were older to complete it.\"I picked it up and put it down quite a lot over probably a five-year period,\" he told the Associated Press. \"I think that it's a very good description of me, who I am, the father I've become, the husband I am, the ex-husband I am.\"He also told AP: \"I want my children to be able to move forward in their lives and know that the actual truth of everything is out there.\"",

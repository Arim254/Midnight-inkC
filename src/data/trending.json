Sarah's body was found later that evening, with police still searching for Grace.As Humberside Police released more details, James Dick OBE - the King's representative for the county - said: \"I am investigating the most appropriate way to recognise Mark Ratcliffe's selfless act of bravery\".Phillip Norton/BBCPolice continue their efforts to try to locate Grace Keeling Dick, the lord-lieutenant for the East Riding of Yorkshire, added: \"It is a very tragic situation where three people have lost their lives.\"My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved and also to the community of Withernsea, which is feeling such a tragic loss.\"His office would be \"contacting people involved in the awards process to understand which award is the most appropriate\", he added.Mark was from Withernsea while Sarah and Grace were from Nottinghamshire, police said.Paying tribute, Mark's family previously described him as a \"true selfless hero with a heart of gold, who was so cruelly taken trying to save others\".On Tuesday, Ch Insp Tom Stevens gave further details of the circumstances of the deaths.He said: \"From trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses who were in the area at the time, it is understood that Grace and her friend were on the steps near to the rocks when Grace is believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave.\"Grace's mum, Sarah, and three other members of the public who were nearby at the time, including Mark, immediately entered the water in an effort to save Grace.\"'Finding Grace is priority' Stevens said that two of those three who also entered the water in an attempt to assist with the rescue managed to exit safely.He added: \"Our priority now is to find Grace, and we are doing everything we can to locate her. This includes extensive searches along the shoreline and drone searches from Withernsea to Easington directed by our specialist search teams.\"Stevens said its underwater search unit had also been deployed and officers had consulted with an oceanographer.Both families continue to be supported by officers, Stevens said.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "9 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterPA MediaThe US military action in Venezuela was the right thing to do \"morally\", Kemi Badenoch has said.The Conservative leader told the BBC that while she did not understand the legal basis for Donald Trump's operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from the country, he was overseeing a \"brutal regime\" and she was \"glad he's gone\".However, she added that the move did \"raise serious questions about the rules-based order\".The UK government has so far avoided criticising the US move or saying whether it breached international law, instead arguing that Maduro was an \"illegitimate president\".However, some Labour MPs and opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats, Green Party and SNP have called on the government to condemn Trump's actions and brand them illegal.Badenoch told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the US action was \"extraordinary\" but she understood why it was taken.\"Where the legal certainty is not yet clear, morally, I do think it was the right thing to do,\" she said.The Tory leader, who spent her childhood in Nigeria before moving back to the UK at the age of 16, added: \"I grew up under a military dictatorship, so I know what it's like to have someone like Maduro in charge.\"However, she said it was right to tell Trump not to intervene in Greenland because \"there is a big difference between democratic states\" and the \"gangster state in Venezuela\".\"What happens in Greenland is up to Denmark and the people of Greenland,\" she added.In recent days Trump has repeated his threats to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory which has a strategic location and is rich in minerals - arguing it is vital for US national security.The UK has issued a joint statement with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark insisting it is for Denmark and Greenland alone to decide on matters concerning the territory's future.Health Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC Breakfast the UK's approach to Greenland was different to Venezuela as Denmark was a member of the Nato military alliance and it was not in the UK's national security interests to question the territory's future.Streeting also defended the prime minister's response to the developments in Venezuela, arguing he was acting in the UK's national interest, as well as the \"best interests of the people of Venezuela\".\"I appreciate there are others who have been more strident and have been more critical of the United States,\" he said.\"The prime minister has a different responsibility, and he is choosing his words carefully and wisely to try and influence how events unfold from here on.\"Critics of the government's approach, including Labour MP Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have argued the US action risks emboldening Russia and China and that the UK should be clear the operation breached international law.In a statement in the House of Commons on Monday evening, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had reminded her US counterpart Marco Rubio of his obligations under international law.However, she reiterated the prime minister's position that it is for the US to set out the legal basis for its actions.Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife were seized from Caracas on Saturday in an operation by US forces which also saw strikes on military bases in the country.The pair have been taken to New York where they have been charged with weapon and drug offences, accused of enriching themselves from a violent crime ring smuggling cocaine to the US.Maduro has long rejected the allegations as a pretext to force him from power and both have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them.Trump has vowed to \"run the country\" until there is a \"proper\" transition of power, with Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as interim president.",

    "body": "Is AI taking the fun out of fantasy football?10 hours agoJack GrayandYasmin Malik,BBC NewsbeatPA WireAI tools offer \"expert management\" that could help you top your mini-leagueFor years, fantasy football has given every armchair manager the space to back up claims they \"could do a better job\" than the real thing.Whether you're competing against workmates, family members or strangers, the ability to pull together your own dream team is irresistible to millions of football fans.The competitive pastime has spawned a whole industry of content creators offering weekly tips for anyone looking to gain an edge as they sift through stats and manage transfers.Recently, more players have been turning to Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for advice - but not everyone agrees they have a place in the virtual dugout.Ryan JordanContent creator Ryan Jordan posts fantasy football tips and advice to TikTokFantasy Premier League (FPL) is the UK's most popular fantasy league, and claims to have more than 11 million players taking part.Users select squads of 15 footballers, who each earn points based on their weekly on-pitch performance. The catch? A £100m budget, constant price changes, and a strict limit on how many players you're allowed from each side. Content creator Ryan Jordan, who posts fantasy football tips and advice to his 15,000 followers on TikTok, says FPL makes the real-life game \"more engaging to watch\".The Bristol City fan says it encourages him to pay attention to teams he might not usually follow, and makes \"every match really matter\".  \"So even a team lower in the table that you might not want to watch on TV each week, you'll watch it because you've a player from their team in your FPL team,\" he says.\"It brings the community together to watch a lot more.\"Fantasy Football HubFantasy Football Hub gives players advice, including possible transfersRyan tells BBC Newsbeat he uses Fantasy Football Hub, an app which offers AI tools, including one that rates a manager's squad. He says it gives advice on transfers, predicts how many points a certain player will achieve each week, and when it's best to play or bench them.Fantasy Football Hub's founder Will Thomas told Newsbeat the app has attracted about 793,000 members since it launched in 2019, with about 59,000 of those paying a subscription to access AI features.Of those paid members, he said, about 28,000 signed up in 2025, with about 381,000 joining as free members.Fantasy Football Fix, another popular app, told Newsbeat it had also seen user numbers climb.It now has 690,000 members overall, up from about half a million in 2022.The company believes one of its key features, an AI-powered chatbot the company says is trained on \"FPL-specific\" data, has contributed to the increase.Newsbeat understands the Premier League is set to add features to its official Companion app, which uses Microsoft's Copilot, to help users pick fantasy teams and strategies later in the season. But do AI tools actually do what they claim?Ryan says he mostly finds Fantasy Football Hub reliable. \"A lot of the time, some of the players they put in there are spot-on,\" he says.\"I'm not going to lie, there are some times I see a player and I think: 'What's he doing in there?'\"In groups dedicated to fantasy football on Reddit and other platforms, some users argue that the subscription apps don't provide insights or data which players can't get elsewhere. And one of the biggest complaints is that they remove the elements of gut instinct and luck that keep people hooked on fantasy leagues.Ryan says he understands why some people are against AI use, but he sees it as similar to getting advice from YouTube or podcasts.\"At the end of the day, I think people should play FPL in whatever way they enjoy most,\" he says.\"AI tools don't replace skill, they just support decision-making.\"Villa fan Jake reckons AI should stay on the benchTwo-thirds of FPL players who replied to a survey from Virgin Media O2 published in August said they were planning to use AI this season.However, many respondents told the company it \"takes the fun out of the game\" and others felt it was \"outright cheating\".It's a view that Newsbeat encountered among fans travelling for the Aston Villa v Manchester United match in Birmingham last month.Supporters told us they felt puzzled by others using AI to help them pick their squads.When we spoke to Jake Thomas O'Donnell, a long-time FPL player, in Birmingham city centre, he was also unimpressed.\"I think AI ruins the banter a little bit,\" the Aston Villa fan said.\"People that use AI have no clue what they're doing and automatically become these great people.\"It should be done by the person.\"Other players we spoke to say they weren't too fussed about it - and some didn't even know AI was used by others. 'I don't really see it spoiling the game'Dani GonçalvesDani Gonçalves co-created Aerial Fantasy which follows the Women's Super LeagueDani Gonçalves is a co-creator of Aerial Fantasy, one of several unofficial fantasy games developed for the Women's Super League after England's Lionesses won the 2022 Euros.It opened the 2025-26 season with more than 30,000 users.Dani argues there is little difference between following advice from an AI chatbot and a fantasy football \"expert\", such as a podcaster.\"People have always been trying to game the system and figure out a way to get the edge,\" she tells Newsbeat.\"I don't really see it spoiling the game.\"Dani admits there is a risk that widespread AI use could lead to lots of similar-looking teams as \"everyone's using the same data\".But she says those running fantasy leagues can use incentives to encourage players away from obvious or popular picks.Aerial Fantasy, for example, offers \"visionary points\", or bonuses, boosting rewards for those who choose lesser-picked squad members.Dani says there can also be a benefit for players who do enjoy the old-fashioned method of trawling stats and spreadsheets to optimise their teams.\"Some players really enjoy digging through all the data and finding that gem, and obviously using AI does make that faster,\" she says.\"They're almost more engaged than the person who is rolling the dice and just picking a random person.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.More on this ",

    "body": "4 hours agoOlivia IrelandWatch: Ski bar not checked for five years and sparklers now banned, mayor saysThe Swiss bar that was the scene of a fire which killed 40 people and injured 116 had not undergone safety checks for five years, authorities have said.The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, told a Tuesday news conference that he could not explain why Le Constellation bar had not been checked in so long, but that the council was \"profoundly sorry\". The venues should have been checked annually.\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" \"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.ReutersPeople in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fireWhen the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers under criminal investigation, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. More on this storyFeraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. \"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoChloe AslettYorkshireBBCThe incident occurred on the road between Dinnington and TodwickA police force has admitted mixing up the identities of an 18-year-old killed in a car crash with another teenager who survived the collision.South Yorkshire Police said officers had wrongly told relatives of Trevor Wynn, 17, that he had died in the crash near Rotherham in December.Meanwhile, the force incorrectly identified Joshua Johnson, 18, as having survived the collision, which also resulted in the death of a 17-year-old girl.Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) since identifying the error, adding that he was aware of \"the additional trauma this may cause\".Police were called to Todwick Road between Dinnington and Todwick in the early hours of 13 December after a silver Toyota Corolla crashed off the road.At the time the force said a 17-year-old girl, who was driving, and a 17-year-old boy had been pronounced dead at the scene, while an 18-year-old male had been taken to hospital with serious injuries.Wynn's family were subsequently told he had died while it was believed that Johnson was the male in hospital receiving treatment.However, in a statement issued on Tuesday, the force said \"concerns\" had been raised about the identities of those killed.A spokesperson said \"information came to light\" on Sunday which prompted \"further formal identification processes, including forensics, to be undertaken\" and resulted in the mistake being identified.South Yorkshire PoliceAssistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said the force had referred itself to the IOPCMcFarlane said he had since offered to meet with both sets of parents to discuss the matter.He said: \"This has obviously come as a huge shock to everyone and we recognise the additional trauma this may cause. \"We are supporting Trevor and all the families through this and have engaged specialist agencies to help provide that support. \"I have also offered to meet with both sets of parents as I am sure they will have many questions, most of which we are not able to answer yet but we are absolutely committed to understanding how this happened so it cannot happen again.\"He said South Yorkshire Police would fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation by the police watchdog.Wynn was not named publicly by police at the time of the crash, but was widely identified on social media and in local news outlets as having died in the collision.The 17-year-old girl has not been formally named.An 18-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and a 19-year-old arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the crash both remain on bail pending further enquiries.The IOPC said it was assessing the referral to determine whether an investigation was required.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBloomberg via Getty ImagesTechnology Secretary Liz Kendall has called on Elon Musk's X to urgently deal with its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok being used to create non-consensual sexualised images of women and girls.The BBC has seen multiple examples on X of people asking the bot to digitally undress people to make them appear in bikinis without their consent, as well as putting them in sexual situations.Kendall said the situation was \"absolutely appalling\", adding \"we cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these degrading images.\"In a statement, X said: \"We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” the statement continued.On Monday, the regulator Ofcom said it had made \"urgent contact\" with Elon Musk's company xAI and said it was investigating concerns Grok has been producing \"undressed images\" of people.Kendall has endorsed the regulator’s actions.\"It is absolutely right that Ofcom is looking into this as a matter of urgency and it has my full backing to take any enforcement action it deems necessary,\" she said.'Dehumanising' imagesGrok is a free AI assistant - with some paid-for premium features - which responds to X users' prompts when they tag it in a post.It is often used to give reaction or more context to other posters' remarks.But people on X are also able to use it to edit an uploaded image through its AI image editing feature without the consent of the person depicted.Women who have stumbled across sexualised images of themselves made by Grok have described it as dehumanising.Dr Daisy Dixon is one of the many female X users who recently started to see people take everyday pictures she had posted of herself on the platform and ask Grok to undress her or sexualise her. She told the BBC the pictures left her feeling \"shocked\", \"humiliated\" and frightened for her safety.She added while she backed the call from the technology secretary for action and found it \"heartening\", she still felt frustrated with X's lack of accountability.Dr Daisy DixonDr Daisy Dixon has seen people on X use her pictures and ask Grok to undress her\"Myself and many other women on X continue to report the inappropriate AI images/videos we are being sent daily, but X continues to reply that there has been no violation of X rules,\" she said.\"I just hope Kendall's words turn into concrete enforcement soon – I don't want to open my X app anymore as I'm frightened about what I might see.\"In her statement Kendall said: \"Services and operators have a clear obligation to act appropriately. This is not about restricting freedom of speech but upholding the law.\"We have made intimate image abuse and cyberflashing priority offences under the Online Safety Act - including where images are AI-generated. This means platforms must prevent such content from appearing online and act swiftly to remove it if it does.\"The leader of the Liberal Democrats Sir Ed Davey urged the government to \"act very quickly\" to stop the generation of sexualised images by Grok, suggesting one course of action would be to \"reduce access\" to X.\"If the reports turn out to be true the National Crime Agency need to launch a criminal investigation,\" Sir Ed said.\"People like Elon Musk have to be held to account.\"Speaking to BBC Newshour, Thomas Regnier, spokesman for tech sovereignty at the European Commission, said they were taking the issue \"very seriously\".\"We don't want this in the European Union... it's appalling, it's disgusting.\"The Wild West is over in Europe,\" he said. \"All companies have the obligation to put their own house in order – and this starts by being responsible and removing illegal content that is being generated by your AI tool.\"",

Friedman Theatre in New York.Joan says it was strange to watch her part played by former Coronation Street star Julie Hesmondhalgh.\"Some bits are obviously quite painful, when she has to do the life support machine bit and meeting Jacob bit, and talking about James, it is very hard hearing all that from somebody else,\" she says.Nottingham Playhouse/Marc BrennerJulie Hesmondhalgh, left, plays the part of Joan in Punch Joan and Jacob have appeared on stage together for Q&A sessions after recent performances, where she agrees that people can find it extraordinary to see them hug each other.\"It is - but I've got to move forward and I didn't want to be consumed with grief and this is my way forward, to get some good out of him,\" says Joan.\"Other people in his gang have changed their life around because of it, so surely some good's coming out of it.\"Now Joan, who lives in South Derbyshire, wants restorative justice to be offered routinely to victims and perpetrators of traumatic crimes, and she is convinced her son would approve.She says: \"I think James would be honoured and amazed, because he was one to help youngsters, so to me that's coming full circle.\"More on this story",

    "body": "28 minutes agoPatrick JacksonandKayleen Devlin,BBC Verify senior journalistThe US may act to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker heading across the Atlantic to Europe, CBS News, the BBC's media partner in the US, reported.Two US officials told the broadcaster that American forces plan to intercept the ship, which historically has carried Venezuelan crude oil and is thought to be between Scotland and Iceland.President Donald Trump said last month that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the government there described as \"theft\".Ahead of his seizure of the country's former leader Nicolás Maduro on Saturday, Trump had repeatedly accused Venezuela's government of using ships to bring drugs to American shores.The US coastguard tried to board the Bella 1 last month in the Caribbean when it was believed to be heading towards Venezuela.They had obtained a warrant to seize the ship, accused of breaking US sanctions and shipping Iranian oil.It then dramatically changed course, as well as its name to the Marinera, reportedly reflagging from a Guyanan to a Russian vessel.Its approach to Europe has coincided with the arrival of around 10 US military transport aircraft in the UK as well as helicopters.Russia says it is \"monitoring with concern\" the situation around the ship.CBS News reported that the two US officials said American forces preferred to seize the ship rather than sink it.The Marinera is believed to be between Scotland and Iceland, with the distance and weather making a boarding difficult.If any US military operation were to be launched from the UK then Washington would be expected to inform its ally. For now the UK Ministry of Defence says it will not comment on other nations' military activities.They suggested that the US could mount an operation like one conducted last month when US Marines and special operation forces working with the US Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel left port in Venezuela.AIS (automatic identification system) tracking data for the tanker, which can be spoofed or faked, suggests it was in the North Atlantic approximately 2,000km (1,200 miles) west of continental Europe on Tuesday.Under international law, vessels flying a country's flag are under the protection of that nation but Dimitris Ampatzidis, senior risk and compliance analyst at maritime intelligence firm Kpler, told BBC Verify changing the ship's name and flag might not change much.\"US action is driven by the vessel's underlying identity [IMO number], ownership/control networks, and sanctions history, not by its painted markings or flag claim,\" he said.Ampatzidis added that changing to the Russian registry might cause \"diplomatic friction\" but would not stop any US enforcement action.Russia's foreign ministry said it was \"closely monitoring with concern the abnormal situation around the Russian oil tanker Marinera\".\"At present, our vessel is sailing in the international waters of the North Atlantic under the state flag of the Russian Federation and in full compliance with the norms of international maritime law,\" it added.\"For reasons unclear to us, the Russian ship is being given increased and clearly disproportionate attention by the US and Nato military, despite its peaceful status,\" it said. \"We expect that Western countries, which declare their commitment to freedom of navigation on the high seas, will begin adhering to this principle themselves.\"The potential stand-off over the oil tanker comes days after the US shocked the world by using military force to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a Russian ally, from the capital Caracas.It bombarded targets in the city during the operation to extricate him and his wife on suspicion of weapon and drug offences.

    "body": "4 hours agoShiona McCallum,Senior technology reporter, CES in Las Vegas,Liv McMahonandEmma Calder,Technology reportersAFP via Getty ImagesLego has unveiled Smart Bricks - tech-filled versions of its small building blocks - which it says will bring sets to life with sound, light and reaction to movement.However, the new product range is causing unease among play experts, who say it risks undermining what makes Lego special for children in an increasingly digital world.Announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, the Danish toymaker's Smart Play system introduces new electronic components to the classic plastic blocks.Lego says its new tech-enabled products, launching in March with a new Star Wars set, are its \"most revolutionary innovation\" in nearly 50 years.But Josh Golin, executive director of children's wellbeing group Fairplay, believes Smart Bricks \"undermine what was once great about Legos\" - harnessing children's own imagination during play.\"As anyone who has ever watched a child play with old-school Legos knows, children's Lego creations already do move and make noises through the power of children's imaginations,\" he told the BBC. \"But with the release of Smart Bricks, Lego is taking play out of the hands of children and putting it into the tiny sensors of these so-called 'smart' devices.\"Andrew Manches, professor of children and technology at the University of Edinburgh, agreed the beauty of Lego lay in \"the freedom to create, re-create, and adapt simple blocks into endless stories powered by children's imagination\".But he also welcomed Lego's efforts to integrate physical and digital play with tools that react to the way children interact with its Smart Play products.Julia Goldin, the company's chief product and marketing officer, previously told the BBC it viewed digital technology as an opportunity to \"expand physical play and physical building\".\"We don't look at the digital world as a threat,\" she said - adding its smart range weaves interactivity \"seamlessly\" with its physical products.What are Lego Smart Bricks?Lego says its Smart Bricks can sense motion, position and distance, allowing the models to respond in various ways during play.Measuring 2x4, the brick itself contains sensors, lights, a small sound synthesiser, an accelerometer and a custom-made silicon chip enabling it to detect movement and react to it.But it is designed to be used with Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags tiles - two additional products making up Lego's Smart Play System.Similarly adapted from existing Lego components, these possess digital identifiers triggering different sounds or reactions when they detect and interact with each other.For instance, when tried out by the BBC at CES, a Lego birthday cake recognised when its \"candles\" were blown out - sounding a cheer and a happy birthday song.Meanwhile, a Lego helicopter made whooshing sounds when moved or rotated, with its Smart Brick lighting up red upon crashing.Using a wireless system developed by Lego, the three models communicate with each other to produce particular responses through the Smart Brick.Tom Donaldson, head of Lego's Creative Play Lab, said the tech intended to respond to children's actions and complement the way they naturally play.He said the Smart Brick's reactions to responses would \"hopefully inspire and surprise the user to keep them continuing to play\".\"We are building a platform that we want to last for many years,\" he said.Prof Manches told the BBC reduced cost and size of components has \"enabled more toymakers to integrate digital technology seamlessly into a range of toys\".But he added despite exciting innovation, concerns remain about the security and privacy of new and emerging smart toys for children - particularly those which integrate AI. \"The key is to us all to remain critically reflective of the design of these toys, and to pay much attention to how they influence children's everyday lives,\" he said.It is not the first time Lego has dabbled in digital experimentation or sought to appeal to increasingly online audiences.Since 2017 it has released augmented reality apps and experiences letting people play with computer-generated models layered over their surroundings.Through collaborations with video game publishers such as Nintendo and Fortnite-maker Epic Games it has also looked to appeal to fans of trending games or new launches - releasing a Super Mario Minifigure in 2020 with a tiny display screen.Lego chief executive Niels B. Christiansen said in the firm’s 2024 annual report it had accelerated spending on digital technology as a \"strategic area\" for the company.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAlice Cuddy,reporting from Cúcuta, on the Colombia-Venezuela borderandVanessa Buschschlüter,Latin America editor, BBC News OnlineReutersPolice guarded the National Assembly where Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in MondayAt least 14 members of the press were detained in Venezuela on Monday as they were covering the aftermath of the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro by US forces. The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organisations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter deported. Foreign news media have long faced restrictions in Venezuela, with very few being granted visas to work in the country. Their detention came as Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as the interim president and shortly after she said that she was willing to co-operate with the Trump administration, which has said it would \"run\"  Venezuela.The union said the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, and in the neighbourhood of Altamira - all in the capital, Caracas.At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service.They said they had their equipment searched, their phones checked and their social media posts and messages read, the union statement added. A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta.The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, the statement said. The union called the incidents \"alarming\" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country. The repression has not been confined to media workers.One community leader in the neighbourhood of Petare, in Caracas, told BBC Mundo that there were \"hooded men with guns patrolling, checking people's WhatsApp statuses\".Caracas resident José, 60, said that people were not able to talk freely about what was happening, with a heavy police and military presence on the streets, as well as pro-Maduro armed groups, known as \"colectivos\", wearing masks.A 33-year-old masseuse, who did not want to be named, said there was \"so much fear in the streets and in our homes\".Members of the government appeared keen to show that the security forces were visible in communities, with the Interior Minister, Diosdado Cabello, posting a photo of himself on Monday night posing with armed police.Their presence has struck fear in people critical of the government. One woman described how there are \"military people on every corner and groups of armed civilians supporting the government who are causing fear among the population\".Another person who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC that \"the regime is not allowing news to come out of here.\" They added that \"there are uniformed personnel on the streets stopping people and checking their phones\".Instagram/@Minsjustice_VEInterior Minister Diosdado Cabello (shown right-of-centre wearing a black cap with red writing) posted this photo on InstagramThe journalist detentions come at a volatile time in Venezuela, where just days ago the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife were seized by US forces in a pre-dawn raid in which dozens of his bodyguards and security detail were killed.While the seizure prompted celebrations among Venezuelans who oppose Maduro and who have left the country, there were no public displays of joy in Venezuela.Opposition Venezuelans have long denounced the repression they face if they speak out against the Maduro government. More than 2,000 people were arrested during protests in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.The government-dominated electoral council declared Maduro the winner of that election but voting tallies collected by the opposition and verified by independent media suggest that it was won by the opposition candidate. In the crackdown which followed the election, members of the security forces checked people's phone for messages critical of Maduro, prompting many Venezuelans to erase their social media accounts and message history. Many of those arrested at the time were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences after being sentenced for \"treason\".According to pressure group Foro Penal, there are more than 800 political prisoners being held in Venezuela as of 5 January.",

Some voiced support for the decision saying they would welcome similar actions in the future, while others remained sceptical.Federal prosecutors, in their charging document, allege Maduro, his wife and son and their accomplices engaged in a cocaine-trafficking conspiracy and partnered with cartels designated as terrorist groups.Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.",

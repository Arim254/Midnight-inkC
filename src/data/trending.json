    "body": "The difficult question of what it would take to stop Putin fighting in Ukraine8 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also huge dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "8 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-depreciating,\" Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoEmily AtkinsonWatch: Eyewitness captures moment man tackles and disarms Bondi shooterA \"hero\" bystander who was filmed wrestling a gun from one of the Bondi Beach attackers has been named as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed.Video verified by the BBC showed Mr Ahmed run at the gunman and seize his weapon, before turning the gun round on him, forcing his retreat. Mr Ahmed, a fruit shop owner and father of two, remains in hospital, where he has undergone surgery for bullet wounds to his arm and hand, his family told 7News Australia.Fifteen people died and dozens were injured in the shooting on Sunday night, which took place as more than 1,000 people attended an event to celebrate Hanukkah. Police have declared it a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community.Mr Ahmed's cousin, Mustafa, told 7News Australia late on Sunday:  \"He is a hero, 100% he is a hero. He has two shots, one in his arm and one in his hand.\"In an update early on Monday, Mustafa said: \"I hope he will be fine. I saw him last night. He was alright but we're waiting to see what the doctor (says).\"His parents told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that he had been shot four or five times.\"We pray that God saves him,\" his mother said.His father added: \"When he did what he did, he wasn't thinking about the background of the people he's saving, the people dying in the street.\"He doesn't discriminate between one nationality and another. Especially here in Australia, there's no difference between one citizen and another.\"They said they had been separated from their son since 2006 when he came to Australia. They had travelled to Sydney from Syria a couple of months ago.Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They confirmed that the 50-year-old man died at the scene while the 24-year-old remains in hospital in critical condition.The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention has been shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of sight.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker, whom he tackles.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It is unclear who or what they are aiming at.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle At a news conference late on Sunday, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns paid tribute to the bravery of Mr Ahmed, who was unnamed at the time.\"That man is a genuine hero, and I've got no doubt there are many, many people alive tonight as a result of his bravery.\"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said.

    "body": "33 minutes agoPeter HoskinsBusiness reporterThe US firm behind the Roomba smart vacuum cleaner, iRobot, has filed for bankruptcy protection after facing competition from Chinese rivals and being hit by tariffs.Under the so-called pre-packaged Chapter 11 process, the main manufacturer of its devices, Shenzhen-based Picea Robotics, will take ownership of the firm.The tough commercial landscape had forced iRobot to cut its prices and make major investments in new technology, according to documents filed on Sunday.US import duties of 46% on goods from Vietnam, where most of iRobot's devices for the American market are made, increased its costs by $23m (£17.2m) this year, the firm said.The loss-making company was valued at $3.56bn in 2021 after the pandemic helped to drive strong demand for its products. It is now valued at around $140m.On Friday, iRobot's shares fell by more than 13% on the technology-heavy Nasdaq trading platform in New York.iRobot said the bankruptcy filing was not expected to disrupt its app, supply chains or product support.Founded in 1990 by three members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Artificial Intelligence Lab, iRobot initially focused on defence and space technology before launching the Roomba in 2002.The Roomba holds about 42% of the US market share and 65% of the Japanese market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company.Last year, a planned $1.7bn takeover deal by online retail giant Amazon was derailed by the European Union's competition watchdog.Trade tariffs imposed by US Donald Trump on goods entering America from overseas has added to costs to many businesses, including iRobot, which rely on imports for product manufacturing. Trump has argued that the import taxes will boost American jobs and industry. Picea is a manufacturer of robotic vacuum cleaners, with research and development and production facilities in China and Vietnam.It has more than 7,000 employees worldwide and has sold more than 20 million robotic vacuum cleaners.",

Victory meant the Lionesses became the first senior England football team to win a major trophy on foreign soil. They did it the hard way - conceding first in all three of their knockout matches and becoming the only side in Euros history to have three different matches go to extra time.But their never-say-die attitude, and some dramatic interventions by substitutes, helped Sarina Wiegman's squad become only the second country to retain a Euros title.England women's rugby union team (Red Roses)Image source, BBC SportEngland won the Women's Rugby World Cup in scintillating fashion in September, beating Canada 33-13 in front of a world record crowd of 81,885 at Twickenham. It was the first time the Red Roses had lifted the trophy since 2014. In their quarter-final victory over Scotland, they broke their own world record for the longest unbeaten run by an international rugby union side, and extended it to 33 without a loss in the final. Their last defeat came in the 2022 World Cup final. Earlier in 2025, they won a fourth consecutive Six Nations Grand Slam and a seventh consecutive title.European Ryder Cup teamImage source, BBC SportEurope held off a thrilling American resurgence to claim a Ryder Cup on US soil for only the fifth time, and the first since their legendary 'Miracle of Medinah' triumph in 2012.Luke Donald's side shrugged off a hostile New York crowd at Bethpage Black to open up a record seven-point lead after two days, having dominated the foursomes and fourballs formats.They had to show nerve to survive a remarkable United States comeback on the final day, but secured a 15-13 win to make it back-to-back victories. The Europeans have now triumphed in six of the past eight Ryder Cups.Media caption, How to vote for SPOTY 2025",

    "body": "'Everyone says it'll never be me' - Brown University student on surviving two mass shootings11 hours agoNada TawfikandPratiksha Ghildial,in Providence, Rhode IslandBrown student speaks to BBC after surviving second school shootingWith the holiday break just around the corner, 21-year-old Mia Tretta was in her dorm with a friend studying for their final exams.Just like other students at Brown University, she was distraught after receiving an active shooter alert from the university's department of public safety.But the difference for her is she has lived through this once before.Mia was shot in the 2019 mass shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California. She told the BBC it shattered her sense of safety and innocence.\"Everyone always tells themselves it'll never be me,\" she said. Mia TrettaMia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering after the 2019 shootingA 16-year-old boy shot her in the stomach and four others; two of them died including her best friend.A junior in high school at the time, Mia spent more than a week in the hospital recovering. She still has bullet fragments in her stomach, and has had multiple surgeries for nerve pain and to fix a hole in her eardrum.Attending Brown University, on the other side of the country, in Rhode Island, was meant to get her far away from what happened, in order to feel safe again. She told herself at least it wouldn't happen again, until it did.\"Gun violence doesn't care if you've already been shot before, and it doesn't care what community you're in,\" she said.\"It's an epidemic that touches every single community.\"Mia now feels a mixture of fear, confusion and anger. Americans, she says, shouldn't accept mass shootings as a fact of life.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMia spoke about gun violence during a visit to the White House in 2022Her generation has grown up practising active shooter drills in schools, and she is not the only student at Brown University who has now lived through their second school shooting.At a press conference on Sunday, the mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, was asked what could be done to stop the \"uniquely American experience\" of mass shootings on campuses. He was reluctant to weigh in with the investigation ongoing and the victims still recovering, but he shared a conversation he had had with one of the injured students. \"When I was at the hospital today - one of students that showed tremendous courage literally said to me, 'you know that active shooter drill they made me do in high school it actually helped me in the moment',\" he said.\"Which at the same time provided me hope, and was so sad. They shouldn't have to do active shooter drills but it helped, and the reason it helped and the reason we do these drills is because it's so damn frequent.\"Driving around campus, there is still a heavy police presence even though the lockdown has been lifted. One student, who was leaving for the holidays, said: \"Our perfect bubble, that we've been in for so long, just shattered.\"",

This is what we know about those identified so far: Matilda, 10Authorities confirmed that a 10-year-old girl, named by her family to local media as Matilda, was among the dead.

He was head of the local Chabad mission, an international Hasidic Jewish organisation based in Brooklyn.The death of the British-born father of five was confirmed by his cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis. \"My dear cousin, Rabbi Eli Schlanger @bondirabbi was murdered in today's terrorist attack in Sydney,\" Zalman wrote on Instagram. \"He leaves behind his wife & young children, as well as my uncle & aunt & siblings … He was truly an incredible guy\".In a post on its website, Chabad said Schlanger's youngest child was just two months old.\"He was the most godly, humane, kind, gracious human being I think I've ever met,\" Alex Ryvchin of the Executive Council of Australia Jewry, told reporters at Bondi on Monday morning. Dan ElkayamThe death of French national Dan Elkayam was confirmed by Frances's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot. \"It's with immense sadness that we have learnt that our compatriot Dan Elkayam was among the victims of the terrorist attack that hit Jewish families gathered on the beach at Bondi in Sydney,\" he wrote on social media. \"We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the Jewish community and the Australian people.\" According to his LinkedIn profile, Elkayam worked as an IT analyst for NBCUniversal and had moved to Australia last year.He was also a keen footballer, and \"an integral member\" of our premier league squad, the Rockdale Ilindin Football Club in west Sydney wrote on its Facebook page. He was \"an extremely talented and popular figure amongst team mates. Our deepest and sincerest condolances to Dan's family, friends and all that knew him. He will be missed,\" the club wrote. Alexander KleytmanAlexander Kleytman was a holocaust survivor who came to Australia from Ukraine. \"I have no husband. I don't know where is his body. Nobody can give me any answer,\" his wife Larisa Kleytman told reporters outside a Sydney hospital late on Sunday.\"We were standing and suddenly came the 'boom boom', and everybody fell down. At this moment he was behind me and at one moment he decided to go close to me. He pushed his body up because he wanted to stay near me,\" she told the Australian.Chabad wrote on X that Alexander \"died shielding her from the gunman's bullets. In addition to his wife, he leaves behind two children and 11 grandchildren.\"The couple shared some of their life story with Jewish Care in 2023.\"As children, both Larisa and Alexander faced the unspeakable terror of the Holocaust,\" the health organisation wrote in its annual report.\"Alex's memories are particularly harrowing; recalling the dreadful conditions in Siberia where he, along with his mother and younger brother, struggled for survival.\"How Bondi Beach shooting unfolded minute by minutePeter MeagherFormer police officer Peter Meagher was working as a freelance photographer at the Hanukkah event when he was killed, his rugby club confirmed. \"For him it was simply a catastrophic case of being in the wrong place and at the wrong time,\" Mark Harrison, the general manager of Randwick Rugby Club, wrote on its website.\"'Marzo, as he was universally known, was a much loved figure and absolute legend in our club, with decades of voluntary involvement, he was one of the heart and soul figures of Randwick Rugby.\"The club said he had spent almost four decades in the NSW Police Force where he was \"hugely respected by colleagues\".\"The tragic irony is that he spent so long in the dangerous front line as a Police Officer and was struck down in retirement while taking photos in his passion role is really hard to comprehend,\" the club said.Reuven MorrisonReuven Morrison migrated to Australia from the former Soviet Union in the 1970s as a teenager, according to an interview he gave to the ABC exactly a year ago.\"We came here with the view that Australia is the safest country in the world and the Jews would not be faced with such anti-Semitism in the future, where we can bring up our kids in a safe environment,\" he told the national broadcaster.Confirming his death, Chabad said that he was a longtime resident of Melbourne, but that he \"discovered his Jewish identity in Sydney\".\"A successful businessman whose main goal was to give away his earnings to charities dear to his heart, notably Chabad of Bondi,\" the organisation wrote on X.Rabbi Yaakov LevitanRabbi Yaakov Levitan's death was confirmed by Chabad, who described him as a \"popular coordinator\" of its activities in Sydney.He also served as secretary of the Sydney Beth Din – a rabbinical court – and worked at the BINA Center, which describes itself as a centre of Jewish learning.Tibor WeitzenTibor Weitzen was at the event with his wife and grandchildren when he was killed trying to shield a family friend, Chabad said.The 78-year-old was a \"beloved\" member of the Bondi Chabad Synagogue, according to the organisation.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJonny Humphries,North WestandPhil McCann,North WestBBCJames Vernon said he picked himself up off the ground and rushed to the aid of the injured A paramedic \"sent flying\" by a two-tonne car as it ploughed into a dense crowd at Liverpool's Premier League victory parade has described how the \"adrenaline took over\".James Vernon did not even hear the Ford Galaxy Titanium, driven by 54-year-old Paul Doyle, coming before he was struck from behind on 26 May.Mr Vernon, deployed as a cycle paramedic with the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) during the parade, was on his way to help a patient having a heart attack when he was struck. Despite being knocked down, he was able to shelter children in the back of an ambulance and rush to the aid of many of Doyle's 134 victims. 'Almighty force'Doyle, of Burghill Road in Croxteth, Liverpool, is due to be sentenced on Monday after pleading guilty to 31 charges including causing GBH with intent, dangerous driving and affray. Mr Vernon had been walking with his bicycle ahead of an ambulance to help it get to where the man had collapsed outside Hooters bar on Water Street, which was packed with tens of thousands of people. He said: \"There was a lot of people singing, a lot of people chanting, and I had the sirens at the back of me in close proximity, so very, very loud. \"I would say we were making good progress, and then all of a sudden I was struck with almighty force from behind, which has sent me flying over to the right-hand side.\"CPSPaul Doyle pleaded guilty to 31 charges including causing GBH with intent on what was supposed to be the first day of his trial Mr Vernon said he landed in a gutter and saw the car passing to his left. \"For me, instantly I thought I was in the middle of a terrorist incident,\" he said. After Doyle passed the ambulance, he stopped and reversed straight into it, before richocheting back into the middle of the road. He said it then lurched forward in a \"sweeping\" motion \"throwing members of the public left and right.\"Mr Vernon activated the emergency function on his radio and shouted that he and other pedestrians had been \"run over\" on Water Street. He and his colleague jumped in the back of the ambulance to take a \"10 second breather\" before deciding they needed to join the rescue effort. \"We both looked at each other and said 'we need to help here, let's get out, and let's do our jobs',\" Mr Vernon said. Footage of the incident was circulated on social mediaDescribing the scene as they opened the door, he said: \"There were patients lying on the floor, there were push-chairs on their sides, scarves on the floor, empty beer bottles, there was just everything all over the floor. \"There were piercing screams and people running in any direction you can imagine but just not towards the car.\"Fearing that a terrorist could still emerge from the vehicle, the paramedics ushered six or seven children into the back of the ambulance. \"I wasn't sure what the incident was outside,\" he said. \"I knew there was a car. I knew the car ran over a significant amount of people, but I didn't know what was then coming.\"Stopping at the \"twisted\" frame of his bike to grab some medical supplies, Mr Vernon began triaging the stricken fans in the road, including some still trapped under the Ford Galaxy. EPAPaul Doyle's car ploughed into a dense crowd on Water Street just after 18:00He said his while \"extensive\" training, including in mass casuality events, kicked in, he had never before been caught up in the same incident he was responding to. \"The adrenaline massively took over,\" he said.\"I'm going to be honest, the next day I woke up very stiff, you know, and that's very suggestive of that force, that whiplash kind of force.\"Mr Vernon said after more medics and police officers arrived on scene he was able to go into a makeshift casualty area in the Mowgli restaurant, where he was able to message his family and friends to tell them he was ok. Asked his reaction to Doyle's guilty pleas, he said: \"I think the relief was immeasurable. \"It was like a weight had lifted off my shoulders because I knew that then negated me from having to go to Crown Court [as a witness], and having to go through that process, and ultimately it's him admitting his guilt for what happened that day.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.More on this storyRelated links",

    "body": "Pro-democracy Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai found guilty of colluding with foreign forces17 minutes agoKelly Ng,Koey Lee,Hong KongandDanny Vincent,Hong KongWatch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner and media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been found guilty of colluding with foreign forces under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).The 78-year-old, who has been in jail since December 2020, pleaded not guilty. He faces life in prison and is expected to be sentenced early next year. Lai used his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper as part of a wider effort to lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China, the court found.Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee welcomed the verdict, noting that Lai's actions \"damaged the country's interests and the welfare of Hong Kongers\", but rights groups called it \"a cruel judicial farce\".They say the NSL, which Beijing defends as essential for the city's stability, has been used to crush dissent.Delivering the verdict on Monday,  Judge Esther Toh said there is \"no doubt\" that Jimmy Lai \"harboured hatred\" for the People's Republic of China (PRC), citing his \"constant invitation to the US to help bring down the government of the PRC with the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong\".When Lai testified in November, he denied all the charges against him, saying he had \"never\" used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong.Getty ImagesLai at a protest in 2019 when huge pro-democracy demonstrations rocked Hong Kong   Asked about his meeting with then US Vice President Mike Pence, Lai said he did not ask anything of him: \"I would just relay to him what happened in Hong Kong when he asked me.\"He was also asked about his meeting with then secretary of state Mike Pompeo, to which he said he had asked Pompeo, \"not to do something but to say something, to voice support for Hong Kong\".Lai, a UK citizen and one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state, was a key figure in the pro-democracy protests that engulfed Hong Kong in 2019. Beijing responded to the months-long demonstrations, which sometimes erupted into violent clashes with police, by introducing the NSL. The law was enacted without consulting the Hong Kong legislature and gave authorities broad powers to charge and jail people they deemed a threat to the city's law and order, or the government's stability.    Lai was accused of violating the NSL for his role in the protests and also through his tabloid Apple Daily, which became a standard bearer for the pro-democracy movement.Monday's ruling also found Lai guilty of publishing seditious material on Apple Daily under a separate colonial-era law.Lai appeared calm as the verdict was read out and waved goodbye to his family as he was escorted out of the courtroom. Lai's wife Teresa and one of his sons were in court, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, a long-time friend who baptised Lai in 1997.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai's wife, Teresa, their son Shun Yan and Cardinal Joseph Zen arrive at court\"Mr Lai's spirit is okay,\" his lawyer Robert Pang said after the verdict. \"The judgement is so long that we'll need some time to study it first. I don't have anything to add at the moment.\" He did not say whether they would appeal.The UK condemned what it described as \"politically motivated persecution\" of Lai, saying he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said in a statement on Monday.\"The Chinese government abused Jimmy Lai with the aim of silencing all those who dare to criticise the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],\" said Elaine Pearson, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, following the verdict.\"In the face of the farce of Jimmy Lai's case, governments should pressure the authorities to withdraw the case and release him immediately.\" Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to \"do everything to save\" Lai while UK PM Keir Starmer had said securing his release was a \"priority\". A test of judicial independenceLai's trial came to be widely seen as yet another test of judicial independence for Hong Kong's courts, which have been accused of toeing Beijing's line since 2019, when it tightened its control over the city. Hong Kong authorities insist the rule of law is intact but critics point to the hundreds of protesters and activists who have been jailed under the NSL - and its nearly 100% conviction rate as of May this year.Bail is also often denied in NSL cases and that was the case with Lai too, despite rights groups and Lai's children raising concerns about his deteriorating health. He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement. Lai's son Sebastien told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\" - \"Given his age, given his health... he will die in prison.\"The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission. They said it was a national security risk, although foreign lawyers had operated in the city's courts for decades. Subsequently Lai was denied his choice of lawyer, who was based in the UK.Watch: Jimmy Lai's son speaks to the BBC about China-UK relationsLai now joins dozens of figures of the city's pro-democracy movement who have been sentenced to prison under the NSL.The chief of Hong Kong's national security police addressed the media after the verdict, saying Lai had \"fabricated news\" in pursuit of \"political goals\". On the mainland, state-run Global Times quoted a Hong Kong election committee member as saying that the case sends a \"clear message\": \"Any attempt to split the country or undermine Hong Kong's prosperity and stability will be met with severe punishment under the law.\"From tycoon to activistLai, who was born in mainland China, fled to Hong Kong when he was 12 years old and got his footing as a businessman after founding the international clothing brand Giordano. His journey as a democracy activist began after China brutally crushed pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.Lai started writing columns criticising the massacre and went on to launch a string of popular pro-democracy publications, including Apple Daily and Next.Even now, many Hong Kongers see him as a leading voice for democracy - about 80 people had queued to enter the court ahead of the verdict on Monday. One of them was Ms Lam who didn't want to share her full name. An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. \"We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes,\" a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC.\"Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom.\"In his testimony, Lai had said that he had \"never allowed\" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a \"conspiracy\" and \"too crazy to think about\".\"The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,\" he had said. These values, he added, include the \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinandLeyla KhodabakhshiAFP via Getty ImagesSanam, an Iranian immigrant who came to the US over a decade ago, was finally about to become a US citizen. Years of navigating paperwork, approvals, tests, and security vetting, had brought her to the last step: a naturalization ceremony.But then, just two days before she was to take her oath on 3 December, the US government abruptly cancelled it.Sanam was shocked and confused at first – there was no explanation. She didn't understand why the ceremony was cancelled when she hadn't done anything wrong, she told the BBC.Later, she found out it was because of where she was born, and sadness and frustration crept in.\"It's been just years and just feeling drained and feeling like, can I even keep going with this process? Because it's been so hard,\" Sanam said. \"It's just very heartbreaking.\"Getty ImagesSanam - who wishes to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation but who chose to share her nickname - lives in Oregon with her husband, a US citizen from Kansas. Her identity has been verified by the BBC.Her case is one of many – earlier this month the Trump administration began cancelling the citizenship ceremonies of immigrants from 19 countries already subject to a travel ban, including Iran.That controversial decision left some legal permanent residents like Sanam – people who already had passed through every step of the process to become US citizens and were only awaiting the final formality – in an indefinite state of uncertainty.\"It just feels like our life is kind of in this limbo state, unstable,\" Sanam said, adding that she and her husband feel like they are \"at the mercy of what the government decides\".This experience has led Sanam to start reconsidering whether it's worth it to stay in the US. She still has family in Iran, including her aging parents, and she doesn't know when she'll be able to see them again.\"It's hard to think about hope at this point,\" she said. \"It's a really scary time and unfortunately as we approach the holidays, it's just really sad that people are going through this, and it's supposed to be a season of joy and getting together with your family.\"19 countries affected by travel banThe cancelling of oath ceremonies is just one part of the Trump administration's latest efforts to tighten immigration rules. Migrants from the 19 countries already subject to a travel ban have had their immigration processing halted no matter where they are in the process, not just those at the final step.The move, and others like it, came in the days after an Afghan national opened fire on National Guard members in Washington DC on 26 November, killing one and critically injuring another. The Trump administration has used the shooting as justification for a number of new efforts to tamp down immigration, including sending an additional 500 National Guard troops to DC, reducing the work visa validity period from five years to 18 months, and pausing all asylum claim decisions.US Citizenship and Immigration Services has said the restrictions are necessary to safeguard national security, protect American lives, and ensure public safety.But Mario Bruzzone, vice president of policy at the New York Immigration Coalition, a nonprofit that represents hundreds of immigrant rights groups, said the restrictions put immigrants who are in need of protection in dangerous situations.\"An indefinite pause is a ban, plain and simple, and they're using the recent shooting in DC as a pretext for an escalation in attacks on immigrants and refugees,\" Mr Bruzzone told the BBC.One Venezuelan immigrant, Jorge, was also on the cusp of becoming a US citizen when suddenly, less than 24 hours before his ceremony on 2 December, he was told it had been cancelled without explanation.\"I had everything prepared, including attending the ceremony with my son. To have it cancelled the day before, without any clear reason, left us with no clarity about the next steps,\" Jorge said.Jorge, which is not his real name, has asked to remain anonymous, but his identity and experience have been verified by the BBC. He said he obtained permanent residency in 2017 through the \"extraordinary ability\" category, which is reserved for professionals at the top of their field.Jorge agrees with the Trump administration that there should be \"stricter reviews\" of immigrants, he told the BBC. He blames the Biden administration for allowing too many immigrants into the country, and added that if he had been able to vote, he would have supported President Donald Trump.What concerns him, he said, is that long-term residents with no criminal history are now being \"generalised\" alongside people who he believes do require deeper scrutiny.\"I just want those of us who have followed every rule to be able to move forward with our cases — and for those who have committed fraud or crimes to face the appropriate legal consequences,\" Jorge said.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Trump has expanded his previous travel ban to include 19 countries, mostly from Muslim-majority or African countriesMr Bruzzone of the NYIC said many immigrants from the 19 countries - including refugees, asylum seekers, and legal permanent residents like Sanam and Jorge - have already gone through extensive vetting that takes years and has multiple layers of security checks and health checks.Living in New York state alone, there were an estimated 132,000 Venezuelan-born people in 2023, according to data gathered by the New York Immigration Coalition.The halt has disrupted the lives of people at every stage of the immigration process, leaving them to wait it out in a \"huge amount of uncertainty\", Mr Bruzzone said.Sanam's husband, who chose not to share his name for fear of retaliation, told the BBC that the timeline of events feels astounding.\"If those National Guard members weren't attacked last week, but this week, [my wife] would be a citizen right now,\" he told the BBC the day after Sanam's oath ceremony was supposed to happen.\"Your mind goes a little bit wild about how quick the mechanism for changing all of these policies came on,\" he said. \"It just feels like the administration clearly didn't let a good crisis go to waste in this case. And it's pretty tough to be underneath that.\"",

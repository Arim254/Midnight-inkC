This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "3 days agoJasmine SandharBBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesIt will be the first time the US singer will lead a major studio movieSabrina Carpenter looks set to swap her signature Espresso for tea - with the Mad Hatter. The US pop star is going back to her acting roots with plans to star in and produce a musical movie inspired by Alice in Wonderland, BBC Newsbeat understands. The unnamed project is being made for Universal Pictures and will be written and directed by US filmmaker Lorene Scafaria.It's not clear who Carpenter will play in the adaptation or when it will go into production.A 'Busy Woman'If it goes ahead, it will be Carpenter's first time leading a major studio film.The 26-year-old singer approached Universal last year with ideas for it, according to US media outlets. As the wonderland became more of a reality, Scafaria reportedly decided to join the madness.Writer and director Scafaria is best known for her work on Hustlers, a 2019 film fronted by Jennifer Lopez about a crew of strippers in New York City. Carpenter has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year prize for her seventh album, Man's Best Friend. She is currently on the last leg of her Short n' Sweet Tour, which included two headline shows at London's BST Festival this summer. The upcoming film will not be the first time she's gone down the rabbit hole of acting. Getty ImagesCarpenter began her acting career on Disney Channel, playing Maya Hart in the TV series Girl Meets WorldCarpenter started out as a child actor on Disney Channel playing a recurring role as Maya Hart on the comedy series Girl Meets World.Since then, she's appeared in Netflix films Work It and Tall Girl, as well as 20th Century Fox's The Hate U Give.More recently, she's been announced as a \"guest star\" in a one-off Muppet Show special for Disney+, which will premiere in 2026.Previous Alice in Wonderland versions include the 1951 animated movie by Disney and Tim Burton's 2010 take with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. The story comes from Victorian author Lewis Carroll, who first published Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a children's novel in 1865.It tells the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a fantasy world of talking animals and creatures.

    "body": "14 minutes agoHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood tells the Sunday Times she will end the UK's \"golden ticket\" asylum rules by increasing the period of time after which a refugee can claim settled status from five to 10 years. A shorter waiting period for people who arrive legally will also be confirmed by the government when it sets out its asylum plans later this week, the paper says. Illegal migration, Mahmoods adds, is \"tearing us apart\". Former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner has spoken to the Daily Mirror, calling this week's leadership challenge talk in the Labour Party \"arrogant tittle tattle\". The paper says it is her first interview since resigning after admitting not paying the right tax on her home.But elsewhere, the Sunday Telegraph claims Rayner is preparing for a leadership election herself by shoring up support among Labour MPs. A source close to the Greater Manchester MP told the paper its report was \"total rubbish\". The Observer's front page asks if there is \"political interference\" at the BBC, after a turbulent week which saw its its director-general and head of news resign. The newspaper has previously published an editorial describing the events leading up to their departure as a \"political attack\".The Daily Mail's front page focuses on upcoming BBC lectures given by Rutger Bregman, who the paper says has been critical of Donald Trump in the past. The author, who is best known for his books Utopia For Realists and Humankind: A Hopeful History, is due to give four BBC lectures, one of which will be titled A Time Of Monsters.The Daily Express leads on calls from the Conservatives, Reform and some industry figures for the government to reduce taxes on high street businesses, particularly pubs. Claims of an impending \"bloodbath\" in the main headline on Sunday's front page come from shadow chancellor Mel Stride.The Sunday People leads on an update about Edward Putman, who made national headlines when he claimed a lottery win using a fake ticket. Edward Putman, who was jailed in 2019 for the con, has previously also been convicted of rape and benefit fraud.Model Kelly Brook speaks to the Daily Star as she enters the jungle for the latest series of I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here. The paper says she is \"defying cruel taunts about her figure\", and quotes her as saying: \"I embrace my curves, I embrace my body.\"Finally, the Sun pictures British actor Sacha Baron Cohen outside a nightclub with a female companion on its front page. The Ali G and Borat actor was spotted in Hollywood. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Nine people were injured, one critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Police said ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while the critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was underway, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote on Facebook.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 4 days agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to \"overhaul\" state-owned energy companies, after a major corruption scandal engulfed the country's energy sector.Around $100 million (£76m) has been embezzled, anti-graft investigators said, causing outrage in a country where Russian attacks have resulted in crippling power outages.\"Alongside a full audit of their financial activities, the management of these companies is to be renewed,\" Zelensky wrote in a post on X on Saturday. Energoatom, the state nuclear company at the heart of the scandal, will have a new supervisory board \"within a week,\" he added. Several of those implicated in the scandal have close links to the Ukrainian president.The scandal is unfolding against the backdrop of escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities, including substations that supply electricity to nuclear power plants.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" Zelensky wrote. He also called for the quick appointment of a new head of Ukrhydroenergo, a hydropower generating company, and reforms for oil and gas giant Naftogaz and the nation's Gas Transmission System Operator. Two ministers were forced to resign over the corruption scheme and a former business partner of Zelensky was sanctioned earlier this week when the scandal broke.On Monday, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) said the 15 month-long investigation had revealed several members of the Ukrainian government were involved.Some of those implicated in the scandal are or have been, close associates of Zelensky's. Among those alleged to be involved are Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko, former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and Timur Mindich - a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95.Zelensky has previously said he is committed to fully cooperate with the anti-corruption investigation.\"I have also instructed government officials to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies,\" he said on Saturday.\"The full transparency and integrity in the energy sector remain an absolute priority.\"But the scandal has brought Zelensky's commitment to fighting corruption under scrutiny once again. In July, he faced backlash after he signed a law limiting the independence of Nabu and Sap. The outrage was only quelled by Zelensky's decision to reinstate their freedom, but the debacle prompted criticism from European allies including France and Germany, while ambassadors from the G7 group of nations expressed the desire to discuss the issue with the Ukrainian leadership.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlison Roberts,Lisbon and Ian Aikman,LondonAn 85-year-old British woman has died after an extreme wind storm struck a campsite in Portugal.Two others were seriously injured and three sustained minor injuries at Albufeira Camping Park in the Algarve, Faro's district commander for rescue operations told a press conference.At a nearby hotel, which was also hit by the storm late on Saturday morning, 23 people were slightly injured, he added.National meteorological office IPMA said it was assessing whether there had been a tornado in the area, with radar images indicating the likelihood was very high.It is difficult to predict when or where tornadoes might occur, the IPMA added.The storm hit the area around 11:00 GMT on Saturday and lasted until 15:00, it said. Video filmed at the campsite shows fallen trees, debris strewn across the ground and vehicles with broken windows.Among the 28 injured across both sites in Albufeira there are six children, aged between two months and seven years, who were all lightly injured, and 23 adults, aged between 24 and 70, Portugal's National Medical Emergency Institute said.The UK's Minister for Europe Stephen Doughty said the Foreign Office was monitoring the situation and would support any Britons caught in the storm.\"My deep condolences to the family of a British woman who died and those injured,\" he said in a post on X.Luis Montenegro, prime minister of Portugal, also expressed \"heartfelt condolences\" to the family of the woman who died, and wished a \"speedy recovery\" to the injured. Portugal's Civil Protection responded with \"full commitment and the greatest possible speed\", he wrote in a post on X, adding: \"Unfortunately, serious consequences could not be avoided.\"Portugal and parts of neighbouring Spain have been severely affected by Storm Claudia over the past two days. On Thursday, an elderly couple died in Lisbon after their home was flooded, rescuers said.Faro, Setúbal and Beja - also in southern Portugal - remain under an orange warning for persistent rain on Saturday, sometimes heavy and accompanied by thunderstorms, according to the IPMA website.",

    "body": "People granted asylum in the UK will have to wait 20 years before they can apply to settle permanently, under plans due to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday.The major shake-up to asylum policy comes as the government seeks to reduce small boat crossings and asylum claims.Under the plans, people who are granted asylum will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their refugee status regularly reviewed and those whose home countries are then deemed safe told to return.Currently refugee status lasts for five years, after which people can apply for indefinite leave to remain. Now the home secretary wants to cut the initial period from five years to two-and-a-half years, after which refugee status will be regularly reviewed.But she plans to significantly lengthen the time it will take to gain permanent residence in the UK from five years to 20.Mahmood told the Sunday Times the reforms were \"designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat\".She continued: \"Illegal migration is tearing our country apart\", adding that it was the government's job to \"unite our country\".\"If we don't sort this out, I think our country becomes much more divided,\" she told the newspaper.The policy has been copied from Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.In Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.And Mahmood's new approach will certainly face opposition from some Labour MPs.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said it was \"right the government looks at new ways to fix the disorderly asylum system created by the Conservatives\".He added that Labour \"shouldn't kid itself that these measures are an alternative to processing claims quickly so we can remove those with no right to be here\".Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, described the government's plans as \"harsh and unnecessary\", and said they \"won't deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilReutersMarching to the beat of pounding sound systems, thousands of climate protesters have been bringing their message to the gates of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Chanting and singing \"free the Amazon\", demonstrators in host city Belém have been carrying three giant coffins reading Oil, Coal and Gas flanked by two grim reapers.Indigenous groups displayed signs reading \"the answer is us\" as an inflatable elephant and anaconda weaved through the crowd under the hot sun.It is the first time since 2021 that protesters have been allowed to demonstrate outside the UN climate talks. The last three took place in countries that do not permit public protest.Prostesters played samba music and sang\"We are holding a funeral for fossil fuels,\" Tuga Cíntia told the BBC. She is from the theatre group Hydra Dance from the Federal University of Pará.\"I'm here because enough is enough with COP meetings and theory. It's time for us to actually act,\" she said.Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from across the world joined the march in their thousands.As the midday sun intensified, some sought shelter in a petrol station forecourt.\"Fossil fuels are still being burned. We know all too well what it's like to live on the frontline of climate change,\" Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from Samoa, a low-lying island extremely vulnerable to climate change, told the BBC.\"We are here after so many COPS, marching for justice, for the end of fossil fuels,\" Ilan, from the non-governmental organisation 350, who lives in Brazil, said.Brianna Fruean, a climate activist from SamoaSome carried signs reading \"demarcation now\", calling for indigenous groups to be given legal ownership of their territories. Hundreds of indigenous groups live in the Amazon and are regarded by experts as the best protectors of biodiversity and forests.Smaller sister protests have taken place around the world including in the UK.Security was tight at the COP30 venue as police with riot shields guarded the entrance.On Tuesday protesters carrying signs broke through security lines at the summit. The incident caused minor injuries to two security staff and some limited damage to the venue.Representation of indigenous voices has been a flashpoint in these talks, some of whom have set up stalls outside the fenced-off COP30 venue to sell products to passing delegates. The meeting was dubbed the \"indigenous people's COP\" but many groups feel their concerns over deforestation, land protection and resource extraction in their homes are not being heard.Negotiations continued at the COP30 talks on Saturday. Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change.Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels.President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon.But shortly before the talks opened last week, his government granted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.On Friday, analysis of attendee lists by the coalition Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) suggested a record number of delegates from fossil fuel companies are attending the meeting.A protester with sign reading \"the answer is us\"It suggests 1,600 lobbyists are in Belém, a 12% rise from the COP meeting last year.It is common for business leaders to come to the talks to strike deals. With the US strikingly absent from negotiations, progress has been slow. It is the first time the country has sent no delegation to the talks, after President Donald Trump branded climate change \"a con\".Earlier in the week a group of senior climate leaders wrote a letter calling on the summit to ensure the facts about climate change were \"upheld. Ten countries have signed an initiative called Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change at COP30, launched by the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change.It aims to create international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote evidence-based information on climate issues.On the core issues of how to tackle the root cause of climate change and how to help countries adapt to ongoing global warming, Brazil has promised the talks will deliver action to implement years of deals and pledges. The talks continue into next week.",

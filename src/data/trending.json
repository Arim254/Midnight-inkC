From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested. We assess the Democratic party’s chances of winning this traditional Republican seat.Programme WebsiteMore episodes",

    "body": "8 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and media editorShumeet Banerji is not a household name. In the three years, 10 months and 14 days that he spent on the BBC board, Banerji kept his thoughts on BBC matters firmly out of the public domain.Now he is making headlines. His resignation is the latest blow to the corporation, and it looks timed to add to the pressure.Banerji's role on the board was due to end on 31 December anyway but he has instead resigned early, three days before other board members are due to face a committee of MPs - and nearly two weeks after the BBC lost its director general and its CEO of news.The resignation, fairly or not, looks like a direct criticism of the BBC's chair Samir Shah.Banerji, according to an insider, was known to be angry that Shah was - in his view - weak in not challenging a number of other board members and their assertion about systemic bias at BBC News.In this characterisation, the four political appointees to the board - Shah is the fifth - have banded together around the view that the BBC too often suffers from liberal groupthink, and the chair has been unable, or unwilling, to steer his board to a place of real consensus.In the end, after all the drama of the past few weeks - the leaked memo, the resignations, the apology over the Panorama edit and the threat of a defamation suit by Donald Trump - it boils down to one simple question. Is BBC News institutionally biased?Deborah Turness and Tim Davie reject that. So does Shah. While acknowledging mistakes have been made, he told me \"the BBC News DNA and culture is to be impartial, to provide the best news we can and the most trustworthy news we can\".BBC News remains the most trusted source of news in the UK.But if some members of the board believe that the BBC does suffer from systemic bias, and others do not, where does this end?A senior TV executive told me Shah inherited \"a house divided but this board is melting down, it's very sad\". They added: \"It's a leadership issue.\"When I interviewed him after the resignations of Davie and Turness, Shah told me the board had \"a diversity of views, as there are in the public, as there are in the country itself… I want robust conversations, I want discussion\".But Banerji has now claimed he was not consulted over the events that led to those departures. If true, it will feed into the narrative advanced in some quarters that what has happened has been a coup by some members of the board. Sir Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, has called on the government to remove Sir Robbie Gibb, an ex-BBC executive and former Downing Street director of communications to Theresa May, from the board.Shah told me the notion of a coup was \"fanciful\". He added that \"it's unfair and it's disrespectful to the members of the board to say that because they feel strongly about something, that somehow it's to do with their history\".But Sir Craig Oliver, former editor of the BBC's Six o'clock and Ten o'clock News, who was later director of communications at Number 10 under David Cameron, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"the stakes were already high for Samir Shah and they just got even higher\".He added that \"all eyes are going to be on Samir Shah on Monday\". \"The questions I think he's going to really have to answer are, is it true that months ago you chaired a BBC meeting where the Panorama issue was on the table and you decided to take no action? And if so why - particularly after what you've now said - did you not take action then?\"And I think that the next question that he's really going to have face is, when Michael Prescott's report was leaked to the Telegraph, why did you preside over such a long time of the BBC not coming out, particularly when the executive wanted to get out and cauterize the issue as cleanly as possible?\"In the last few days, prior to Banerji's resignation, I spoke to insiders at the BBC as well as people outside, who told me that Shah will remain as chair, whatever his perceived shortcomings. As one person put it to me, \"you can't have the DG, the CEO of News and the chair all resign\".Does Banerji's resignation shift the dial on his ability to continue in the role? It certainly makes Shah's appearance along with fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson in front of the Culture Media and Sport Committee on Monday even more critical.MPs on that committee voiced their reservations about whether he was qualified for the job when he was appointed as chair last year. He will need to demonstrate to those MPs, the industry, BBC audiences and staff at the corporation who will be watching, that he has the capabilities and support needed to steer the BBC through these turbulent times.",

It shows me also our shared humanity, how alike we are in so, so many ways. \"And no matter where we come from, in that theatre, we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together, we dream together. And that is the power of this art form. \"And that is why it matters, that is why it matters to me. So making films is not what I do, it is who I am.\"Cruise made his film debut in 1981 and was previously nominated for best actor for Born on the Fourth of July and Jerry Maguire. He was also nominated as best supporting actor in the film Magnolia and for producing Top Gun: Maverick.The Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences selected Cruise for his \"incredible commitment to our film-making community, to the theatrical experience, and to the stunts community\", the organisation said.The Risky Business actor told the ceremony that cinema made the world much larger than the one that he knew as a child. \"It opened my eyes. It opened my imagination to the possibility that life could expand far beyond the boundaries that I then perceived in my own life. And that beam of light opened a desire to open the world, and I have been following it ever since.\"The actor, who famously performs his own stunts, has also been a fervent advocate for cinema as the streaming industry and social media compete for viewers' time and attention.\"I want you to know that I will always do everything I can to help this art form, to support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful - hopefully without too many more broken bones.\"Notably, earlier this year Cruise was reportedly set to be recognised by US President Donald Trump when he announced his picks for this year's Kennedy Center honours but the actor declined due to scheduling conflicts.",

    "body": "18 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesEvery winter, the search for the secret to staying well seems to intensify. Supermarket shelves fill with \"immune-boosting\" shots, cold water swimming groups grow and social media becomes crowded with tips on how to fend off seasonal bugs. But with so many remedies promising to keep colds and flu at bay, how much of it actually works and is it even possible to boost your immune system in the first place?Cold water swimming: A buzz, not a boostGetty ImagesCold water swimming has surged in popularity, with some enthusiasts convinced it keeps winter illnesses at bay.Immunologist professor Eleanor Riley tells BBC Radio 4's Inside Health podcast that the post-swim \"high\" is real, but it's driven by adrenaline and endorphins.\"If you take a blood sample before and after a cold swim, white blood cell levels do rise,\" she explains. \"But that's because the body thinks an infection might be coming, so cells move into the bloodstream. \"Within hours the levels go back to normal so your body hasn't created any more white blood cells.\" Professor Riley adds that part of the benefit of cold water swimming comes from building a social connection. Feeling \"brighter, more alert and more connected\" has real physiological effects.Professor John Tregoning, a vaccine immunologist, says the benefits are mostly indirect and much of what makes people feel healthier in winter may come down to stress.\"It reduces stress because you're outdoors with nice people in nice places. But you could get the same from dancing, singing or going for a run.\"Being in nature can lower your blood pressure and stress hormones that can dampen immune responses. GP Dr Margaret McCartney explains that moderate exercise does show evidence of reducing viral infections, but that could be any form of exercise, not just cold water swimming. Kombucha: Interesting but little evidenceGetty ImagesMany people turn to fermented drinks like kombucha which promises to boost the microbiome and, by extension, the immune system.But Dr McCartney remains cautious. \"There are lots of theories about why a diverse microbiome is good, but we don't have strong enough real-world evidence to recommend kombucha to patients.\"Professor Tregoning adds that while it's true that the microbiome changes during infections, it usually returns to its previous state afterwards.Dr McCartney says while drinks like kombucha present \"interesting ideas about the role of the microbiome\", there isn't a clear link with how it can help boost your immune system. Supplements: Just expensive urineGetty ImagesVitamin C has long been sold as a winter essential, but according to Dr McCartney, the evidence simply isn't strong enough to recommend it when it comes to fighting off colds. She says the same goes for multi-vitamins which do very little beyond giving you \"expensive urine\". However, Vitamin D is slightly different as \"there's theoretical evidence of a small decrease in respiratory infections\". But, she explains that not everyone will see a benefit if they take it and it's only people \"with low vitamin D and pre-existing respiratory diseases\" who will likely benefit. Many people in the UK remain deficient in Vitamin D and Professor Tregoning suggests that winter sunlight and getting outdoors can help. Vaccinations: The only boost that worksGetty ImagesThe likes of turmeric shots, ginger drinks and fancy nasal sprays do nothing to boost your immune system, according to Dr McCartney.Professor Tregoning says that a nasal spray can help with a blocked nose but all you need is a simple saline spray which is just salt and water. \"The solution can dilute the blocked nose, stimulate turnover of mucus and relieve inflammation.\" All three experts agree that ultimately only one intervention can strengthen the immune system and that's vaccination.Professor Riley recommends the flu jab which takes from seven to 10 days after the jab to take effect.While you can't boost your immune system in the dramatic way winter wellness trends often promise, the experts advise supporting it by avoiding smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, finding a regular sleep routine and doing any activity that helps reduce stress. Dr McCartney says you can also reduce your risk of colds by being in well ventilated spaces and washing your hands regularly and properly.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAlex Smith, Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, in Abuja, and Elettra NeysmithBBCSt Mary's School, in Niger state, was attacked in the early hours of Friday morningMore than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen.The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated.It said the figures have been revised upwards \"after a verification exercise\".The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".It was initially reported that 215 pupils had been taken - but that figure has since been revised upwards. The new number is believed to be almost half of the school's student population, the news agency AFP reports.Authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.They said in a statement the move exposed pupils and staff to \"avoidable risk\". The school has not commented on that claim.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs - but this has had little effect.Friday's mass abduction was the third such attack in the country in a week.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.A church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.The central government has ordered more than 40 federal colleges to close and public schools in some states have been shut.But the rising insecurity is fuelling anger as well as fear in Nigeria, with citizens demanding stronger action to protect children and communities.The mass abduction follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok 2014.The incident courted international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed - but as many as 100 still remain missing.",

    "body": "3 days agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsBBC\"It feels like I am constantly setting myself up for failure or disappointment,\" says AswanPerfectionism has a great reputation. It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag.For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard.But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back?\"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan.Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".It's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\".That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago.Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".Breaking the cycleWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system.Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment.It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time.Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.Over the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner criticFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat.\"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\"At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout.Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.\"Right now I have become content with just trying my best and accepting that I can't always get the outcome I want but the outcome I get will be more than good enough and I am at peace with that now.\"Not all perfectionism is necessarily harmful. One form, known as perfectionistic striving, focuses on setting more ambitious personal goals. When these goals can be adapted in response to changing circumstances, they tend to cause less stress and lead to more positive outcomes. For example, an athlete setting tough goals, but cutting back on training when they're injured.But it still has its limitations. A research paper published in July 2025 by the British Psychological Society found that aiming for excessively high goals often leads to long working hours, with only marginal gains in performance.Working through these perfectionistic tendencies can be uncomfortable, says Dr Windgassen - but that discomfort is part of the process.\"That's not a sign that you shouldn't do it - it's a sign that you should,\" she says.",

    "body": "8 hours agoHolly Wallis and Patrick JacksonGetty ImagesThe publisher of the Daily Mail has agreed to buy the Daily and Sunday Telegraph for £500m.The Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT) said it had entered a period of discussion with RedBird IMI, which is a joint venture between the United Arab Emirates and the US private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners. RedBird Capital's own bid for control of the Telegraph collapsed last week.The deal needs to be signed off by Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy.  A spokesperson said Nandy would \"review any new buyer acquiring the Telegraph in line with the public interest and foreign state influence media mergers regimes\".The Telegraph has been in limbo for over two years, when the RedBird IMI consortium paid off the debts of the Telegraph's previous owners, the Barclay family, hoping to take eventual ownership of the newspapers.Dame Caroline Dineage, chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committe, said she was \"keen to see a resolution to the uncertainty that's hampered the Telegraph for years\", while \"not understating the need for media plurality\".\"This situation has been unsustainable for the business and unsettling for staff so I hope the government set out its position early next week,\" she added.\"The Committee have largely stayed out of the discussion to date, because takeovers are quasi judicial in terms of the Government's role.\"DMGT and RedBird IMI have said they expect the deal to be finalised quickly.DMGT chairman Lord Rothermere said he had \"long admired the Daily Telegraph\" and the deal would give \"much-needed certainty and confidence\" to its employees.He said: \"The Daily Telegraph is Britain's largest and best quality broadsheet newspaper and I have grown up respecting it. It has a remarkable history and has played a vital role in shaping Britain's national debate over many decades.\"He added: \"Chris Evans is an excellent editor and we intend to give him the resources to invest in the newsroom. Under our ownership, the Daily Telegraph will become a global brand, just as the Daily Mail has.\"The purchase would see the Telegraph become part of DMGT's portfolio of media organisations, which includes the i Paper, Metro and New Scientist, along with the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday papers.The group said the Telegraph would remain editorially independent from DMGT's other titles.It said its case for having the deal approved was \"compelling\" and would comply with UK regulations, as there would be no foreign state investment or capital in the funding structure.A spokesman for RedBird IMI said: \"DMGT and RedBird IMI have worked swiftly to reach the agreement announced today, which will shortly be submitted to the secretary of state.\"Elsewhere, Chris Fox, Liberal Democrat Lords' spokesperson for business, said: \"A move towards a potential deal to end the uncertainty that has plagued the Telegraph's future should certainly be considered. \"But, of course as Liberals, we are sceptical about concentrating so much agenda-setting power in the hands of so few.\"He urged the competitions' regulator to \"rigorously examine\" the terms of the agreement to \"ensure we don't get an even more unbalanced media market for consumers and competitors\".RedBird Capital pulled out of a deal to buy the Telegraph last week.It had a previous attempt to buy the group rebuffed by politicians as it was majority-funded by Abu Dhabi's IMI group - which is owned in turn by the Abu Dhabi royal family.A law change meant that foreign sovereign wealth funds could take a maximum stake of 15% in newspapers or periodicals.Its more recent bid complied with that rule, but it was understood that the government intended to submit the deal to regulatory review.Sources close to RedBird insisted that they were confident that the bid would have passed a government review process, but cited negative articles toward the bid from the current Telegraph newsroom as a factor in shelving their interest.RedBird founder Gerry Cardinale had planned to expand the Telegraph's reach and subscriber base in the US, believing there to be a gap in the market.Among other investments, RedBird owns the Italian football team AC Milan.",

    "body": "Ukraine's allies from Europe, Canada and Japan have voiced concerns over a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, saying it \"will require additional work\".They said in a statement the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\", but cited concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army.Later on Saturday, US President Donald Trump said the draft plan was not his \"final offer\" for Ukraine. On Sunday, security officials from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine will meet in Geneva, Switzerland.President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept the plan seen as favourable to Moscow.Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.When asked on Saturday whether the current draft plan was his final offer for Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"No, not my final offer.\" \"One way or another we have to get it [the war] ended, so we're working on it,\" he added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be among those taking part in talks in Geneva on Sunday. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell will attend on the UK's behalf.Saturday's joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials were also among the signatories.The statement said: \"We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"It added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, spoke to Zelensky on the phone on Saturday, followed by a call with Trump.On the Trump call, a Downing Street spokesman said Sir Keir \"relayed the discussions that have been taking place between Coalition of the Willing partners [Ukraine's allies] in attendance at the G20 summit today\".They added: \"The leaders agreed their teams would work together on the 28-point US peace proposal in Geneva tomorrow. They agreed to speak again tomorrow.\"Sir Keir earlier said he was concerned about proposed caps on Ukraine's military in the US plan, saying \"it's fundamental that Ukraine has to be able to defend itself if there's a ceasefire\".The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.The plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\". \"Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\" Zelensky added, pledging to work \"constructively\" with the Americans on the plan.On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail. He added Moscow was willing to \"show flexibility\" - but was also prepared to fight on.Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in Ukraine's south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "8 hours agoPhilippa Roxby,Health reporter and Alison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesDetails of a new UK clinical trial to assess the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender have been announced.It follows the banning of the drugs for gender treatment last year after a major review raised concerns about the lack of clinical evidence over their safety for under-18s.Researchers from King's College London say the trial will involve around 220 children under the age of 16 who are going through puberty, and will examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing.Some clinicians and campaigners question whether the trial is ethical.Prof Emily Simonoff, study leader and professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King's College London (KCL), told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that young people and their parents attending services for gender distress \"tell us that they don't know what to do - they look at the information that's out there and they don't know what's best for them\".But she said the study was not expecting a \"one size fits all finding\".\"We are looking very much at the balance between, possibly, benefits for mental health and quality of life, and any possible risks or harms.\" She added this would include monitoring people's physical health, and would also be the first ever study looking at the impact on brain development. Puberty blockers, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening.They were used to treat some young people with gender incongruence - when someone's gender identity doesn't match the sex they were registered at birth - or with gender dysphoria, when it causes significant distress.As a result of the uncertainty over the safety of the drugs, highlighted by the Cass review into gender care, led by paediatrician Dr Hilary Cass, doctors can now only offer the treatment to under-18s as part of a research study.Last year, the government brought in a UK-wide indefinite ban on the drugs being prescribed privately or by the NHS to children and young people questioning their gender identity.The new clinical trial, called Pathway, will involve children who are currently accessing gender services and have a diagnosis of gender incongruence.They will all have reached puberty, but will be younger than 16 - and will have to meet strict criteria, undergo intensive medical and psychological screening before they are allowed to start taking puberty blockers.A team of specialist NHS doctors must have a full picture of the young person's wellbeing before deciding if they think they are suitable for the treatment.The young person will also have to show they have a good enough understanding of the potential impact of taking puberty blockers to give their consent, and their parent or legal guardian will need to agree. They will be provided with ongoing psychological support.To explore the impact of the drugs, the researchers plan to start one group on the treatment straight away and another group 12 months later. The children in these groups will be chosen randomly.The KCL researchers said there would be no minimum age for taking the drugs, but puberty normally starts around the age of 11 for girls and 12 for boys.The trial will look at issues such as bone density, brain development and mental health and wellbeing over time.The research team said the trial had been given ethical approval and was expected to start in January, with five to six children recruited every month. The first results should be available in around four years.Alongside this, a larger observational study involving 3,000 children will research different types of support and how effective they are.The puberty blockers trial has already proved controversial, with campaigners threatening legal action.Keira Bell, who took the Tavistock gender clinic to court in 2020 after she was given puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as a teenager, said the trial should be halted immediately. If it is not, she says she and another campaigner will start judicial review proceedings at the High Court.She said it was \"disgusting\" that children were being put on the drugs when they had already been banned because they were \"unsafe\".In her case, the High Court ruled that under-16s were \"unlikely to be able to give informed consent\" to puberty blockers, but this was later overturned by the Court of Appeal which ruled that doctors can judge whether young people can give consent to the treatment.Some clinicians from the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender, which campaigns for rigorous science and improved treatment options for gender-questioning people, have also questioned whether the trial can be carried out ethically. Study lead Prof Simonoff said: \"We know there are ongoing societal discussions about gender transition, but this research is focused solely on informing and improving healthcare by better understanding how to support the physical and mental health of young people with gender incongruence.\"Dr Hilary Cass said she was \"really pleased\" Prof Simonoff and the KCL team were undertaking the trial.She said: \"My review uncovered a very weak evidence base for benefits from the use of puberty blockers for children and young people with gender dysphoria. In fact, some children had more negative than positive effects.\"However, given that there are clinicians, children and families who believe passionately in the beneficial effects, a trial was the only way forward to make sense of this.\"She added: \"Although a lot of media attention has focused on the trial, they have a much broader research programme. Following the outcomes for young people who do not elect for a medical pathway will be just as important as following those who do.\"A spokesperson for charity Stonewall, which campaigns for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, said all young people should have access to the very best medical care, guided by evidence.\"We urge the government and policymakers to invest in delivering excellent healthcare for trans young people and to make sure the voices of trans young people and their families are at its core.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he later wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!\"Greene said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.She said that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\".

The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where the party only holds a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

    "body": "6 days agoHelen BushbyCulture reporter'She's still the funniest person in the world,' Pauline's son told BBC Breakfast\"She's still funny, she's talking, she's happy.\"Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke was diagnosed with dementia in 2021. Her family, who are unsure what stage she is at, have spoken of the \"disbelief\" they felt at the time. Despite being \"very private\", they told BBC Breakfast they decided to speak out to raise awareness and funds for the condition. \"My mum has always been a charitable person. It's what she would want me to do,\" said her son, Charlie Quirke.Best known for playing Sharon Theodopolopodous in long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, 66-year-old Quirke was also nominated for a Bafta in 1997 for playing a convicted murderer in BBC drama The Sculptress.In 2022, she was made an MBE for services to the entertainment industry, young people, and charities.But earlier this year her husband, Steve Sheen, who she married in 1996, had to announce her retirement.This ended both her 50-year acting career, along with her role as head of Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, which has about 250 academies, and more than 15,000 young students across the UK.Charlie Quirke and Steve Sheen said Quirke still tells them she loves themSteve said they first got an inkling something might be wrong with Quirke in November 2020, after she received a script.\"She started reading it and she phoned me on that day and said, the words are not going in. That's where it started,\" he said.Their reaction after the diagnosis was \"disbelief, really\". \"We looked at each other and went, 'Can't be, it's long Covid. Got the flu'.\"Charlie added he was \"quite surprised that this was possible in a woman in her 60s, and it can happen to people in their 50s, people in their 40s, so it's something you have to deal with and learn about\".Dementia is described as \"young onset\" when symptoms develop before the age of 65. It most often develops in people between the ages of 45 and 65 but can affect people of any age.Asked what stage Quirke is at in her dementia journey, Steve said: \"We don't know. She's still funny. She's talking. She's happy.\"\"Is it four years, eight years, 10 years, 12 years, 20, who knows?\" Charlie added: \"And that's the problem, no one tells you. \"My mum knows exactly who we are. Every time she sees all of us, she smiles, laughs, says 'I love you', says 'hello'.\"They spoke about why they were sharing their experience, and what they had learned so far. \"Unfortunately we are not in the state where we can do much about it,\" Steve said. \"Just take every day and try and take the best moment out of that day you can.\"It's a long journey. If we can just help a little bit by using Pauline as the catalyst to make more people aware, then we should, to use her to boost awareness and raise funds for dementia research.\" (L-R) Pauline Quirke as Sharon Theodopolopodous, Lesley Joseph as Dorien Green and Linda Robson as Tracey Stubbs in Birds of a FeatherSteve said the impact of the condition hit them slowly. \"It's so gradual that for the first year, two years, you're thinking, ah, she's alright. \"Now, we're three or four years in, it's a little bit different. This is why awareness is important. We didn't know how long it lasts or how long you have with it, or how bad it is or how quick it is.\"Charlie added that it \"progresses and changes every day, but so do we - we change and progress, and so we're forever learning\".The NHS website states dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) \"associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Quirke was nominated for a Bafta for playing murderer Olive Martin in BBC series The SculptressNext month, Charlie is doing a fundraising walk for Alzheimer's Research UK, going 140 kilometres to places that shaped his mother's life, including homes she has lived in, theatres and TV studios she has worked at. It will also include the Buckinghamshire headquarters of her children's drama academy. \"This is my mum's legacy,\" he said. \"This is going to be one of the stops on my trek, because she wanted to nurture the next generation of young actors.\"Steve paid tribute to his wife, saying: \"What you see is what you get. Loving. Brilliant. She's an iconic actress because her talent is immense.\"Charlie added: \"She is an incredible, strong, courageous woman that's been through a lot and she keeps going. \"She's a fighter and it's incredible to see, yeah, very proud of her.\"If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoPamela BilalovaNorth East and CumbriaPA MediaThe first sapling was planted at The Tree Sanctuary in CoventryThe first saplings grown from the illegally felled Sycamore Gap tree have been planted.Two saplings were installed in Coventry and Staffordshire, with others set to be planted in Berkshire, Cambridge and Strabane, County Tyrone, the National Trust said.More plantings will take place in Hexham, Leeds and Sunderland next week.It is part of the charity's Trees of Hope initiative, which received nearly 500 applications for the 49 saplings grown from seeds rescued from the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland until two men cut it down in September 2023.Daniel Michael Graham 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, were jailed for four years and three months in July after being convicted of criminal damage.Hilary McGrady, director general of the National Trust, said the saplings would become an inspiration and home for nature, but also a reminder that \"there are always good things worth fighting for, even after something so senseless\".Where will the saplings go?There are 49 saplings in total, one for each foot of the old tree's height.More than half of those will be planted over the course of National Tree Week between 22 and 30 November. The first places to plant their trees were The Tree Sanctuary in Coventry, where three teenagers set up a project to rescue their city's trees, and a site commemorating the Minnie Pit mining disaster in Staffordshire.Saplings will also go to Greenham Common in Berkshire, Lisnafin Community Centre in Strabane and Coton Loves Pollinators in Cambridge.First Sycamore Gap Tree saplings plantedAhead of the event, co-founder of The Tree Sanctuary, Martina Irwin, said planting the sapling would be really special.\"We've chosen to plant it among some other 'saved' trees that we have planted on Sowe Common, serving as a beacon to inspire respect, understanding and a sense of responsibility toward all trees,\" she said.The second sapling was installed at a site commemorating the Minnie Pit mining disaster in Staffordshire'First shoots'Next week, saplings will take root at The Rob Burrow Centre for Motor Neurone Disease at Seacroft Hospital in Leeds, Hexham General Hospital in Northumberland and the charity Veterans in Crisis in Sunderland.Early in December, an additional sapling which was given to the school closest to the Sycamore Gap, Henshaw Church of England Primary, will be planted in its grounds. Another 15 saplings will be housed in each of the UK's National Parks, including Northumberland National Park where the tree stood, in early 2026.John MillarThe Sycamore Gap tree was illegally felled in 2023Andrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust's Hadrian Wall properties, said: \"It's incredible to think that this weekend the first 'offspring' of this very famous tree will be planted.\"It feels like just yesterday that those tentative first shoots appeared.\"He added he hoped the saplings would touch many people's lives \"just like the original tree\".The very first sapling grown from the Sycamore Gap tree was gifted to King Charles III last summer and this will be planted for the nation at a later date, the National Trust said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

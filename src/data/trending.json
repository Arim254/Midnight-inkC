On Tuesday Democratic Rep Ihan Omar was attacked at a local event in the city and protests are continuing following Saturday’s shooting of US citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents. Video evidence contradicts claims by Trump administration officials immediately after Pretti’s killing that he was a “domestic terrorist”, planning a “massacre” and “brandishing” a weapon. \nIn this episode, Sarah, Anthony and Marianna discuss the president’s controversial response to the attack on Democrat Ihan Omar, and whether Trump can actually de-escalate tensions when thousands of ICE agents remain in Minnesota.\nHOSTS:\n- Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n- Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n- Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n- Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n- Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n- Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n- Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni, Kris Jalowiecki and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "7 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US federal government has partially shutdown despite a last-ditch funding deal approved by the Senate.The funding lapse began at midnight US eastern time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, hours after senators agreed to fund most agencies until September. The bill includes just two weeks' funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement, instead of shutting it down entirely.The bill has yet to be approved by the House of Representatives, which is out of session.US President Donald Trump struck the deal with Democrats after they refused to give more funding for immigration enforcement following the fatal shooting of two US citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents.It is the second such government shutdown in the past year and comes just 11 weeks after the end of the previous funding impasse that lasted 43 days, the longest in US history. That shutdown in 2025, which spanned 1 October to 14 November, had widespread impacts on essential government services including air travel and left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for weeks.This shutdown, however, is unlikely to be that long or widespread as the House of Representatives is set to be back in session on Monday. The White House, though, has directed several agencies, including the departments of transportation, education and defence to execute shutdown plans.\"Employees should report to work for their next regularly scheduled tour of duty to undertake orderly shutdown activities,\" a White House memo to agencies said. \"It is our hope that this lapse will be short.\"Trump has urged Republicans, who hold the majority of seats in the US House, to vote for the deal.Lawmakers plan to use the fortnight in which the DHS will continue to be funded to negotiate a deal. Democrats want that deal to include new policies for immigration enforcement agents.\"We need to rein in ICE and end the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\"That means ending roving patrols. It means requiring rules, oversight, and judicial warrants... Masks need to come off, cameras need to stay on, and officers need visible identification. No secret police.\"Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticised tactics used by immigration agents in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend.Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot by a US Border Patrol agent after an altercation in which several agents tried to restrain him. On Friday, the Justice Department launched a civil rights investigation into the shooting.",

    "body": "14 hours agoIsabella Allen,Politics producer in ShanghaiandJennifer McKiernan,Political reporterReutersSeven new shops for Labubu dolls are to open in the UK this year, following the prime minister's trip to China.Chinese toy maker Pop Mart has confirmed it will open a flagship shop on Oxford Street in London's West End, as well as shops in Cardiff and Birmingham, before opening 20 more shops in Europe in 2026.The announcement is part of a package of deals announced by the UK government, including on whisky and cars, which officials claim is worth £2.2bn in export deals.Some have expressed concerns about Sir Keir's visit to China, arguing the country has a poor record on human rights and poses a threat to the UK's national security.Labubus are furry dolls wearing a signature spiky-toothed grin and became a viral purchase last summer, with celebrity fans including Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Kim Kardashian.The legions of fans are happy to queue to snap up the dolls, although to many their appeal is hard to explain. But their popularity has been a boon to Chinese soft power, with state news agency Xinhua saying Labubu \"shows the appeal of Chinese creativity, quality and culture in a language the world can understand\".Pop Mart founder Grant Wang, who expects to bring 150 new jobs to the UK, said: \"London stands at the heart of the global creative ecosystem, and we are thrilled to plant our European roots here.\"Sir Keir has made the first trip to China by a UK prime minister for eight years in an effort to thaw relations and cement trade deals with the second-biggest economy in the world behind the US.On the final day of his three-day visit to Beijing, he announced an estimated  £2.2bn in export deals, as well as new investment.This includes a cut in tariffs on Scottish whisky exports to China, estimated to be worth £250m to the UK economy over the next five years, which will come into force on Monday.The prime minister also met the chairman of car manufacturer Chery, who confirmed the company will open a European headquarters in Liverpool.However, the Conservatives have argued Sir Keir's trip was not in the national interest and Reform UK has called on him to reject trade deals with China until British citizen Jimmy Lai is released from prison.Responding to critics, Sir Keir said: \"Engaging with China, is how we secure growth for British businesses, support good jobs at home, and protect our national security.\"",

    "body": "41 minutes agoJohanna ChisholmBBC NewsBBC/NewsnightChancellor Rachel Reeves has described the student loans system as \"fair and reasonable\" after criticism over the decision to freeze the repayment threshold for some borrowers.Earlier in the week, personal finance expert Martin Lewis said freezing the threshold at which graduates repay their loans was \"not a moral thing\" for her to do as it would be treating the debts like tax.In her November Budget, Reeves announced the salary at which Plan 2 student loans must be paid back would be frozen at £29,385 for three years starting from April 2027.Speaking to BBC Newsnight, she argued the government's measures were \"fair and proportionate\" for getting \"the balance right between tax and spending\". She said the changes announced in her Budget were bringing the different repayment plans in line with each other. \"So you'll start paying back at the same income level. I think that is fair and reasonable,\" the chancellor added.Money Saving Expert founder Lewis had asked the chancellor to \"please have a rethink\" of her policy as he went on to say she was treating student loans as a tax - which he stressed they are not. \"It's a contract that the government signed with young people who had not been given any education on these loans,\" Lewis told Newsnight. \"I do not think it is a moral thing for you to do to be freezing the repayment threshold in this way.\" Plan 2 loans apply to students who started courses in England and Wales between September 2012 and July 2023. The threshold is currently £28,470 for this plan.A freeze would mean workers earning above that amount will be dragged into making larger repayments on their student loans than if the thresholds had risen in line with inflation.Graduates repay 9% of the amount earned above the threshold outlined in their plan.They do not have to start making payments until the April after leaving their course and payments are made automatically through the tax system.But Lewis said there was growing anger, particularly among those in England and Wales with Plan 2 loans, because recent higher inflation has resulted in increased interest rates being applied to the loans.\"When we've had high inflation, their interest rates have gone up and that has been particularly painful,\" Lewis said.  And even though those rates have come down a little, Lewis pointed out, people who took out student loans during this period will have \"a lot more\" added on top \"which makes it more difficult\".Plan 2 loans are charged a rate of interest equal to Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, plus up to 3% on top based on earnings. Someone earning £51,245 or more with a Plan 2 loan will currently be charged 6.2%. By contrast, those with Plan 1 and Plan 5 loans, who started university before 2012 and since 2023 respectively, are currently charged 3.2%.While a higher interest rate does not affect the amount someone repays each month, it makes it harder to reduce the size of the loan, meaning the borrower could repay more over time. The freeze on student loans came at the same time Reeves announced she would be extending the Conservative-initiated freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds for another three years.When those thresholds are frozen, more income is taxed at higher rates as someone's earnings rise, a process known as fiscal drag.Plan 2 loans were introduced from 2012, at the same time the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government tripled tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year.",

His life on the tracks started at British Rail when he was 16; he was then offered a job on the Metro, becoming its youngest train driver at the age of 19.The record had stood \"for all these years, not least because they changed the age limit for the role\", he said.The father-of-two said he and his wife initially went to Florida with their daughters but now go just by themselves, although sometimes they are joined by friends.\"We do all the rollercoasters every time we go,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor has said he has no plans to retire from thrill seekingTaylor admitted the cost of paying for air fares and accommodation so often did add up, but said he did not drink or smoke and bought annual passes to make it more affordable.His favourite ride was the Jurassic World VelociCoaster at the nearby Universal Orlando Resort, which has a launch speed of 70mph (113km/h) - 40% faster than the average metro.Although the lure of Florida has proved irresistible, Taylor has remained loyal to railways. He was a rail guard and then a train driver for 14 years before moving to a role training others.Taylor said it was \"an exciting time\" for the Metro when he started working on it in 1980.\"The Metro was a new concept for the region and millions of pounds had been spent making it become a reality,\" he said.\"I found myself at the age of 19 getting the chance to drive the trains when they were shiny and new.\"I vividly recall being told each one was worth a million quid.\"After that he then became operations manager and, most recently, a service delivery controller.\"All my working life has been on the railways, and it's given me a brilliant career,\" he said.SuppliedTaylor said he and his wife enjoy the food, the entertainment, the people and, most of all, the ridesTaylor said the \"shiny\" trains he started with were now old and \"were more like the rollercoasters where you get flung around\" but the new ones were \"much more smoother, quieter and more comfortable\".More on this story",

    "body": "21 minutes agoAleks PhillipsGetty ImagesThe event at the Yasukuni Shrine (pictured) \"should not have been held in the first place\", the Pokémon Company saidA Pokémon card game event at a shrine honouring Japan's war dead has been cancelled following a backlash in China.The Pokémon Company apologised for advertising the event, organised by a certified third party, through its official website, and said it \"should not have been held in the first place\".The event was due to be held on Saturday at the Yasukuni Shrine, near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, which commemorates those who died in several wars including convicted war criminals.The blunder comes at a moment of worsening relations between China and Japan over the stance of the latter's new prime minister on Taiwan.The Yasukuni Shrine honours Japanese soldiers who died in a number of wars, including both Sino-Japanese wars and the Pacific theatre of World War Two.But the enshrinement of the names of more than 1,000 convicted war criminals among the roughly 2.5 million people it honours has long made it a controversial site for nations that were subject to harsh treatment under Japanese occupation.\"Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned,\" the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official news site, commented when the event came to light earlier this week. \"The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment.\"Meanwhile, the state-run Global Times praised \"China's young net­izens\" for criticising the event, adding: \"Any enter­tain­ment or leis­ure activ­it­ies held at such a site con­sti­tute an open affront to his­tor­ical truth, and sta­ging events aimed at children there is even more egre­gious.\"The Pokémon Company said in a statement on Friday that the event had been \"mistakenly posted\" on its official card game website \"due to a lack of due diligence\".\"After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled,\" it said. \"We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication.\"The firm said it would \"thoroughly review and strengthen\" its approval process to prevent a similar incident from occurring again.Beijing claims the self-governing island as part of its territory, and has not ruled out taking it by force.The row saw the governments of both nations urge their citizens not to travel to the other, while the release of two popular Japanese films in China were also postponed.Pokémon, which began as a video game in 1996, has since become an internationally renowned media franchise spanning films, TV series and trading card games.",

    "body": "10 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPhone lines are being opened and webchat services extended by the UK's tax authority on the final day before the self-assessment deadline.Millions of people who are self-employed or have more than one source of income are required to file a 2024-25 tax return online by the end of January.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has scaled up Saturday support for those leaving it to the last minute. Some 1.1 million people missed the cut-off a year ago.Previous excuses for failing to file have included being up a mountain or yachting around the world. Reasonable excuses for avoiding fines include serious illness or a close family bereavement.Anyone who fails to complete a required return by the end of Saturday faces an automatic £100 fine and the possibility of further penalties.More than 10 million people have already filed the latest tax return, according to HMRC, but thousands always leave it to the final day.The tax authority said digital services were the fastest way to access support on Saturday. A webchat was being extended to 10 times its usual Saturday capacity, with the digital assistant service running all day as normal.The telephone helpline, usually closed on weekends, is open from 09:00 GMT to 16:00 GMT for those who need to speak to someone about self assessment. HMRC has faced sharp criticism in the past for the time it takes to answer phone calls, and waits are expected to be relatively long on Saturday. Who files and who doesn'tMillions of people pay only have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file.They include those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.Some not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who have switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.Some people may be missing out on tax relief by submitting an incomplete tax return or not doing one at all.Sir Steve Webb, partner at consultancy LCP, estimated that about 800,000 higher or additional rate taxpayers could be missing out on extra tax relief by failing to declare a personal pension or other \"relief at source\" scheme.Penalties can build upThose required to complete a return must also pay any tax bill.\"Filing the return is only half the battle - you must also pay any tax owed for the 2024-25 tax year by January 31 which will require sufficient cleared funds available in your bank account ahead of the deadline,\" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.Those who are unable to pay in full by January 31 may be able to set up a \"time to pay\" arrangement online if they owe less than £30,000 and meet the criteria.Anyone missing the filing deadline faces the following penalties: An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on timeAfter three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greaterThere are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 monthsIf tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owedHMRC will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a reasonable excuse may avoid a penalty.People should also watch out for scams, with criminals attempting to dupe taxpayers by purporting to be from HMRC. Fraudsters may threaten people, claiming they have an unpaid tax bill, or they may make offers of fake rebates.Digital overhaul from AprilFrom April, taxpayers with more than £50,000 of gross income from self-employment or rental income in the 2024-25 tax year will need to comply with Making Tax Digital rules which will replace self assessment. They must keep digital records using approved software and submit quarterly income and expense summaries to HMRC. The threshold drops to £30,000 from April 2027 then £20,000 from April 2028.\"Making Tax Digital is the biggest tax change since self assessment and, with just over two months to go, time is running out to get ready,\" said Victoria Todd, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, which has produced a guide for those unsure of the changes.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAmy WalkerWatch: A look back at the work of Catherine O'HaraMeryl Streep, Pedro Pascal and Ben Stiller are among celebrities to have paid tribute to Emmy-winning comedic actress Catherine O'Hara, who died on Friday aged 71.The Canadian-born star was best known for her roles in the films Beetlejuice and Home Alone, as well as comedy TV series including Schitt's Creek and The Studio. Streep said O'Hara brought \"love and light to our world, through whipsmart compassion for the collection of eccentrics she portrayed\", while The Last of Us co-star Pascal said he was \"eternally grateful\" to have worked with her.Ben Stiller said it was \"hard to explain the impact she had on comedy\", adding that for him there was \"no one better\".O'Hara died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles following a brief illness, her agent told the BBC.After starting her career in Canada's comedy scene, she turned out a series of unforgettable film performances netting her critical acclaim.Streep, who appeared alongside O'Hara in the 1980s comedy Heartburn, described her death as \"such a loss for her family and friends, and the audience she graced as friends\".Michael Keaton, who co-starred in 1988's Beetlejuice and its 2024 sequel Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, remarked: \"We go back before the first Beetlejuice. She's been my pretend wife, my pretend nemesis and my real life, true friend.\"This one hurts. Man am I gonna miss her.\"Tim Burton, who directed both films, shared a picture of the cast of the latter film on Facebook.\"Catherine, I love you,\" he said. \"This picture shows how much light you gave to all of us. You were a special part of my life and afterlife.\"Alec Baldwin, who also starred in the film, said O'Hara possessed \"a quality that was all her own\" and described her as \"one of the greatest comic talents in the movie business\".In his tribute, Pascal said \"there is less light in my world\" adding: \"This lucky world that had you will keep you, always.\"'I'm so proud of you' - O'Hara speaks at Macaulay Culkin Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonyHer on-screen son in holiday classics Home Alone and Home Alone 2: Lost In New York, Macaulay Culkin, also paid an emotional tribute on Instagram.\"Mama. I thought we had time. I wanted more. I wanted to sit in a chair next to you,\" he wrote.\"I heard you. But I had so much more to say. I love you. I'll see you later.\"O'Hara's popularity had a resurgence of late after she starred as the outlandish Moira in Schitt's Creek.The show's co-creator Dan Levy described her as \"family before she ever played my family\".He added on Instagram that he would \"cherish every funny memory I was fortunate enough to make with her\".His father, Eugene, who also starred in the series, had a longtime friendship with O'Hara having collaborated with her many times over a period spanning more than 50 years.\"Words seem inadequate to express the loss I feel today,\" he told Variety in a statement.\"I cherished our working relationship, but most of all our friendship. And I will miss her.\"Getty ImagesO'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, who she married in 1992, and their two sonsAlongside winning a Golden Globe award for best actress in 2021 for her role in Schitt's Creek, O'Hara was nominated for portraying ousted movie executive Patty Leigh in Seth Rogen's satirical swipe at the workings of Hollywood, The Studio, at this year's awards.She also remains nominated at the Actor Awards (formerly the Screen Actors Guild Awards), which take place in March, for her role as Patty.Rogen said on Friday that, when he first met O'Hara, he told her she \"was the funniest person I'd ever had the pleasure of watching on screen\" and that Home Alone was the film that made him want to make movies.\"Getting to work with her was a true honour,\" he wrote on Instagram.O'Hara was also described as \"one of the comic giants of our age\" by actor and director Christopher Guest, who worked with her on four films including 2006's For Your Consideration.His wife, actress Jamie Lee Curtis, shared a clip of O'Hara in Guest's 1996 mockumentary Waiting for Guffman, alongside the caption \"BEST OF THE BEST IN SHOW\", a reference to the title of one of his later films that also starred O'Hara.Fellow Canadian actor and comedian Mike Myers - of Austin Powers and Shrek fame - described her death as \"a very sad day for comedy and for Canada\".Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described her as a \"beloved Canadian icon\", while the country's current leader Mark Carney said it had \"lost a legend\".O'Hara is survived by her husband Bo Welch, her sons Matthew and Luke, and her six siblings.",

    "body": "8 hours agoOttilie MitchellWatch: Nationwide anti-ICE protests draw large crowdsThousands of protesters have taken to the streets of Minneapolis as part of nationwide demonstrations against immigration enforcement action after the fatal shootings of two US citizens by federal agents.Protests were also held in cities across the US, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC, with organisers calling on Americans to stay home from work and school.The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have ignited local protests and caused public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties.The 37-year-old nurse was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. Good, the first, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January.Organisers of the protest, called the National Shutdown, called for \"no work. No school. No shopping\" on 30 January and to \"stop funding ICE\".The action was organised over the deaths of Pretti and Good, as well as others killed by ICE including Silverio Villegas-Gonzales, who was shot by an ICE agent in September 2025, according to the group's website.Protesters formed the letters \"SOS\" on top of a frozen lake in southern Minneapolis, while one group marched through the streets carrying a large-scale replica of the preamble to the US constitution.Singer Bruce Springsteen also performed a newly released song in honour of Pretti and Good entitled Streets of Minneapolis at a concert in the city.

We're just doing it smarter,\" he said during a news conference. Homan began leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minneapolis after it was announced Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino would be leaving the area.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday evening: \"We will keep our country safe, we'll do whatever we can to keep our country safe.\" About 3,000 federal agents were sent to Minnneapolis at Trump's directive.The DHS has said it was arresting the \"worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens\" in an effort to restore public safety in Minnesota, but critics argue migrants with clean records and US citizens are being caught up in the campaign.Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the immigration enforcement initiative has sparked outcry from residents in Minneapolis, St Paul and other cities in the state.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey have called on federal agents to withdraw from Minneapolis.Getty Images",

The White House Chief of Staff, referred to by the president as the “most powerful woman in the world”, is the gatekeeper to the Oval Office and a crucial figure in delivering Trump’s national agenda. \nShe also rarely speaks to the media, making her an elusive figure in the president’s top team despite her significant influence. But in a series of interviews for Vanity Fair, she refers to Donald Trump as having an “alcoholic’s personality”, describes JD Vance as a “conspiracy theorist” and Elon Musk as an “odd, odd duck”. The White House has described the articles as a “framed hit piece” and accused Vanity Fair of taking statements out of context.\nIn today’s podcast, Justin and Anthony go through some of the most revealing lines from the interviews, and speak to the journalist who sat down with Susie Wiles - Chris Whipple - to find out why he thinks Wiles wanted to speak with him, and how he responds to White House criticism of the interviews.\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 Presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGUEST:\nChris Whipple, Journalist and author of several White House books, including Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History \nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles.

    "body": "8 hours agoCachella SmithEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe Trevi Fountain is one of Rome's key attractions with around nine million visitors this yearTourists in Italy's capital Rome will soon have to pay a €2 (£1.75; $2.34) entrance fee if they want to see its famed Trevi Fountain up close.The new barrier for visitors to view the Baroque monument will come into force from 1 February 2026.While the coins tossed into the fountain are donated to charity, the fees collected will go to the city authority to pay for upkeep and managing visitors. The city expects to raise €6.5m a year from the fountain alone.Announcing the move on Friday, Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri was quote by news agency Reuters as saying that \"two euros isn't very much ... and it will lead to less chaotic tourist flows\".The Trevi levy is part of a new tariff system for certain museums and monuments in the Italian capital.Access to a number of sites that currently charge for entry will become free for Rome's residents, such as the Sacred Area of Largo Argentina.At the same time, tourists and non-residents will have to pay to see the Trevi fountain and five other attractions including the Napoleonic Museum.Children under the age of five, and those with disabilities and an accompanying person, will be exempt from the fees.Tourists will still be able to view the Trevi Fountain - built by Italian architect Nicola Salvi in the 18th Century - for free from a distance.The site currently sees an average of 30,000 visitors per day, according to the City of Rome.Following restoration work which took place last year, Gualtieri introduced a queuing system to prevent large crowds massing around the landmark.Access is capped at 400 people at the same time.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThe Times leads with a new tranche of documents released by the US Department of Justice, including \"a previously unseen photograph of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying across the laps of five women\". The photo appears to show the former prince, Ghislaine Maxwell, and redacted faces of six people. Andrew has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and says he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction\". Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The Prince of Wales \"joins the SAS\" as a \"patron of [the] elite unit's charity\", which \"supports soldiers, veterans and families\", reports the Daily Mirror citing an unnamed royal source. Also featured on the front page is the black-and-white photo of Andrew \"draped across women's laps... as Maxwell looks on\", according to the paper.The Daily Telegraph leads with publisher HarperCollins UK dropping best-selling author and comedian David Walliams. The paper says it investigated allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards young women. The publisher does not specify the reason for dismissing Walliams. A spokesperson for Walliams says he has \"never been informed of any allegations raised against him\" by his publisher. \"He was not party to any investigation or given any opportunity to answer questions. David strongly denies that he has behaved inappropriately and is taking legal advice,\" the spokesperson adds.The Walliams story also leads the Daily Star's front page. A spokesperson for HarperCollins says it has decided not to release any new titles by Walliams \"after careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO\". Chancellor Rachel Reeves is accused of ruining Christmas for retailers, reports the Daily Mail. It says customers \"surprisingly shunned\" Black Friday sales, as retailers say \"December has been disastrous, with the 'bleak' outlook stretching into January\". Critics cited by the paper blame the government's \"£30bn Budget tax raid\". The i Paper leads with its interview of Reeves, who does not \"rule out tax rises in 2026\". The paper quotes the chancellor saying she hopes \"further changes to tax are less necessary\", while noting \"the world is incredibly volatile at the moment\". Her remarks follow the government's \"£66bn in tax hikes\" laid out in the November Budget, which the paper reports led to accusations of \"breaking the Labour manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, NI (national insurance), or VAT (value-added tax)\".The Financial Times leads with the EU's €90bn (£79bn) loan to Ukraine, calling it a \"lifeline for hard-up Kyiv\". It notes the bloc's \"plan to use frozen Russian assets collapsed\" following objections from Belgium, warning it would be legally and financial liable.The Independent leads with the latest in Ukraine, combining the EU's €90bn (£79bn) loan and strike on a Russian oil tanker in the Mediterranean Sea in its headline. Russian President Vladimir Putin's response is also included, \"as he accuses Western allies of 'dirty tricks'\" over the European loan and \"vows revenge for (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky's drone attack\".A \"robot surgery revolution\" is splashed on the Daily Express's front page. It says the new technology could \"cut patients' recovery time and free up beds\".Warnings to the government that it could \"risk a 'lost generation'\" due to \"rising inactivity among young people\" leads the Guardian. Former health secretary Alan Milburn tells the paper the government must tackle some \"uncomfortable truths\" about the labour market, as he leads an inquiry that will include a review into the \"future of the youth minimum wage\".And finally, the Sun reports TV chef James Martin has announced he is engaged to his personal trainer partner Kim Johnson. The paper writes he got \"down on one knead\".Related Internet Links",

Some of his books, including Gangsta Granny and Billionaire Boy, have also been adapted into television films.He has published more than 40 books in total, including a Christmas book titled Santa & Son, which was published by HarperCollins in October.He first rose to fame on TV sketch series Little Britain and has also won National Television Awards for his work as a judge on Britain's Got Talent.He was made an OBE in 2017 for his services to charity and the arts.But he has faced controversies including being criticised after appearing to make two Nazi salutes during a recording of BBC comedy panel show Would I Lie To You? this summer.In 2022, he apologised and admitted making \"disrespectful comments\" about two Britain's Got Talent contestants during a break in filming.He left the programme that year and sued the production company over the leaking of the remarks, reaching a settlement with them in 2023. HarperCollins UK appointed Kate Elton as its new chief executive in October.",

Announcing the rebrand on the Archewell website on Friday, Prince Harry and Meghan said the charity allowed the couple and their children to \"expand upon their global philanthropic endeavours as a family\". The charity was established in 2020 after the couple stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US.Meanwhile, the couple's Christmas card message reads: \"On behalf of the Office of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and Archewell, we wish you a very happy holiday season and a joyful new year.\"It comes a day after the Prince and Princess of Wales released a new family portrait which featured on their Christmas card this year.The image shows Prince William and Catherine surrounded by daffodils, alongside their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.Earlier this month, King Charles III and Queen Camilla released their own Christmas card with a photo of them in Rome, Italy.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHafsa KhalilandIan Youngs,Culture reporterTimothée Chalamet has finally quashed rumours that he is cult anonymous rapper EsDeeKid - by performing alongside him in a new video.Speculation has run riot that the Oscar-nominated US actor has been leading a double life as the masked rapper, who only ever reveals his eyes.Some followers spotted an apparent resemblance with Chalamet's eyes, and when the BBC questioned the star about the connection earlier this week, he responded: \"No comment... You'll see, all in due time.\"Now, the actor - who adopted the hip-hop moniker Lil Timmy Tim in high school - has scotched the conspiracies by posting a video of himself rapping alongside EsDeeKid on a remix of the musician's top 40 hit 4Raws.In the music video, Chalamet appeared to refer to the rumours by starting with only his eyes on show, like the drill artist, before pulling down the bandana from his face and dropping the bars: \"It's Timothée Chalamet chillin', tryin' to stack $100 million.\"He then referenced his partner Kylie Jenner with the line: \"Girl got $1 billion.\"The clip was filmed at Andover Minimarket Off Licence in north London, and was reposted by EsDeeKid.The speculation has been seized upon by fans in recent weeks, and both sides stayed silent as EsDeeKid reached the UK top 10 and Chalamet promoted his new film.BBC Radio One's Greg James also quizzed Chalamet in an interview this week about his connection to EsDeeKid, where he responded: \"All will be revealed in due time.\" James updated his caption on social media overnight noting \"all was revealed\". He even gave the title, Marty Supreme, several shout-outs in the new collaboration, building on an already savvy marketing campaign for the film.But it was always far-fetched that the two people could be one and the same, and that Chalamet could have pulled off rapping with EsDeeKid's Liverpudlian accent.Their collaboration quickly went viral, with British rapper Central Cee replying \"Naaa\" with crying and laughing emojis, Tinie Tempah posting \"Hahha this is sickkk\" and US star Shaboozey declaring \"This going #1\".

    "body": "10 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentGetty ImagesForeign nationals working as prison officers in the UK have been given a temporary exemption from new visa rules, following warnings some jails were facing a staffing crisis.Prisons have increasingly been relying on overseas recruits, particularly from Nigeria and Ghana.But organisations representing officers had warned jails faced losing thousands of staff, after the government increased the minimum salary requirement for a skilled worker visa.The Ministry of Justice said the move would \"ensure jails can continue to run safely with the right level of experienced staff\".Under changes introduced in July as part of efforts to reduce migration, individuals must earn at least £41,700 to obtain a skilled worker visa, up from £38,700.The starting salary for a prison officer is generally below this amount, particularly outside London.The Prison Officers Association (POA) said the salary threshold changes meant jails stood to lose more than 2,500 overseas recruits, which it said would have had \"a catastrophic effect on prison stability\".Meanwhile, chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor warned earlier this year that many jails were heavily dependent on prison officers recruited from west Africa.He said many were in danger of not having their visas renewed, which would have a \"devastating effect\" on prisons.The exemption only applies to applicants already in the country and lasts until the end of 2026, with a lower salary threshold of £33,400 in place until 31 December 2027.The POA welcomed the new exemption, calling it a victory for \"common sense\".The trade union's general secretary Steve Gillan said: \"It might not be perfect, but it will mean the prison service hopefully can remain stable.\"The association's national chairman Mark Fairhurst added: \"Our members can now go about their daily lives without the threat of removal from the country.\" The Times newspaper reported that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood had initially resisted granting the exemption, arguing that the focus should be on recruiting British people.Earlier this week, Justice Secretary David Lammy told MPs he was in discussions with Mahmood over the issue.He stressed that he wanted to recruit more prison officers locally, but \"the most important thing\" was to meet the demand for prison places.A Home Office source said prisons were being treated differently given their importance to public safety and national security. They denied Mahmood was against the move, but said she wanted it to be temporary, with prisons hiring British workers in the future.A Ministry of Justice source said prisons were under strain and the exemption would provide \"breathing space\" to structure a programme to hire more officers from the UK.A government spokesperson said: \"Net migration has already fallen by more than two-thirds under this government. We are clear numbers must fall further as we create a migration system that is controlled and fair.\"However, public safety is the first duty of any government and we must ensure jails can continue to run safely with the right level of experienced staff. This is vital given the prison capacity crisis we inherited.\"Prisons have been able to sponsor visa applications for overseas recruits since 2023 due to a shortage of British applicants.In April, the government revealed more than 700 Nigerians had been recruited to work in UK prisons last year, with the nationality accounting for 29% of job applicants and 12% of staff hired at jails in England and Wales.This made Nigerians the most common nationality behind Britons to apply for or be offered a job in UK prisons in 2024. This was followed by people from Ghana, who had 140 job offers.The Prison Governors Association has said a surge in applications from west Africa appears to have been fuelled by word of mouth and jobs being promoted online by the expat Nigerian community.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSteve RosenbergBBC Russia Editor, MoscowReporters ask world leaders questions all the time.No big deal. Right?But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. \"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.Putin returns to my question.\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.",

    "body": "The US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom, which directs American military operations in Europe, Africa and the Indo-Pacific, said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Meanwhile, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OBHR) said IS positions near the cities of Raqqa and Deir ez Zor were targeted.It said that a prominent IS leader and a number of fighters were killed.IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to verify the targets immediately.Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.In 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

I was scared by the loud bang to start with, and it was enormous.\"Ian, who suspected a traffic accident had happened outside at first, tried to call the RSPCA and police but without any offer of support late at night, the pair decided to wait and see if the goose survived until the morning.Lynne said: \"We opened the door a bit and pushed a little small blanket in there for it, just in case, and a bowl of water, some porridge oats, because we didn't know what else to give him.\"I was thinking about it all night in bed, wondering what to expect the next morning.\"'Wrapped him up'Ian then managed to arrange for Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital in Kibworth Harcourt to collect the goose.He said: \"In the morning, I came downstairs, looked out, and yes, he was still alive.\"A lady called Amy came and wrapped him up and took him off.\"We spent around an hour getting all the glass out and the porch smelt a bit, but you can imagine.\"Ian BullockAmy Blower, from Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital, collected the stricken fowlAmy Blower, team leader at Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital, said it was \"a shock\" to hear about the crash landing and believed the bird might have been tired and misjudged its descent.\"It's very unusual to be in the middle of a housing estate and flying that late at night.\"Surprisingly, he's just come off with a few minor scrapes and wounds from the glass he's smashed through.\"He had a small laceration to his beak and one just on the left side of his body - but other than that, he was pretty much absolutely fine,\" she said.The goose is expected to be released back into the wild after a course of pain medication and antibiotics.Lynne said she had now boarded up her front door and was arranging a repair through her insurance company.She said: \"I really don't know how it could have gone through that glass and survived.\"The chances of that happening, it's just not what you expect, is it?\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

With this designation, it joins a global network of 408 cities across more than 100 countries committed to promoting \"creativity as a driver of sustainable urban development\".The recognition \"is a testament to its deep-rooted culinary traditions and vibrant food ecosystem\", Tim Curtis, director and representative, Unesco Regional Office for South Asia, said.\"It honours the city's rich cultural legacy while opening new avenues for international collaboration,\" he added.Lucknow is only the second Indian city - after Hyderabad which was selected in 2019 - to find a place in this coveted list of 70 cities globally.The accolade for my home city doesn't surprise residents or food lovers - many echo celebrity chef Ranveer Brar's take: \"Better late than never. It should have come before.\"With the Unesco recognition, my beloved, chaotic, eclectic city - the capital of India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh - is finally in the spotlight for what has always defined its soul: a passion for food.Madhavi Kuckreja, founder of Sanatkada Trust which is spearheading a project on the Kitchens of Lucknow, told the BBC that what gives the city's food its distinct flavour is the slow pace and the time taken to cook a dish.\"'What will be cooked, how will it be cooked?' is a continued conversation from waking up until going to bed in most homes. And you are actually judged by the quality of food that comes out of your kitchen,\" she says.But this focus on food is not new and many of the dishes that have come to define the city's cuisine have been around for hundreds of years.Maroof CulmenLucknow is famous for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabsThe City of Nawabs - as it's popularly called after its 18th and 19th Century wealthy Muslim rulers - is known for its melt-in-the-mouth kebabs and a distinctive take on biryani that were created, evolved and taken to sublime levels in their kitchens.These royal kitchens were centres of culinary innovations, blending the Persian and local Indian styles to create what became the cuisine of Awadh - as the region was then called.It was during this time that Lucknow's most famous kebabs were fashioned. The story goes that the mutton galouti kebabs that have defined the city amongst visitors were created to feed an ageing nawab who had lost his teeth. His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list. Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.Maroof CulmenThe city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winterThe local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad. Nearly 150 years after it was set up in 1880, the place is still much sought-after for its hot kachoris (fried bread stuffed with lentils) and jalebis (crispy sweet made of deep-fried fermented batter and soaked in sugar syrup).Its sixth-generation owners - father Anmol Agarwal and sons Anoop and Pranshu - continue to safeguard the process and craftsmanship behind every recipe. An automobile engineer by education, Pranshu is passionate about his legacy. \"This runs in my blood. There is nothing else I would rather do,\" he says.Getty ImagesThe Sharmaji Tea Stall is famous for its milky masala chaiThe city also offers unique seasonal delights, such as makkhan malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter. The process of making it is scientific and complicated. The cook hand-churns the milk and then leaves it out at night, exposed to the dew that gives it its incredible frothy texture.On cold mornings, street vendors can be seen lined up in old city areas like Aminabad and Chowk. Many, however, say that their children do not want to learn the art.Chef Brar, who is also from Lucknow and has been an unequivocal advocate for its food, has often said that the city's rich food legacy places it right on top of the pile of the Indian street food experience. But the real value from the Unesco recognition, he says, will occur only if Lucknow can now create awareness about its lesser-known eateries.Ms Kukreja says every dish in Lucknow tells a story - shaped by generational food businesses, from humble street carts to bustling restaurants, and guarded family recipes.The international acclaim, she hopes, will encourage more people around the world to learn these stories and visit the city to savour the culinary delights of Lucknow.",

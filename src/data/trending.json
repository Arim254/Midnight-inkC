    "body": "VAR errors increase: Each of the 13 mistakes so far this seasonImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool and Bournemouth were drawing 0-0 when Marcos Senesi should have been sent off through a VAR reviewByFootball issues correspondentVideo assistant referee errors have risen in the first half of the Premier League season.Data collected by BBC Sport taken from the Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) Panel shows mistakes have increased 30% season-on-season from 10 to 13.It is still a marked improvement on previous years, with 20 errors at this stage of the 2023-24 campaign and 23 in 2022-23.All but two of the mistakes are missed interventions, up from seven to 11, when the video assistant refereee (VAR) failed to advise the referee he should change a decision.Incorrect interventions are down from three to two. But total overturns have also dropped from 57 in 2024-25 to 47 this season - a fall of 17.54%.The KMI Panel also catalogues on-field mistakes which did not reach the clear and obvious threshold for VAR to intervene. There are also up from 12 to 15.Here is every mistake this season across these categories.How the KMI Panel worksThe KMI Panel meets every week to dissect each decision, from goals to penalties to red cards.  It has five members: three former players and coaches, plus one representative each from the Premier League and Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO).The KMI Panel was created by the Premier League clubs in 2022 to take performance stats out of the hands of the refereeing body.Crucially, it is not intended to look at each incident like any fan or manager would. It takes into account the laws of the game and, crucially, how the Premier League expects its games to be refereed. That is why the list of errors will not be as extensive as supporters would expect.The KMI Panel first looks at the decision of the on-field referee team, and then of the VAR.As the VAR is operating to a higher threshold - clear and obvious - there are times when the KMI Panel will say the referee was wrong but the VAR was correct not to intervene. The KMI Panel also considers second yellow cards which were missed, or incorrectly shown.1. Liverpool 4-2 Bournemouth: Senesi red cardThe ball accidentally hit Marcos Senesi's arm but he then deliberately batted it away just as Hugo Ekitike was about to run through on goal. The referee did not show Senesi a card having deemed it to not be foul play.The VAR, Michael Oliver, only looked at the first touch on the arm.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is a secondary action by Senesi, where he moves his arm to flick the ball away, which is a handball offence. The majority feel that this was an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.\"2. Chelsea 2-0 Fulham: King's goal is disallowedThe game was goalless in the 21st minute when Josh King scored to give Fulham the lead. Referee Rob Jones initially gave the goal. It was wrongly ruled out through a VAR review for a foul in the build-up by Rodrigo Muniz on Trevoh Chalobah.This was a high-profile error which led to the VAR, Michael Salisbury, being stood down from his next appointment. On-field vote: 5-0VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Muniz has possession and Chalobah tries to step in to win the ball. This contact is normal in the context of the skill Muniz was performing.\"3. Wolves 2-3 Everton: Bueno denied a penaltyHugo Bueno tried to jink back inside in the 70th minute, but went down under a challenge from Iliman Ndiaye.Referee Michael Oliver allowed play to continue and the VAR, Craig Pawson, decided there was not enough in it for a review.Wolves trailed 3-1 at the time and could have got back into the game. On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Bueno turns back into Ndiaye who does not make any contact on the ball. The contact made is careless and the panel felt that a penalty should have been awarded.\"4. Brentford 3-1 Man Utd: Collins escapes red cardImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Nathan Collins escaped with only a yellow card after dragging back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to shootNathan Collins pulled back Bryan Mbeumo as he was about to latch on to a pass. Referee Craig Pawson gave the penalty but only cautioned Collins. The VAR, Andy Madley, did not think Mbeumo was in control to be denied a scoring chance. Brentford, 2-1 up in the 71st minute, should have been reduced to 10 men. And Bruno Fernandes' penalty was saved.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"There is an impactful holding action by Collins which is not an attempt to play the ball. Mbuemo is clearly prevented from having a clear shot at goal.\"5. Chelsea 1-3 Brighton: Gusto's high bootMalo Gusto raised a foot to make a clearance, not realising Yankuba Minteh was behind him. The Brighton player went down holding his head, but referee Simon Hooper did not believe there was contact. The VAR, Darren England, felt there was no conclusive proof for an overturn.The game was 1-1 in the 87th minute but Brighton scored twice in stoppage time.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 0-5What the panel said: \"Gusto's foot is raised and makes clear contact with the shoulder and head of Minteh and the VAR should have intervened.\"6. Crystal Palace 3-3 Bournemouth: Senesi avoids red againImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marcos Senesi would have been suspended for a total of three games had he been shown the two red cardsReferee Jarred Gillett was sent to the pitchside monitor by the VAR, Alex Chilowicz.Gillett rejected the advice that Senesi should be sent off for a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (DOGSO) foul on Ismaila Sarr. He stuck by his yellow card because he felt the ball was moving away from goal. Bournemouth were 2-0 up in the 51st minute when the incident happened. This goes down as a correct VAR intervention, but incorrect final outcome. On-field vote: 3-2VAR vote: 3-2What the panel said: \"The majority felt that Sarr was very likely to gain possession with the ability to create an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"7. Brentford 3-1 Newcastle: Burn trips OuattaraImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dango Ouattara was booked for simulation but the Premier League's KMI Panel says he should have been awarded a penalty kickDan Burn stood on the foot of Dango Ouattara with the Brentford player theatrically throwing himself to the ground.It was the reaction which caused the VAR, Paul Tierney, to stay out of it. Brentford did get a penalty shortly afterwards for a clash between the same two players. On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel were unanimous in their view that Burn commits a careless tripping offence. The panel were however split regarding the VAR outcome. Two members felt that the referee's call should stand as the contact was glancing.\"8. Bournemouth 2-2 West Ham: Kilman's swipe at the ballImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Max Kilman should have been sent off for handball through a VAR review as well as conceding a spot-kickBournemouth trailed West Ham 2-0 when they were given a penalty in the 66th minute. Max Kilman had handled the ball when he was on the ground.Referee Thomas Bramall only showed a yellow card, and VAR Michael Oliver supported that.But there had been a deliberate movement of the arm by Kilman to prevent Evanilson getting a shot off.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"There is clear evidence that Kilman makes an additional movement with his arm to swipe the ball and in doing so this denies an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\"9. Newcastle 2-1 Man City: Foden caught lateImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The game was goalless when Fabian Schar fouled Phil Foden inside the box, and Newcastle went on to win the game 2-1The game was goalless after 17 minutes when Phil Foden released a shot. He was caught late by Fabian Schar.Defenders are given a fair bit of latitude to try to block a shot, and a natural collision will not be ruled as a penalty. On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Despite Foden getting a shot away, Schar makes a reckless foul challenge. Two panellists supported the decision as contact was a consequence of the momentum of the blocking action, and not clearly reckless.\"10. Wolves 1-4 Man Utd: Agbadou handballEmmanuel Agbadou angled his body into the path of a shot to stop the ball, but VAR Stuart Attwell did not send referee Michael Salisbury to the monitor.On-field vote: 0-5VAR vote: 1-4What the panel said: \"Agbadou leans in towards the ball with a straight arm and his arm blocks the shot heading towards goal.\"11. Everton 0-1 Arsenal: Gunners get luckyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Everton could have made it 1-1 from the penalty spot had there been a VAR interventionEverton were losing 1-0 when William Saliba and Thierno Barry went for a bouncing ball. Barry got there first and was kicked by the Arsenal defender. The VAR, Michael Salisbury, decided there wasn't enough contact to send referee Sam Barrott to the screen.On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"A late challenge where Saliba carelessly kicks Barry with no contact on the ball. Two panellists supported the on-field no penalty call as they felt there was not enough impact and a delayed reaction.\"12. Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth: Gusto avoids another spot-kickFor the second time the VAR failed to intervene to award a penalty against Gusto.It was 2-2 in the 54th minute when Marcus Tavernier played a long cross to David Brooks. Gusto jumped to head it and the ball landed on his outstretched arm.The VAR, Craig Pawson, wrongly determined that the ball had hit the Chelsea player too high on the arm for handball.On-field vote: 1-4VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"The panel felt that the ball hit the 'red zone' of his arm that was raised in an unjustifiable position.\"13. Brentford 0-0 Tottenham: Romero escapes redImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Tottenham would have had to play for 10 men for almost 40 minutes had Cristian Romero been sent offIgor Thiago ran on to a ball over the top in the 56th minute, with Tottenham defender Cristian Romero making a wild swipe to try to intercept.Romero made no contact on the ball and brought down the Brentford striker. The VAR, Alex Chilowicz, felt there was no clear and obvious error in not giving the foul.  On-field vote: 2-3VAR vote: 2-3What the panel said: \"Romero doesn't play the ball and then brings down Thiago,  who has a high likelihood of gaining control of the ball, travelling towards goal, with no covering defenders.\"How clubs have been affectedThe number of mistakes only tell part of the story. It is just as important when they happened.For instance, the one error Brighton suffered came late in a game at Chelsea which they went on to win 3-1. The mistake had no impact upon the result. Errors suffered:Bournemouth 2Brentford 2Manchester United 2Brighton 1Crystal Palace 1Everton 1Fulham 1Liverpool 1Manchester City 1Wolves 1Bournemouth, Brentford and Manchester United have suffered two VAR errors. Manchester United would argue that had Brentford been reduced to 10 men they would have had a better chance of rescuing the game. Their other error came in a 4-1 win at Wolves.Brentford have experience of this too, as Spurs should have had 10 men for most of the second half in that match. Their second error suffered came in the win against Newcastle.Bournemouth were affected when West Ham's Kilman was not sent off after conceding a penalty in the 69th minute of a 2-2 draw. They should also have had a penalty at Chelsea in a game which was also 2-2.Errors gained from:Chelsea 3Bournemouth 2Newcastle 2Arsenal 1Brentford 1Everton 1Tottenham 1West Ham 1Wolves 1Chelsea have gained the most from errors. Their home win over Fulham and draw with Bournemouth could have had different outcomes if the VAR had got the decisions correct.Bournemouth twice should have had Senesi sent off: in the 3-3 at Crystal Palace and the loss at Liverpool.Newcastle should have conceded an early penalty in their win over Manchester City, though they lost at Brentford.Arsenal, Brentford and Everton benefited in games they won; Tottenham's and West Ham's came in draws.VAR decisions by club so far this seasonWhat about all the other mistakes?The second category is mistakes on the field which the KMI Panel felt did not reach the threshold for a VAR intervention.There have been 15 this season, compared to 12 in 2024-25.The 15 are:Man City v Tottenham: Penalty not given for a foul on Oscar BobbBrentford v Aston Villa: Goal disallowed for a push on Emiliano MartinezArsenal v Leeds: Penalty given for a foul on Max DowmanFulham v Man City: Goal awarded despite push on Calvin BasseySunderland v Brentford: Penalty not given for Reinildo holding Nathan CollinsWest Ham v Tottenham: Disallowed goal for a foul by Micky van de VenMan City v Liverpool: Disallowed goal, Andrew Robertson offside and impactingSunderland v Bournemouth: Penalty given for a foul on ReinildoChelsea v Arsenal: Enzo Fernandez offside and impacting on Trevoh Chalobah goalTottenham v Brentford: Cristian Romero serious foul play red cardFulham v Crystal Palace: Penalty not given for challenge by Joachim AndersenLiverpool v Brighton: No serious foul play red card for Diego GomezNewcastle v Chelsea: No penalty for challenge on Anthony GordonWolves v Brentford: Penalty award for foul by Caoimhin KelleherBrentford v Tottenham: Penalty for a foul on Archie GrayIf a decision has not appeared on this page then the KMI Panel voted it correct on the field and through VAR.Missed second yellow cardsThe panel has ruled that five players have escaped a second caution. At the halfway stage of 2024-25 there had been eight errors.This season's list is: Malick Thiaw for Newcastle at BournemouthAndre for Wolves at Aston VillaAaron Wan-Bissaka for West Ham at Manchester UnitedRuben Dias for Manchester City at Nottingham ForestMikel Merino for Arsenal at home to Aston Villa",

    "body": "4 hours agoKate WhannelPolitics reporterReutersDamien Egan first won his parliamentary seat in a by-election in 2024A visit by a Jewish MP to a school in their constituency was cancelled, after concerns were raised by local pro-Palestine campaigners.Palestine Solidarity Bristol said it had opposed the visit by Damien Egan, the Labour MP for Bristol North East, due to his support for Israel. The cancellation took place in September but was highlighted by Communities Secretary Steve Reed during a speech to the Jewish Labour Movement at the weekend.Reed did not name Egan but told the audience: \"I have a colleague who is Jewish, who has been banned from visiting a school and refused permission to visit a school in his own constituency, in case his presence inflames the teachers.\"That is an absolute outrage... and they will be called in, and they will be held to account for doing that, because you cannot have people with those kinds of attitudes teaching our children. \"You just can't have it.\"Egan confirmed the event had been cancelled but declined to comment further. In a statement to the Times, the school said it postponed Egan's appearance because of a planned protest near the school grounds, and said it had a concern it would clash with the end of the school day. The school rearranged a date for the MP's visit and contacted police for advice.The BBC has reached out to the school for comment. On 5 September, when the event had been due to go ahead, the Palestine Solidarity Bristol group published a social media post celebrating the cancellation. It said the event had been axed after \"concerns were raised by the National Education Union trade union staff group, parents and local constituents\".It said the cancellation was \"a clear message\" that politicians who support Israel's actions in Gaza \"are not welcome in our schools\". The National Education Union has been contacted for a comment. ",

    "body": "Mandelson makes personal apology for continuing Epstein friendship11 minutes agoNicholas Watt,Newsnight political editorandHarry SekulichBBCLord Mandelson has offered a personal apology to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein over his decision to maintain a friendship with the late paedophile after his conviction.The former cabinet minister had faced criticism after he offered a limited apology for system failures that had let women down, in a BBC interview on Sunday.But in a statement to BBC Newsnight on Monday, Lord Mandelson went further: \"Yesterday, I did not want to be held responsible for his [Jeffrey Epstein's] crimes of which I was ignorant, not indifferent, because of the lies he told me and so many others.\"I was wrong to believe him following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.\"The government dismissed Lord Mandelson as its ambassador to the US last September. Downing Street said \"new information\" had emerged relating to the former ambassador's friendship with Epstein. Emails revealed Lord Mandelson had been in contact with Epstein after the American financier's first conviction in 2008, where he advised Epstein to clear his name in a string of supportive messages.Epstein's first conviction was part of a plea bargain he reached in Florida. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to two charges, including soliciting girls as young as 14 for prostitution.In 2019, Epstein died in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In his first interview since his dismissal as ambassador on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Mandelson did not apologise for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, insisting that he would have done so if he were \"in any way complicit or culpable\".During the interview, Mandelson also said he believed he was \"kept separate\" from Epstein's sex life because he is gay and denied seeing young girls at Epstein's properties.But in his statement to BBC Newsnight, Lord Mandelson said: \"I was never culpable or complicit in his crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death.\"But his victims did know what he was doing, their voices were not heard and I am sorry I was amongst those who believed him over them.\"Watch: Mandelson initially declined on Sunday to apologise for Epstein emailsShortly before he was sacked as US ambassador, Lord Mandelson told the BBC he had \"relied on assurances of [Epstein's] innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false\".In a letter to embassy staff following his dismissal, he said: \"I continue to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein 20 years ago and the plight of his victims.\"Lord Mandelson's interview on Sunday drew criticism from government benches.One cabinet minister told BBC Newsnight that Mandelson was now \"persona non grata\". Another minister described his interview as \"horrendous and toe curling\".Labour peer Baroness Kennedy said it was \"shocking\" Lord Mandelson had not initially apologised.\"I'm glad he's come out tonight and at least now is saying that his preoccupation was that people should understand that he did not himself know and had been persuaded,\" she told Newsnight.\"Somebody like Peter Mandelson should have known better than to go on television and not to be apologising to those women who have suffered so terribly,\" she added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoThere's a mix of stories on Tuesday's front pages. The Daily Telegraph says it has seen previously redacted plans for China's mega embassy in London that show a \"hidden chamber\" to be built alongside a network of critical internet cables. The paper reports the underground complex could be a \"security risk\" as the prime minister is expected to approve the embassy later this month.The Financial Times reports on former US Federal Reserve chiefs uniting to hit back at the Department of Justice's criminal investigation into the head of the central bank, Jay Powell. The group have issued a joint statement calling the move an \"unprecedented attempt\" to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, the paper says.The Metro joins the Met police in a dawn drug raid in their lead story. The paper says the operation is part of a blitz on drug gangs which has helped drive down London's murder rate.The UK government is open to following Australia in a social media ban for under-16s amid fears over its harm to children, the i Paper reports. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall is understood to be open to the move and says she will be \"driven by the evidence\".The Daily Express leads on a report that the government's net zero project could cost taxpayers £9tn, far above official figures. The paper describes this costing as a \"fantasy\" and according a study from free-market think thank the Institute of Economic Affairs, officials have \"underestimated\" the price of heat pumps, renewables, and electric vehicles.In international news, UK special forces are being lined up to storm Russian shadow fleet vessels and could target hundreds of illegal oil tankers, the Times reports. Elsewhere, the top picture spot shows a fire burning on the streets of Iran as anti-regime protests stretch into their their third week.\"Fury over Labour payout\" to a detainee at Guantanamo Bay who was tortured by the CIA after the 11 September 2001 attacks, fills the Daily Mail's front page. It was revealed the government paid \"substantial\" compensation to Abu Zubaydah, who brought a legal claim against the UK on the basis that its intelligence services were \"complicit\" in his torture. The NHS is overspending by £164m a year on ADHD services, according to an investigation by the Guardian. The paper cites analysis that shows the total cost of ADHD services is expected to be \"more than double\" existing budgets, with an increasing amount going to unregulated private assessments. Elsewhere, Adolescence star Owen Cooper take centre stage with his Golden Globes win.The Sun warns that diesel fuel will start vanishing from pumps within four years in the push for net zero according to a new report. \"Bin Diesel\" is the paper's take, as it quotes experts who say the diesel market is at \"tipping point\" as demand plummets and more motorists turn to electric vehicles.Finally, the Daily Star features a story about ex-Master Chef presenter Gregg Wallace.The Daily Telegraph says it has uncovered previously unseen documents relating to the new \"super-embassy\" China is planning to build in central London. It says they show details of secret rooms including a \"concealed chamber\" which would sit directly alongside the fibre optic cables which transmit financial data to the City of London.The paper reports that Sir Keir Starmer is expected to approve the embassy before a visit to China later this month. The Times suggests that approval will come this week.The Times says its sources have confirmed that options are being drawn up for British special forces to storm Russian shadow fleet vessels at sea. The paper says elite soldiers could target hundreds of illegal oil tankers after the government identified a new legal basis for the raids, but no time frame has been given.The Guardian leads with an investigation showing that the NHS in England is overspending on services for ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, by £164m a year. The paper says an increasing amount is going to unregulated private assessments because demand has reached record levels. An NHS spokesperson tells the paper it commissioned an independent ADHD taskforce to consider how to improve care and service models.Research into the cost of the government's drive to reach net zero by 2050 features in several of the papers. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both carry details of an official report from the free-market think tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs which suggests that the figures involved in pursuing the policy will be much higher than the public has been told.The Daily Mail quotes the author of the report, Dr David Turver, as saying that \"fantasy assumptions\" have been made about the cost of renewables and low-carbon technologies. The Daily Express says the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has rejected the report, saying that the analysis assumes there are no costs associated with staying on the \"fossil fuel rollercoaster\".The i Paper reports that under-16s in the UK could be banned from social media \"within months\". The paper says the technology secretary, Liz Kendall, is understood to be \"open-minded\" about the restriction amid fears over how much harm social media does to children.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "The BBC will file a motion to dismiss Donald Trump's lawsuit over how his 6 January 2021 speech was edited in a Panorama documentary.The US president filed a $5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit in a Florida court last month, accusing the BBC of defamation and of violating a trade practices law.Court papers filed on Monday show the broadcaster will argue the Florida court lacks \"personal jurisdiction\" over the BBC, the court venue is \"improper\" and that Trump has \"failed to state a claim\".The BBC previously apologised to Trump over the edit, but rejected his demands for compensation and disagreed there was a basis for a defamation claim.The corporation will also argue that Panorama programme was not aired in the US and did not defame the US president.It will also assert that the president has not demonstrated that the documentary caused any actual damage to him, noting that he was re-elected after the programme aired and carried Florida with a commanding majority.Trump claims that the documentary aired on Britbox, which the BBC said is not correct.The BBC will add that Trump cannot plausibly allege that the documentary was published with \"actual malice\". It points out that the clip is some 15 seconds of an hour-long programme containing extensive coverage of his supporters and balanced coverage of his path to re-election.During Trump's speech on 6 January 2021, before a riot at the US Capitol, he told a crowd: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, a clip showed him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"The BBC previously acknowledged the edit had given \"the mistaken impression\" Trump had \"made a direct call for violent action\", but disagreed that there was basis for a defamation claim.An internal BBC memo leaked in November criticised how the speech was edited, and led to the resignations of the corporation's director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness.In Monday's court documents, the broadcaster also asked the court \"to stay all other discovery\" - a pre-trial process in which opposing parties exchange evidence and information - pending the decision on the motion.A proposed trial date in 2027 has been indicated should the case progress.",

    "body": "Joshua Cavallo - the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football - has alleged he was pushed out of his former club due to \"internal homophobia\".Cavallo, who recently joined semi-professional English outfit Stamford AFC after leaving Adelaide United in May last year, made global headlines in 2021 when he came out with the support of his Australian club.In an Instagram post on Tuesday, Cavallo alleged that the Adelaide United officials had afterwards sidelined him due to his sexuality, something a spokesperson for the club said it \"categorically rejects\".\"All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds,\" the club's statement read.In the Instagram post, Cavallo wrote that it had taken him a while to \"digest how my time at Adelaide United ended\" but said he was speaking out because fans deserve honesty.\"It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic. I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.While former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.",

    "body": "A high-stakes appeal by far-right French politician Marine Le Pen starts on Tuesday against a ruling that banned her from running for public office for five years.Le Pen, 57, was found guilty last year of embezzling EU funds and if the ban is upheld she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election. She insists she has not committed \"the slightest irregularity\". Ahead of the appeal, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be \"deeply worrying for democracy\". Bardella said he would not stand for president next year but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister.   The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer, well ahead of next year's presidential vote.Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, hired assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them.The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" that saw the embezzlement of €2.9m (£2.5m) worth of European funds.Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office \"with immediate effect\".If she loses her appeal she could face an even longer jail term.More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term.Addressing journalists on the eve of the appeal trial in the presence of Le Pen, Bardella said the RN leader would prove her innocence.\"It would be deeply worrying for democracy if the justice system were to deprive the French people of a presidential candidate, already qualified twice for the second round and now considered the undisputed favourite in the election,\" he said.Le Pen will be hoping the appeals court overturns the lower-court's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time.A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the \"immediate effect\" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict.A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline.And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation.With the presidential election expected around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements.

    "body": "Watch: \"This has to stop\" - Minnesota sues federal government over surge of ICE agentsThe US state of Minnesota has sued the Trump administration in an attempt to block a surge of federal immigration agents into the state.The lawsuit argues the deployment amounts to an unconstitutional \"federal invasion\". Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said immigration operations had upended life for millions and caused \"chaos and violence\".It comes after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city. The lawsuit asks a federal court to declare the deployment illegal. The Trump administration has described the legal action as \"baseless\".It has said said the agents are targeting undocumented migrants, and further agents are needed to ensure their safety during operations.In a news conference on Monday, Ellison said the deployment violated the state's \"sovereign authority to protect the health and wellbeing of every single person who lives within our borders\".Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey alleged that agents were illegally targeting people who they assumed to be immigrants based on racial profiling. He said their actions had led to an increase in calls to 911, and forced city police to work overtime to investigate incidents involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\"The unlawful deployment of thousands of armed, masked, and poorly trained federal agents is hurting Minnesota,\" Ellison said.He accused the Trump administration of \"persecuting the state of Minnesota because of our political views\". Democrats currently hold the governorship and control the state legislature.\"Keith Ellison made it abundantly clear today he is prioritising politics over public safety,\" Tricia McLaughlin from the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. \"This is a baseless lawsuit, and we look forward to proving that in court.\"During the news conference, prosecutors said they would attempt to get a court to issue a temporary restraining order to block the deployment as early as Tuesday.It comes as the US Department of Homeland Security says it plans to send more agents into the state as part of its Operation Metro Surge.The department says the deployment is necessary to combat illegal immigration and crime. According to recent estimates, around 2,000 agents have been deployed to Minnesota.Over the weekend, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told Fox News that \"hundreds more\" will be sent to the area \"in order to allow our ICE and our Border Patrol individuals that are working in Minneapolis to do so safely\".The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a similar lawsuit on Monday against what it called an \"organized bombardment\" and \"occupation\" by federal immigration agents.\"Uniformed, military-trained personnel, carrying semi-automatic firearms and military-grade weaponry, have rampaged for months through Chicago and the surrounding areas,\" the Illinois lawsuit states.The shooting of Good last week led to fierce debate over federal law enforcement operations in US cities. Federal officials allege that the 37-year-old was attempting to run over immigration agents with her car when she was shot. Local officials have disputed this, and say firing shots was not necessary. The FBI has said it will investigate the shooting. Local officials say they are being shut out of the federal investigation.",

It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.\"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCOne of these images is a real photo, while the other two have been digitally altered by Grok to change what I'm wearing. Can you tell which is real?Here's me, at the end of a pier in Dorset in the summer.Two of these images were generated using the artificial intelligence tool Grok, which is free to use and belongs to Elon Musk.It's pretty convincing. I've never worn the rather fetching yellow ski suit, or the red and blue jacket - the middle photo is the original - but I don't know how I could prove that if I needed to, because of those pictures.Of course, Grok is under fire for undressing rather than redressing women. And doing so without their consent.It made pictures of people in bikinis, or worse, when prompted by others. And shared the results in public on the social network X. There is also evidence it has generated sexualised images of children.Following days of outrage and condemnation, the UK's online regulator Ofcom has said it is urgently investigating whether Grok has broken British online safety laws.The government wants Ofcom to get on with it - and fast.But Ofcom will have to be thorough and follow its own processes if it wants to avoid criticism of attacking free speech, which has dogged the Online Safety Act from its earliest stages.Elon Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on the subject in recent days, which suggests even he realises how serious this all is. But he did fire off a post accusing the British government of seeking \"any excuse\" for censorship.Not everyone agrees that on this occasion, the defence is acceptable.\"AI undressing people in photos isn't free speech - it's abuse,\" says campaigner Ed Newton Rex.\"When every photo a woman posts of themselves on X immediately attracts public replies in which they've been stripped down to a bikini, something has gone very, very wrong.\"With all this in mind, Ofcom's investigation could take time, and a lot of back-and-forth – testing the patience of both politicians and the public.It's a major moment not only for Britain's Online Safety Act, but the regulator itself. It can't afford to get this wrong.Ofcom has previously been accused of lacking teeth. The Act, which was years in the making, only came fully into force last year. It has so far issued three relatively small fines for non-compliance, none of which have been paid.The Online Safety Act doesn't specifically mention AI products either. And while it is currently illegal to share intimate, non-consensual images, including deepfakes, it is not currently illegal to ask an AI tool to create them. That's about to change. The government will this week bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create these images.And the UK says it will amend another law - currently going through Parliament - which would make it illegal for companies to supply the tools designed to make them, too.These rules have been around for a while, they're not actually part of the Online Safety Act but a completely different piece of legislation called the Data (Use and Access) Act.They've not been brought into enforcement despite repeated announcements from the government over many months that they were incoming.Today's announcement shows a government determined to quell criticisms that regulation moves too slowly, by showing it can act quickly when it wants to.It's not just Grok that will be affected. A political bombshell?The new law that will be enforced this week could prove to be a headache for other owners of AI tools which are technically mostly capable of generating these images as well.And there are already questions around how on earth it will be enforced - Grok only came under the spotlight because it was publishing its output on X.If a tool is used privately by an individual user, they find a way around the guardrails and the resulting content is only shared with those who want to see it, how will it come to light?If X is found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue it with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater. It could even seek to block Grok or X in the UK. But this could also be a political bombshell.I sat at the AI Summit in Paris last year and watched Vice President JD Vance thunder that the US administration was \"getting tired\" of foreign countries attempting to regulate its tech companies.His audience, which included a huge number of world leaders, sat in stony silence.But the tech firms have a lot of firepower inside the White House – and several of them have also invested billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the UK. Can the country afford to fall out with them?",

    "body": "15 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe proposed new embassy at Royal Mint Court would be the biggest in EuropeA group of Labour MPs have urged the government to reject China's controversial plan to build a mega embassy in London, just days before the deadline for the decision.In a letter to Communities Secretary Steve Reed, the nine MPs raise security concerns about the proposed site, while warning it would be used to \"step up intimidation\" against dissidents.It come as local residents, who live in flats that are part of Royal Mint Court which Beijing wants to develop, say they are already gearing up to bring a legal challenge if Reed approves the project.Downing Street has argued consolidating China's diplomatic premises into a single site would have security advantages for the UK.The government has said a decision will be made by 20 January and local residents have been told there will be no further delay.Sir Keir Starmer has been planning a trip to China for early this year, which would be the first by a British Prime Minister since 2018. Approval for the London embassy has long been a priority for China's government, which bought the site for £255m in 2018.In their letter, the MPs, who say they represent \"the breadth and depth of our party\", write that \"the concerns surrounding the proposed site remain significant and unresolved\".The site, opposite the Tower of London and once home to the Royal Mint, would be the biggest embassy any country has in Europe.Among the issues the MPs highlight are \"the recent track record of Chinese espionage cases, interference activities, and issuing of bounties against UK-based Hong Kongers\", as well as \"the fact that this embassy would sit above sensitive infrastructure critical to both the UK's economic and national security\".One of the signatories, Sarah Champion, who sits on parliament's Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy has, in the past, had Chinese spyware found on her parliamentary computer.\"I'm hugely concerned by the level and range of security risks raised over the embassy, and I'm not reassured that they're being taken seriously,\" she told the BBC.Several of the MPs who signed the letter, including Emily Darlington, MP for Milton Keynes Central, James Naish, MP for Rushcliffe, and Mark Sewards, MP for Leeds South West and Morely, have spoken out in the past about \"transnational repression\" by China seeking to silence critics abroad, including people from Hong Kong who have sought sanctuary in the UK.In their letter the MPs say \"an embassy of this size, in such a strategic position, would be used to step up intimidation against diaspora and dissidents\". \"Should this application be approved, we would feel unable to reassure our constituents that we are doing everything possible to protect them on British soil,\" they add.Among the other signatories, Phil Brickell, MP for Bolton West, Marie Rimmer, MP for St Helens South and Whiston, and Alex Sobel, MP for Leeds Central and Headingley, have all previously raised the case of Jimmy Lai, a British citizen who is a former Hong Kong newspaper tycoon and one of the territory's highest profile pro-democracy figures. He is facing a possible life sentence after being found guilty of \"conspiracy to collude with foreign forces\" under a controversial security law imposed on Hong Kong by China.Sobel told the BBC, his concerns centred on national security and China's ability to use the embassy site to \"hack or disrupt\" communications to the City of London, as well as concerns about Lai.\"We shouldn't approve the plan before we see Jimmy Lai released and put on a plane to the UK. Our diplomacy should be more robust,\" he said.The letter was organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, (IPAC) an international group which seeks to campaign against what it sees as threats posed by China.BBC visited the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyDowning Street has said the UK would not allow China to \"interfere in our sovereign affairs\" but has insisted approving the new London embassy would \"clearly bring security advantages for the UK\".China has agreed to close more than half a dozen sites it currently uses as diplomatic premises in London and consolidate its activities at Royal Mint Court if gets approved.It is understood UK security services have scrutinised China's proposal for its new embassy and not objected to it.At the same time, the UK is waiting for its own £100m plan to redevelop the British Embassy in Beijing to be approved by China's authorities.The applications are not connected.But the BBC has seen a letter obtained by IPAC, which was written by Boris Johnson in 2018 when he was foreign secretary, addressed to China's Foreign Minister and State Councillor, Wang Yi.In it Johnson said he welcomed \"China's larges overseas diplomatic investment\" at Royal Mint Court and is happy for it to be \"designated as diplomatic premises\", adding that \"the re-development of our Embassy in Beijing will be one of our largest overseas diplomatic investments\".\"Once both these projects are complete, they will be bold expressions of the strength of UK-China bilateral relations,\" he said.\"I am committed, as I am convinced you are, to ensuring that our projects develop alongside each other.\"The UK Embassy in Beijing was established on its current site in 1959. It is understood to be in urgent need of redevelopment as it is considered by diplomats to be unsuitable for modern needs .In London, China's planning application will be considered by the environment secretary, with advice from officials. He alone will take the final decision in the coming days.Mark Nygate, of the Royal Mint Court Residents' Association, told the BBC: \"If the government grants the application then the residents plan to challenge.\"While he said residents could not appoint legal representation until the decision is made, Nygate said they had already seen \"legal opinions that also give us a good starting point for our challenge\".",

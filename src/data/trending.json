    "body": "16 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentBBCVladimir Putin may have a reputation among some as a ruthless autocrat, a master manipulator of the international scene. But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". AFP via Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with RussiaHe could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind? And what else could Ukraine, Europe and even China, do differently?Could Europe do more?At the moment, the continent is preparing for a ceasefire. Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".WPA Pool/Getty ImagesZelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday. (Pictured: Starmer with Zelensky, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Donald Tusk)Mr Giles said: \"The only thing that will unarguably, undeniably stop Russian aggression is the presence of sufficiently strong western forces where Russia wants to attack, and the demonstrated will and resolve that they will be used to defend.\"This strategy would of course come with huge political difficulty - with some voters in western Europe unwilling to risk a confrontation with Russia.Few analysts expect Ukraine to reverse the tide and make actual territorial gains of its own. Having spent several weeks in Ukraine recently, I heard no mention of any Spring offensive, only the need to slow Russia's advance and increase the price it pays in blood and treasure.Some western diplomats claim Russia's generals are lying to the Russian president, pretending the situation on the ground is better than it is - adding to what they see as a deliberate strategy to exaggerate Russian gains, designed to suggest Ukraine is on the back foot and should thus sue for peace.According to Thomas Graham in Foreign Affairs, in this year, Russia has seized only 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded.AFP via Getty Images'It is remarkable they [Ukraine] have held off for so long, not least fighting with one hand behind their back,' says Fiona HillFiona Hill, senior fellow at the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution, who served on Trump's national security council during his first term, says the biggest thing Putin has in his favour is that many people believe Ukraine is losing. \"Everyone is talking of Ukraine as the loser when it now has the most potent military in Europe,\" she says. \"Just think what they have done to Russia. It is remarkable they have held off for so long not least fighting with one hand behind their back.\"Trade, sanctions and Russia's economyThen there's the lever of sanctions. Certainly, Russia's economy is suffering. Inflation at 8%, interest rates 16%, growth slowed, budget deficits soaring, real incomes plunging, consumer taxes rising. A report for the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform says Russia's war economy is running out of time. \"The Russian economy is substantially less able to finance the war than it was at the beginning of it in 2022,\" the authors say.But so far none of this appears to have changed much Kremlin thinking, not least because businesses have found ways of evading restrictions, such as transporting oil on unregistered ghost ships.Sputnik/Alexander Kazakov/Pool via ReutersIn this year alone, Russia has seized 1% of Ukrainian territory at a cost of more than 200,000 dead and wounded, according to Thomas Graham in Foreign AffairsTom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at Rusi, said western messaging about sanctions was convoluted and there were too many loopholes. Russia would, he said, work around recent US sanctions on two Russian oil giants, Lukoil and Rosneft, just by re-labelling the exported oil as coming from non-sanctioned companies.Mr Keatinge said if the West really wanted to hurt Russia's war economy, it would embargo all Russian oil and fully implement secondary sanctions on countries that still buy it. \"We need to stop being cute and go full embargo,\" he said. \"We need to take our implementation of sanctions as seriously as the Kremlin takes circumvention.\"In theory, sanctions could also affect Russian public opinion. In October, a survey by the state-run Public Opinion Research Centre (VCIOM) said 56% of respondents said they felt \"very tired\" of the conflict, up from 47% last year. But the consensus among Kremlinologists is that much of the Russian public remains supportive of Putin's strategy. ReutersThe Ukrainian president arrived in Berlin on Sunday for peace talks with Witkoff and Friedrich Merz (Trump and Zelensky pictured on a previous occasion)The European Union could agree to use about €200bn (£176bn) of frozen Russian assets to generate a so-called \"reparation loan\" for Ukraine. The latest European Commission proposal is to raise €90bn (£79bn) over two years.In Kyiv, officials are already banking on getting the cash. But still the EU hesitates. Belgium, where the bulk of the Russian assets are held, has long feared being sued by Russia - and on Friday, the Russian Central Bank announced legal action against Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court.Belgium says it will not agree the loan unless legal and financial risks are shared more explicitly with other EU members. France has concerns, such is its own vast debts, and fears exploiting the frozen assets could undermine the stability of the eurozone.EU leaders will make a further attempt to agree a deal when they meet in Brussels on 18 December for their final summit before Christmas. But diplomats say there is no guarantee of success.There is also disagreement over what the cash should be used for: keeping Ukraine's state solvent now or paying for its reconstruction after the war.Ukraine's conscription questionAs for Ukraine, it could mobilise more of its armed forces.It remains the second-biggest army in Europe (behind Russia), and the most technically advanced - but it is nonetheless struggling to defend an 800-mile frontline. After almost four years of war, many soldiers are exhausted and desertion rates are rising.Getty ImagesUkraine is defending itself against repeated Russian air attacksArmy recruiters are finding it harder to fill gaps as some younger men hide from press gangs or flee the country. But Ukraine could widen its conscription laws. Currently only men aged 25 to 60 must be available to fight. This is a deliberate strategy by Kyiv to manage Ukraine's demographic challenges; a country with a low birth rate and millions living abroad cannot afford to lose what have been dubbed \"the fathers of the future\".This puzzles outsiders. \"I find it incredible that Ukraine has not mobilised its young people,\" one senior UK military figure told me. \"I think Ukraine must be one of the only countries in history facing an existential threat that has not thrown its mad 20-year-olds into the fight.\"Fiona Hill said Ukraine had simply learned the lesson of history and the devastating impact World War One had on 20th Century European empires, which declined after failing to rediscover the population growth that had fuelled their economic rise. \"Ukraine is just thinking of their demographic [future].\"Strikes, diplomacy and TrumpIf Ukraine could import and manufacture more long-range missiles, it could hit Russia harder and deeper.This year it stepped up its air strikes on targets both in occupied territory and the Russian Federation. Earlier this month Ukraine's military commanders told Radio Liberty they had hit more than 50 fuel and military-industrial infrastructure facilities in Russia during the autumn.Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, says some Russians experienced fuel shortages earlier this year. \"By late October, Ukrainian drones had hit more than half of Russia's thirty-eight major refineries at least once.\"Production outages spread across multiple regions, and some Russian gas stations began rationing fuel.\"But would more deep strikes on Russia make an impact, when both the Kremlin and public opinion in Russia seem indifferent? AFP via Getty ImagesAs well as defending its territory, Ukraine has stepped up air strikes in the Russian federationMick Ryan, former Australian major general and now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says deep strikes are not a magic bullet. \"They are an extraordinarily important military endeavour, but insufficient by themselves to force Putin to the negotiating table or to win the war.\"Dr Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow in military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said more deep strikes would certainly damage Russia's energy and military infrastructure, as well as using up its air defence missiles. But he warned the tactic could be counterproductive. \"It could reinforce the argument the Russian leadership makes that an independent Ukraine poses a massive military threat,\" he said.More from InDepthThere's also - still - a diplomatic route.Some analysts argue that if Putin is offered a way out of the war, he may choose it.The theory goes like this: a deal is agreed that allows both sides to claim victory. Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition. Compromises all round. But the deal would require the US to engage hard with Russia, setting up negotiating teams, using its power to drive through agreement.\"The United States… needs to deploy its formidable psychological leverage it possesses over Russia,\" Thomas Graham argues. \"One cannot overstate the role the United States – and Trump personally – plays in validating Russia as a great power and Putin as a global leader.\"China's leverageThe wild card is China. President Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens to. When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow. So the question is whether President Xi would be willing to apply any leverage off his own bat.ShutterstockPresident Xi Jinping is one of the few world leaders Putin listens toAt the moment China seems happy for the US to be distracted, for transatlantic allies to be divided, and for the rest of the world to view China as a source of stability. But if Russia's invasion escalated, if global markets were disrupted, if the US applied secondary sanctions on China in punishment for its consumption of cheap Russian energy, then the thinking in Beijing might change.For now though, Putin believes he is sitting pretty, with time on his side. The longer this conflict goes on, analysts say, the more Ukrainian morale will fall, the more divided its allies will become, and the more territory Russia will gain in Donetsk. \"Either we liberate these territories by force of arms or Ukrainian troops leave these territories,\" Putin said last week.\"Nothing will change his position,\" Fiona Hill told me. \"Unless he exits stage left. Putin is betting right now that he can keep this going for long enough that circumstances play out to his advantage.\"Top picture credit: Reuters BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

The complainant then made their complaint to Ofcom.\"Parents and carers would have accessed Diary of a Wimpy Kid on the basis that it was appropriate for their children to view, potentially unaccompanied by an adult (as had the complainant in this case).\"",

    "body": "The Louvre museum in Paris was forced to close on Monday as its employees went on strike over working conditions and pay, leaving thousands of would-be visitors disappointed.The walkout at the world's most visited museum in the French capital was earlier backed unanimously by some 400 staff, trade unions announced.They said understaffed museum workers were being required to cope with ever increasing flows of people. The management did not comment immediately.Nearly two months ago burglars stole French crown jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring security gaps. And last week a water leak in the museum damaged hundreds of books.In their strike notice to Culture Minister Rachida Dati, the CFDT, CGT and Sud unions pointed to \"deteriorating working conditions\" and \"insufficient resources\" at the Louvre.\"We need a change of approach... regarding the priorities and urgent needs\" of the museum, CGT representative Christian Galani was quoted as saying by BFMTV news website.The Louvre's reception and security sector, he said, had \"lost 200 full-time equivalent positions in the space of 15 years, while visitor numbers have increased by half\".Some people had already purchased tickets for Monday.\"I'm very disappointed because the Louvre was the main reason for our visit in Paris, because we wanted to see the Mona Lisa,\" Minsoo Kim, who travelled from Seoul with his wife for their honeymoon, told AFP news agency.Natalia Brown, a Londoner, said she was also disappointed. \"At the same time, I understand why they're doing it, it's just unfortunate timing for us,\" she added.The unions said Louvre employees would gather on Wednesday morning to decide what to do next.The museum - which is closed on Tuesdays for maintenance - said it welcomed 8.7 million visitors in 2024.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThis week's five-day doctor strike in England will go ahead despite a new offer from the government.The British Medical Association said 83% of its members had voted to continue with the walkout in an online poll over the weekend. Turnout was 65%.The union agreed to the snap poll last week after the government came forward with a fresh deal which included increasing speciality training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.The strike by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, is due to start at 07:00 on Wednesday with Health Secretary Wes Streeting warning it was \"irresponsible and dangerous\" given the pressure hospitals are under with flu.The offer did not include any promises on pay – Streeting has maintained he will not negotiate on that after resident doctors pay has been increased by nearly 30% in the past three years.The union argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Streeting said the pay demands were \"fantasy\".And he added: \"The BMA has chosen Christmas strikes to inflict damage on the NHS at the moment of maximum danger. These strikes are self-indulgent, irresponsible and dangerous.\"He said he hoped resident doctors would still go to work, saying there was a different magnitude of risk striking at this moment.Flu pressuresData shows the number of patients in hospital with flu had risen by more than 50% in a week, topping 2,600 in the first week of December, with officials warning there is still no sign of it peaking yet.Flu came early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season.The strain that is circulating is H3N2, which tends to cause more severe illness, and it has mutated somewhat with fears people may have less immunity.This will be the 14th strike in the long-running dispute which began in March 2023.Resident doctors, which represent nearly half the medical workforce, will walk out of both emergency and non-urgent care. Senior doctors will be drafted in to provide cover.BMA resident doctor leader Dr Jack Fletcher said the \"resounding response\" should leave the health secretary in no doubt about how badly he has just fumbled his opportunity to end industrial action. \"Tens of thousands of front-line doctors have come together to say 'no' to what is clearly too little, too late,\" he added.He said any solution had to address pay.But he added the union was \"committed to ensuring patient safety\" and would be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strike to address concerns as they arise.Rory Deighton, of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said: \"It's bitterly disappointing that the BMA has rejected this offer and chosen to continue with hugely disruptive strikes. \"These strikes come at the worst possible time, with rapidly rising flu levels putting huge strain on hospitals.\"If BMA members had voted in not to continue with this week's strike, that would then have triggered a new survey on the actual deal that the government had put forward last week.Only if they voted in favour of that would the dispute have ended.",

    "body": "Give newborns automatic library cards, authors urge1 hour agoKerena CobbinaGetty ImagesA group of leading authors are calling for every newborn baby to be signed up to a library card automatically at birth. Writers including Sir Philip Pullman, Richard Osman and Joanne Harris have backed a proposal by think tank the Cultural Policy Unit (CPU), who say a universal, lifelong membership issued at birth would boost literacy.\"A lot of people still feel that [libraries are] not for them,\" but automatically giving out cards could show that \"every single young child that's born is welcome,\" Kate Mosse told BBC Radio 4 Today.CPU director Alison Cole said they want to \"integrate\" the library cards directly with health visitors, midwives, and schools to ensure all families have access.The think tank has proposed the creation of a \"National Library Card\" to ensure every citizen is connected to their library network. It said the plan will boost literacy and reading habits, and expose families to parenting support, community and cultural experiences at libraries.Membership would be linked directly to birth registration, instead of signing up online and bringing proof of address or ID to a local library. Award-winning novelist Mosse, known for her book Labyrinth, said being automatically given library membership at birth would make a difference.\"If it is part of your welcome pack for your child to our society, then it is much more likely families who haven't necessarily had a library card... will think that's for me too...,\" she told Today programme.\"I take my grandchildren, who are three and six months to the local library for story time. It helps with isolation, it will make an enormous difference to young parents who maybe don't have a support network near them.\"It just says its something you could do and it puts it in people's minds, and that's why it could be transformational... it fits very well with the government's mission of intervention in the early years.\"Sir Philip said: \"It's a brilliant and optimistic plan, and I hope very much it will come into existence as soon as possible\". 'Books are for babies as well'Louie Stowell, author of children's books Loki, described the scheme as a  \"fantastic idea\". \"It reminds everyone that books are for babies as well as older children - not everyone knows that babies can enjoy and benefit from being read to from birth,\" she told BBC News. \"It also normalises library use and, even if the admin involved in getting a library card isn't vast, it's one more thing to do when you're juggling nappies and sleepless nights.\"But the British Book Awards winner author stressed the scheme would need to be paired with funding for libraries with fully-trained librarians. \"There's no point signing babies up for libraries that don't exist,\" she added.A CPU report estimates the scheme would cost between £14m to £22m annually and it proposes it as a joint Department for Education and Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) initiative. A spokesperson for DCMS, when asked about the proposal, said: \"[Libraries] are trusted, free-to-use transformational places at the heart of their communities that can help boost children's speech and language and social development and engender a love of reading from the earliest stages of life onwards.\"Public libraries are funded and run by local authorities and each local authority is responsible for determining how best to meet the needs of its communities.\"We encourage library services to promote their services to families from the earliest stages of a child's life.\"",

He was shot multiple times and has since undergone surgery for his wounds.His father told BBC Arabic: \"Ahmed was driven by his sentiment, conscience and humanity.\"The fruit shop owner and father of two has been hailed as a hero for intervening in the shooting, which killed 15 people and left dozens injured at an event to celebrate Hanukkah on Sunday.Mr Ahmed was meeting a friend for coffee in the area when the attack unfolded, his father said.His son did not hesitate to intervene and \"rushed forward, stopped the gunman, and snatched his weapon\".The family said they felt immense pride in Mr Ahmed, who was now in a stable condition and awaiting further treatment for wounds to his shoulder and hand.Speaking from Syria, where Mr Ahmed was born and raised, his uncle remarked: \"He made us proud - our village, Syria, all Muslims and the entire world.\"Chris Minns/FacebookChris Minns met Mr Ahmed after the attack and said it had been an \"honour\" to thank himNew South Wales Premier Chris Minns shared a picture of himself and Mr Ahmed late on Monday and described him as a \"real-life hero\".\"His incredible bravery no doubt saved countless lives when he disarmed a terrorist at enormous personal risk,\" he wrote on Facebook.He said it had been an honour to spend time with Mr Ahmed and \"to pass on the thanks of people across NSW\".\"There is no doubt that more lives would have been lost if not for Ahmed's selfless courage.\"Meanwhile, a US billionaire donated A$99,999 (US$ 65,000; £49,000) to Mr Ahmed, calling him a \"brave hero\".William Ackman, the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, made the top donation to a GoFundMe for Mr Ahmed, which had raised more than $1m by late Monday.Mr Ahmed managed to wrestle the gun from the attacker in the struggle The footage of Mr Ahmed's intervention was shared widely online.It shows one of the gunmen standing behind a palm tree near a small pedestrian bridge, aiming and shooting his gun towards a target out of sight.Mr Ahmed, who was hiding behind a parked car, is seen leaping out at the attacker and tackling him.He manages to wrestle the gun from the attacker, pushes him to the ground and points the gun towards him. The attacker begins to retreat back to the bridge.Mr Ahmed then lowers the weapon and raises one hand in the air, appearing to show police he was not one of the shooters.The same attacker is later seen on the bridge picking up another weapon and firing again.Another gunman also continues firing from the bridge. It is unclear who or what they are aiming at.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday: \"We have seen Australians today run towards danger in order to help others.\"These Australians are heroes, and their bravery has saved lives.\"Speaking at a White House Christmas reception, US President Donald Trump also praised Mr Ahmed, saying he had \"great respect\" for him. \"It's been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,\" he said. Police say that the two shooters involved were a father and son aged 50 and 24. They have been named by local media as Sajid Akram and son Naveed Akram.Sajid Akram died at the scene while his son remains in hospital in critical condition.",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterThe Spanish government has fined property rentals giant Airbnb €64m (£56m) for advertising unlicensed apartments.It also said that some of the properties advertised in the popular tourist destination were banned from being rented.The fine means that Airbnb has to withdraw the adverts promoting unlicensed properties. Although the Consumer Affairs Ministry said the fine cannot be appealed, Airbnb said it intends to challenge it in court. Spain, one of the most visited countries in the world, has a buoyant tourism economy but that has fuelled concerns about unaffordable housing, as high demand from visitors raises the price of housing, pushing local people out of the market.\"There are thousands of families who are living on the edge due to housing, while a few get rich with business models that expel people from their homes,\" said Spain's consumer rights minister Pablo Bustinduy in a statement.But Airbnb said in a statement that it was \"confident that the Ministry of Consumer Affairs' actions are contrary to applicable regulations in Spain\".A spokesperson added that since short-term rental regulations in Spain changed in July, Airbnb was \"closely collaborating with Spain's Ministry of Housing to support the enforcement of the new national registration system\".Like many countries, Spain's government is concerned about how short-term holiday lets can change a neighbourhood, fuelled by a transient population of holiday-goers.The country has been fighting a battle with thousands of Airbnb listings, banning them and clamping down on how many properties the firm can advertise. In May, there were demonstrations against the firm ahead of the busy summer season.Spain's government said 65,122 adverts on Airbnb breached consumer rules, including promotion of properties that were not licensed to be rented, and properties whose licence number did not match with those on official registers.Writing on social network Bluesky, Mr Bustinduy said: \"We'll prove it as many times as necessary: no company, no matter how big or powerful, is above the law. Even less so when it comes to housing.\"Globally, several popular tourist cities place heavy restriction on Airbnb, including Barcelona, New York, Berlin, Paris and even San Francisco, where Airbnb was founded.The tech firm started up in 2007 but became hugely popular around 2014, as tourists looked for cheap accommodation without the tax costs imposed on hotels.Users swelled as anybody could become a \"host\" and make some extra cash from renting out their spare room - though many major cities have since placed limits on these types of rentals, as complaints of noisy house parties and absent hosts became an issue.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondent, SantiagoReutersSupporters of José Antonio Kast celebrated his victoryChile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven. But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling. However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an \"emergency government\" would not mean \"authoritarianism\". Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama. Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting. In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela. The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign. He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".Jeremías Alonso supported José Antonio Kast in the electionKast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity. Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult. Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited. Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.Gabriel, who is from Venezuela, felt hurt by comments diners made about migrantsFor irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's \"very, very bad economic situation\".He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request. His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. \"I'm basically a ghost here,\" he says.While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.\"Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,\" he said.He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.\"It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.\"He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants. With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business. Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries. Carlos Alberto Cossio says migrant workers are key to his businessHe says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds. Expelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.\"Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",

    "body": "Talks between Ukraine and the US aimed at reaching a peace deal with Russia are continuing in Berlin for a second day.Zelensky and his chief negotiator Rustem Umerov met US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner for five hours on Sunday, joined by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. \"A lot of progress was made,\" a US readout said. The same team resumed talks on Monday morning.Ahead of the start of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelensky signalled he would give up ambitions to join Nato in exchange for security guarantees.Recognising that \"some partners from the US and Europe\" did not support Ukraine's bid for Nato membership, Zelensky said he was instead seeking strong security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection.\"And this is already a compromise on our part,\" he said on Sunday.Witkoff has travelled to Moscow to hold talks with Vladimir Putin on several occasions, but Sunday's meeting at the chancellery in Berlin was the first time he met Zelensky. Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Alexus Grynkewich was also present at the talks.Several European leaders as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening.At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal presented to the US by Ukraine last week to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.For Russia, Kyiv's membership of Nato is a red line, and Moscow has repeatedly demanded that any ambitions for Ukraine to join the alliance are shelved forever. \"This issue is one of the cornerstones and requires special discussion,\" said the Kremlin on Monday.The US too has repeatedly stated it does not want Ukraine to be part of Nato. But Kyiv fears that a peace deal without watertight security guarantees would fail to detract Russia from attacking again.Before the talks began, Zelensky also addressed the thorny issue of sovereignty over the eastern region of the Donbas, which Russia mostly occupies and which it wants Kyiv to hand over in their entirety.The Ukrainian president said that while he was open to freezing the conflict along the current front line he was not prepared to have his troops withdraw from the percentage of the Donbas they still hold - unless Russian forces did the same in the areas they control. For it to be a fair arrangement Russia would have to withdraw the same distance, Zelensky said. This matter was \"extremely sensitive and heated,\" he added.Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide us with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. Over the weekend more than a million households in Ukraine were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". \"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.",

    "body": "2 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesAt first glance, my emails are polite and warm, after all \"I'm just checking\" in on a deadline but \"no worries either way\". However, a closer look reveals my messages are punctuated by unnecessary apologies, smiley faces, exclamation marks and even kisses.I like to think I'm being friendly and approachable, but according to experts, these linguistic habits may be quietly undermining how seriously I'm taken at work.Careers coach Hannah Salton and etiquette coach William Hanson explain why so many of us write like this and the impact it could be having on how we're perceived, and even promoted at work. Is your punctuation extra?\"Thanks very much!\" I've replied to many an email - my punctuation may be extra but a full stop feels blunt.People use exclamation marks to show \"positivity and enthusiasm,\" says Hannah.Women use them three times more often than men, a recent study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology found.She thinks that’s likely down to the idea that \"women are often judged more harshly than men when they are direct and are called bossy and other gendered negative words\". And while a single exclamation mark isn't the problem the cumulative effect can be, warns Hannah. “If it looks fake or like it's covering up insecurity it could impact credibility,” she explains.Would you kiss them in real life?Written communication is notoriously easy to misread, which is why many of us insert an emoji as a picture of our warmth or humour.But etiquette coach William Hanson warns this can backfire. \"One emoji can mean different things to different people or something entirely unintended,\" he says.\"It would be better if people used words and a good command of English,\" he advises.Emojis can have an \"infantile connotation\" which could lead to people perceiving you as younger, less senior, capable or responsible, he says.\"I would not put an emoji in an email,\" he says. \"You can be friendly in your writing and remain professional at the same time.\" And when it comes to signing off with a kiss, he says: \"I would never put a kiss on the end of an email unless I would kiss them on the cheek in real life.\" Softening language can dilute authority\"Just checking that you're following me and this all makes sense?\"Emails containing reassurance checkers can be self-deprecating, Hannah says, adding that over time, that tone can subtly shape how someone is perceived.\"As a manager, it's a difficult balance of being liked and respected and if you're not direct, there's a risk of creating an impression of being less capable,\" she says.\"There are definitely times where communicating in an overly apologetic or overly measured way can make you come across as less impactful.\" \"A lot of it is unconscious,\" Hannah says. \"No one reads an email and thinks 'oh, they don't back themselves', it's more subtle than that.\"But if you're consistently communicating in a people-pleasing way, that can build up an impression of someone who doesn't back themselves, or who is potentially less competent.\"What to cut out of your emailsHere are some of the things you might want to consider losing to appear more professional, our experts suggest:Qualifying words such as \"just\" (\"just checking\", \"just wondering\")Pre-emptive apologies like \"sorry to bother you\" or \"I'm sure you're really busy but…\"Reassurance checkers such as \"does that make sense?\", \"hope that's ok\" or \"no worries either way\"Exclamation marksEmojisKisses or overly warm sign-offsHannah and William stress it's not about stripping all warmth or personality from professional communication. \"Personal style is important,\" Hannah says. \"Showcasing personality at work is not a bad thing. You don't want to feel like you have to filter everything you write and remove any personality from it.\"But at the same time you shouldn't use certain words and symbols \"as a tool to be liked\". A practical way to spot and reduce these habits without losing personality is to pay attention to the emails you receive and notice how different styles make you feel - what sounds clear, confident or reassuring, and what feels excessive, she says.Salton says AI tools can also be useful for reviewing drafts and removing excess filler or qualifier words.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMark SavageMusic correspondentGetty ImagesKylie Minogue has had seven UK number one singles - but never at Christmas Pop star Kylie Minogue is leading a three-way race for this year's Christmas number one, says the Official Charts Company.Her festive single XMAS is currently 7,000 units ahead of the nearest competitor, Wham's Last Christmas - which has topped the charts for the last two years.In third place, and only 231 sales behind Wham, is the charity single Lullaby, by Together For Palestine - a supergroup featuring Bastille's Dan Smith, Celeste, Neneh Cherry, Nadine Shah, Brian Eno and Little Mix's Leigh-Anne Pinnock among others.If Kylie maintains her lead, XMAS would become her first number one single since Slow in 2003. \"I think I'd cry,\" she told BBC News.\"It's been an unbelievable year, so that would be the cherry on top.\"Kylie's song, which she performed on Strictly Come Dancing on Sunday night, comes complete with a dance routine spelling out the letters X-M-A-S, essentially making it a yuletide YMCA.More importantly in chart terms, it's an Amazon exclusive. That means it's prominently placed on the playlists you hear when you ask Amazon-branded smart speakers to play Christmas music - and every one of those streams counts towards the chart.Kylie's Christmas jigsawXMAS is a brand new song, recorded for the 10th anniversary edition of the star's Kylie Christmas album, which topped the album charts last week.It dates back to the original recording sessions, but never quite made the cut. Kylie told the BBC it had always bothered her that the song wasn't finished.\"It's not something I've constantly thought about, but it's had a place in my mind. \"As the years went by, I kept thinking someone else was going to release a song called Xmas - and it would have been so annoying that I didn't get it done in time.\"It's the only song that's ever lived with me this long.\"However, it's not the first time that Kylie's been in the running for the festive top spot: In 1988, Especially For You was a close runner-up to Cliff Richard's Mistletoe and Wine. However, no matter what happens, the star won't be in the UK to celebrate.\"I'm heading home,\" she told BBC News. \"I'm looking forward to spending time with my family and, you know, obsessing over a jigsaw with the cricket on. \"That's about the level I want to get to.\"Getty ImagesLast Christmas was denied the top spot in 1984 by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas, and eventually rose to number one in 2021Wham's Last Christmas is the current number one single; and it's huge streaming numbers could allow the band to hold on to the top spot.If they do, Last Christmas will make history as the first ever song to reach Christmas number one three times.Meanwhile, the UK's best-selling song of the weekend was Together For Palestine's charity single, which will raise funds for aid for people in Gaza. It's based on the traditional Palestinian folk song Yamma Mwel El Hawa (Mama, Sing to the Wind), with new English lyrics written by Peter Gabriel.\"The song's really been a part of my life since an early age,\" says Nai Barghouti, a Palestinian singer who features on the track.\"I remember recording it for the first time when I was 11 years old, and it's been going a lot of places with me since then. \"The lyrics are always a strong confirmation of what it means to be Palestinian - a never-ending sense of resilience, defiance, beauty, dignity and hope.\"Getting into the Christmas chart, she says, would represent \"a small beam of light in such darkness\".The song has sold just under 10,000 copies so far according to Official Charts Company data. However, it has yet to make Spotify's Top 100 - which means it may fall down the rankings as the week progresses and streams for other contenders accumulate.Getty ImagesFairytale of New York is another perennial favouriteThose songs include Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You (currently predicted to land at number four) and The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl's Fairytale of New York (which is at five).Fairytale is the third best-selling single of the week thanks to a limited-edition zoetrope vinyl, which was released on Friday. The song has famously achieved every position in the Top 20 except for number one; and strong streaming numbers could help it leapfrog the competition.Less than 10,000 \"sales\" separate the top five, according to the Official Charts Company.\"However, with this also being preliminary data only, expect the picture to evolve as more streaming data arrives throughout the week.\"",

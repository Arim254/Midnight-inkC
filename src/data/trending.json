Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "1 hour agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterGetty ImagesWild fluctuations in the price of gold continued on Wednesday as geopolitical tensions reignited after the US downed an Iranian drone.The precious metal, which is seen as a so-called \"safe haven\" for investors in times of uncertainty, shot back above $5,000 (£3,650) an ounce following days of sharp falls. Gold prices had been propelled to record highs by rapid changes in US trade policy, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and conflict and central banks increasing their purchases of bullion.Wednesday's jump, to $5,061 per ounce,  left the price of gold around 80% higher than the same time a year ago.A US military spokesman confirmed the Iranian drone had been shot down after it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's incident.Gold prices peaked at $5,500 in January but last Friday tumbled after US President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as chair of the Federal Reserve. Warsh is viewed by investors as a relatively safe pick, calming concerns about the independence of the central bank following attacks by Trump against the current chair Jerome Powell and the pace of interest rate cuts. Friday's drop, which saw the gold price fall 9%, was its biggest one-day decline since 1983.Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the rise in the gold price is \"mostly fuelled by speculators buying the dip\".\"The slump proved too enticing to ignore and the fundamental drivers of the metal are intact,\" she said.But she warned that there is likely to be more volatility to come, with interest rate decisions in the US, mid-term elections in November and continuing tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East.Silver has also recovered some losses seen over recent says with prices climbing by around 5% to $92 an ounce on Wednesday. The metal saw far more dramatic falls than gold after January's surge, plunging by 27% in a single day on Friday.But, despite being well off January's peak of over $120, silver is still worth almost three times what it was this time a year ago.",

    "body": "12 hours agoEmily HoltAngie EmeryAngie had a huge job tackling decades worth of family itemsWe all accumulate stuff over the years that can make our homes feel cluttered.But reclaiming the space with a clear out can feel overwhelming - it's hard to let go of items which hold sentimental value.Angie, Sarah, Susan and Jenni have all recently tackled the task and share their top tips for how they did it with BBC You and Yours.I got my daughter-in-law to helpAngie EmeryAngie and her daughter-in-law Louise who helped with the declutterAngie and her husband live in a large four bedroom house. Now contemplating downsizing, they wanted to tackle the clutter of things accumulated over decades with their two children, Katie and Simon.  Their children weren't keen to help but daughter-in-law Louise offered to step in.\"She was up for the challenge and it made it less stressful,\" says Angie. \"Decluttering brings back memories and it's hard but she made it fun.\"Louise says she was happy to help lighten the load. \"I love Angie and I wanted to help because I know the experience can be overwhelming and difficult.\"Another tip Angie shares is her technique of splitting clutter into small boxes which she tackled one at a time \"in a relaxed way\".\"I look at everything, is it rubbish? Has it got another life? Can I sell it? Should it go to the hospice?\" she says.Angie says she has got rid of hundreds of items by either selling on Vinted or donating. \"It can be such a lovely process to revisit things that you've had from your past and to be able to see it one last time before it goes.\" she says.I kept two boxes of sentimental itemsSarah ThompsonSarah and her husband Steve in their former home of the ShetlandsAuction enthusiast Sarah had bid her way to a big collection of ornaments and trinkets which filled her three-bedroom house in Shetland.She had two months to declutter before moving to a smaller house in Manchester and Sarah says putting a limit on items from each room helped.\"I made this deal with myself - you can have two boxes of sentimental items, things that you really don't want to get rid of and things that really mean something.\"She says she felt \"torn\" because she loved everything she had bought over the years but ended up making well over £100 selling her clutter. \"A lot of items were old or interesting and came with a story - I loved the enthusiasm of those buying what I sold,\" she says.\"We had various old vintage items, including an antique grain bin which was part of Shetland history, which we ending up selling to a pub on the island.\"Sarah was also able to donate to charity shops and says it felt great to move to Manchester for a fresh start without clutter. I took photos of everythingGetty ImagesSusan found taking pictures of things was the best way to keep the memory while losing the item.She did this with her ornaments, which she has donated to charity shops, and is planning to do the same thing with her physical photographs.Susan also has an abundance of cards dating all the way back to the year she got married in 1979.\"We kept all our special cards, so once a week, for an hour or two, I will scan cards in for a particular year and then [they will] always be there if I need them.\"She also reuses the old cards to make new ones and has let go of old cassettes and CDs.\"You can listen to stuff on YouTube,\" she says. \"We've only kept stuff that we can't get anymore.\"I decluttered one thing a dayJenni began her decluttering a few years ago by committing to throw away one thing every day.\"Some days I did more than one thing, some went to charity shops, some went in the bin, some went to the tip,\" she says.By practising this habit every day, she says she was able to train her brain to let go of things more easily, making decluttering a lot easier now than before she started.\"It wasn't overwhelming. If I'd said, 'I'm going to declutter the spare room', I think I would have had to go to bed for a week with shock, but because I thought, I will take one thing out of the spare room and get rid of it it was a method.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "Just nowPaul KirbyEurope digital editor in OsloNTB/Ane Hem/via REUTERSMarius Borg Høiby is giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed she had been druggedThe son of Norway's crown princess has begun giving evidence at his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences.Marius Borg Høiby, 29, looked overwhelmed by the occasion, his voice quivering as he paused several times to take off his glasses and wipe his eyes. Choking back tears, he said it was very difficult to talk, and complained of being followed by the press since he was three years old.He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him. He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed she had been drugged during an \"after-party\" in the basement of his parents' house in December 2018.The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke of her sense of \"betrayal and shock\" after she was shown videos by police allegedly of him sexually assaulting her shortly after they had had brief, consensual sex.She had already spoken of a \"black hole\" in her memory. She had told the court behind closed doors she had no recollection of what happened.The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure.During his first appearance in court on Tuesday, he was seen shaking, and he is understood have had hospital treatment overnight, rather than returning to custody.Appearing in court on Wednesday, he took a seat and after several minutes in which he looked overcome by the occasion, he regained his composure and told the court he had had a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol because he had an extreme need of validation.\"I am known for being my mother's son. Nothing else. I have had an extreme need for validation,\" he told the three judges.His trial coincides with a tense moment for his mother, after she was found to have exchanged hundreds of messages with the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein over a three-year period.The royal palace said on Wednesday that Crown Princess Mette-Marit had postponed a private trip \"until further notice\", without giving further details.However, the storm of criticism over the unguarded, warm tone of the exchanges has heaped pressure on the royal house, when Mette-Marit is also seeing her son on trial for rape. She has expressed regret and poor judgement over the correspondence.The defendant, wearing a dark turtle-neck woollen sweater with a zip, looked straight at the three judges who were sitting about 10m (30ft) away at the front of the court.Although he had notes, he did not look down at them, speaking for about half an hour without interruption.He sat, not looking to his left where two of the women he is alleged to have raped listened to his evidence a short distance away. He spoke of how he met the first woman he is alleged to have raped, talking about how they had met at a party, and he had taken cocaine for the first time.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoMitchell LabiakBusiness reporterGetty ImagesShares in the Danish company which makes Ozempic and Wegovy plunged 18%, as its boss warned things would get worse before they improve following steep price cuts.Novo Nordisk had reported it expected profits and sales to fall by as much as 13%, and on Wednesday chief executive Maziar Mike Doustdar called pricing pressures \"unprecedented\" and \"painful\".Doustdar, who was appointed chief executive last summer, said he hoped the price reduction in Wegovy would be \"an investment for our future\" and open up access to the drug to more people.People should expect the company's share price \"goes down before it comes back up,\" he told CNBC's \"Early Edition Europe\".Weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro have soared in popularity over the last few years, and competition between the firms has helped to drive down prices.In the US, Trump has pushed to make weight-loss medication cheaper after he complained that the \"fat drugs\" were more expensive there than in other countries.In November, he announced the \"most favoured nation\" agreement with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. He said at the time that users of government-run website TrumpRx would be able to get Wegovy and Zepbound from $350 (£255) per month on average and that this would to drop to $250 a month. He added that Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.Many GLP-1 drugs, which is technical name for the drugs used to treat diabetes and obesity, cost over $1,000 a month in the US without insurance or discounts.Novo Nordisk said on Tuesday that \"lower realised prices linked to investments in market access, amplified by the [most favoured nation] agreement with the US Administration to bring GLP-1s to more Americans at a lower cost is assumed\" in its lower and sales profit guidance.It added that \"intensifying competition and negative impacts from the compound patent expiry [...] in certain markets\" had also hit its sales and profit guidance.

    "body": "7 hours agoKoh EweScreenshot/TaobaoTom Felton (pictured) is best known for his role in the Harry Potter seriesAn unlikely Lunar New Year mascot has popped up in China this year - Draco Malfoy. Tom Felton is best known for his role in the Harry Potter series, but now, the actor is also making an appearance in some Chinese houses, with e-commerce sites selling festive decor prominently featuring his face.His sudden popularity is thanks to his Chinese translation of his name Malfoy, Ma-er-fu. It contains the words for horse and fortune, ringing especially auspicious for the upcoming Year of the Horse.Harry Potter is hugely popular in China, with hundreds of millions of books sold. A re-release of the series' first film in 2020 grossed more than 90 million yuan ($13.6m; £9.4m) in three days. Ahead of Lunar New Year this month, Chinese households typically decorate their doors with couplets - a set of auspicious writings heralding health and prosperity in the new year. Others decorate their houses with fuzi - red square papers printed with the Chinese word for prosperity.The fuzi are commonly hung upside down to symbolise luck arriving in the household, as the Chinese word for upside down has the same pronunciation as the word for arrival.On Chinese social media, pictures show some users sticking couplets or upside down pictures of Malfoy's signature smirk.Merchants on e-commerce site Taobao are also seizing on the trend, coming up with  stickers and magnets featuring the Harry Potter character.Others began sharing photos of the character, saying: \"Share this image for good fortune\".\"[It's an] oriental new year with magical elements,\" one user on social media site Weibo commented. \"Felix Felicis!\" said one comment, a reference to a potion in the series that makes the drinker lucky for a period of time. Screenshot / TaobaoE-commerce merchants in China are selling Draco Malfoy-themed new year decorThe Malfoy themed Lunar New Year decor has even caught the eye of actor Felton, who reshared an Instagram story about his character becoming a \"symbol of Chinese New Year in China\".His acknowledgement sparked even more excitement on Chinese social media, with many fans praising him with the hashtag \"Malfoy himself is 100% hilarious\".The wizard franchise enjoys a fervent and huge fanbase in China - and Warner Bros Discovery has announced plans to open the largest Making Of Harry Potter studio tour in Shanghai in 2027.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporter Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer has agreed to release files on his decision to pick Lord Mandelson as his US ambassador, after police launched a probe into claims the ex-minister passed sensitive government information to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.The Tories are pushing a Commons vote later to force the release of documents about how the peer was recruited into the role.Downing Street has agreed to release documents, whilst exempting material that could damage national security or UK diplomatic relations.Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.The peer faces an investigation into alleged misconduct in public office, after claims he sent market-sensitive government information to Epstein whilst a cabinet minister in Gordon Brown's New Labour government.Emails released by the US Department of Justice on Friday suggest Mandelson forwarded Epstein an internal Downing Street memo in 2009 discussing possible government asset sales.Other emails published in the tranche of documents appear to show he gave Epstein advance notice of a €500bn bailout by the EU to save the Euro in 2010.Other emails suggest Epstein made $75,000 in payments to Lord Mandelson in three separate $25,000 transactions in 2003 and 2004. Lord Mandelson has said he has no record or recollection of the payments.The peer, who gave up his Labour Party membership over the weekend, is set to stand down from the House of Lords on Wednesday. The government is drafting legislation required to formally remove his title.The former minister was sacked from the job in September after seven months, after a separate release of emails showed he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail in 2008 for sex offences.'Maximum transparency'A parliamentary motion drawn up by the Conservatives would force the government to release documents relating to his appointment, and the \"due diligence\" conducted by No 10 beforehand.But in a bid to maximise embarrassment for Labour, it would also force the release of a much wider range of material, including any emails and text messages sent by Lord Mandelson to ministers in the six months before getting the role.It would also force the disclosure of messages between the peer and Morgan McSweeney, Sir Keir's chief of staff, whom the Conservatives say has \"serious questions to answer\" over Lord Mandelson's appointment.Labour MPs will be instructed to vote for a government amendment that would agree to the release, but allow for information \"prejudicial to UK national security or international relations\" to be withheld.It is not yet clear how this condition will be interpreted, or how how long it could be before any documents are released. Speaking to the BBC earlier, Health Secretary Wes Streeting argued Sir Keir was \"going for maximum transparency\" in a bid to \"reassure the public\".Defending the decision to appoint him, he added the prime minister \"had not been given the whole truth\" about the extent of Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019 awaiting trail on sex trafficking charges. Lord Mandelson has apologised for continuing the friendship with Epstein after the financier's conviction in 2008, adding he believed \"lies he told me and so many others\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesSir Brian Leveson pictured in his former role as Lord Justice Leveson in 2015The court system is \"on the brink of collapse\" as the backlogs for trials reach unprecedented levels, the head of a major review has said.Sir Brian Leveson, a retired senior judge, warned ministers, the police and others that there could not be a \"pick and mix\" response to solving the crisis.Last year, in the first stage of the review, Sir Brian called for the right to a jury trial to be scaled back and many intermediate crimes to be dealt with by a judge alone.His second and final report has recommended 130 efficiency changes, from technical measures to allowing prison vans to use bus lanes to hit court appearance deadlines.Sir Brian's two reports were commissioned by ministers as part of an attempt to reverse the backlogs that had reached record levels before Labour came into power, but have continued to worsen since then.Last September, the backlog of trials waiting to come to Crown Court in England and Wales was 79,619 cases, double the level seen before the pandemic.It is on track to hit 100,000 cases by November next year and some suspects being charged with offences today are already being told their cases won't be dealt with until 2030.That in turn has led to victims saying they are losing confidence in the system and walking away from the court process.The crisis has deep roots in cuts to spending on courts, judges and barristers. The impact of those decisions in the 2010s has been exacerbated by the pandemic, lawyers quitting criminal work over poor pay while the recruitment of extra police has led to more suspects being sent to court.Sir Brian said that his reports must not lead to a \"pick and mix job\"  but all agencies must act quickly.\"I have never seen pressure on the courts at such an unacceptable level - the system stands on the brink of collapse,\" he said.\"It is failing victims. It is failing witnesses, and on top of that, it's not even good for defendants who wish to challenge the allegations made against them, but whose lives are equally on hold waiting for the court date to appear.\"The one thing we do not have is the luxury of great time.\"Sir Brian's recommendations include appointing a dedicated criminal justice adviser working directly to the prime minister in the heart of government to oversee efficiency reforms to the courts, prisons, prosecutors and police.His 130 other recommendations include:Increasing the use of video remote hearings in courtsAllowing prison vans to use bus lanes to get defendants to courts on time - delays in delivering suspects from prisons is a huge daily problemCut the work police need to do to prepare a file for prosecutors at the start of a caseMore use of artificial intelligence tools to prepare cases and schedule themMaking better use of empty courtrooms - another daily problemSir Brian said ministers, the police, prosecutors and others could pick out some of his recommendations to act on immediately but stressed the entire system needed fixing.The Criminal Bar Association, representing barristers who work in crown and magistrates courts, reiterated its opposition to cuts to jury trials, saying there is no evidence that the proposed major constitutional reform would solve the crisis.Its leaders said local solutions in regional crown courts had shown that backlogs could be reduced and the government needed to learn lessons and fund more such programmes.\"[Sir Brian] has produced a full a MOT test report on the criminal justice system,\" said Riel Karmy-Jones KC and Andrew Thomas KC.\"His report is an 800 page list of failures and requirements for immediate action. Just like maintaining a car, you can't just fix one component and ignore the rest.\"If the MoJ and the Treasury do not act on this, the criminal justice system is going to end up on the scrapheap.\"Responding to the report, Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor David Lammy said the government would respond to the recommendations in the coming weeks.\"Efficiencies alone are not a silver bullet, but making the system more efficient and saving time across the board is a vital part of a wider package to tackle the problem of victims suffering for years for their cases to be heard,\" he said.\"We inherited a creaking justice system struggling with the burden of modern crime and using digital technology in order to make courts more efficient will be a central pillar of our approach to modernisation.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBrian Wheeler,political reporterandAlex Partridge,political reporter Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson surprised everyone in 2008 when he arrived in Downing StreetPeter Mandelson's skills as a political operator were so highly prized by successive Labour prime ministers that they were apparently prepared to overlook past scandals to hand him a series of senior roles.Yet the release of emails by the US Department of Justice appear to show Mandelson himself was receiving advice on political strategy from US financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.Crucially, Lord Mandelson appears to have kept Epstein informed of developments in the immediate aftermath of the 2010 general election, as Gordon Brown made a doomed attempt to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats.On 9 May, Lord Mandelson appears to tell Epstein: \"GB now having 'secret' talks with [Lib Dem leader Nick] Clegg in Foreign Office\".And then, at 09.07am on Monday 10 May, he appears to tell Epstein: \"Finally got him to go today\".Brown's resignation as Labour leader, it was later claimed, was the price demanded by Clegg to begin coalition talks with Labour.In the end, these talks went nowhere and Clegg formed a coalition government with David Cameron's Conservatives.Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment about these email exchanges, which appear to give an almost minute-by-minute account of the five days of coalition wrangling, which gripped the nation after there was no clear general election winner.On 8 May, two days after the election, while talks were taking place between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, an email appears to show Lord Mandelson telling Epstein he'd spent \"all day first with [Gordon Brown] then with Libs. They are all pretty bonkers…\"Epstein suggests \"stressing\" in negotiations that the Liberal Democrat plus Labour vote is \"15m v 10 million votes\".Later the same day, the financier suggests \"why not let tories govern with minority, no coalition\" suggesting they won't be able to get \"anything done\". It seems that Lord Mandelson, whose name and email address are redacted for most but not all of the messages, replies \"cos GB thinks British economy will collapse without [him] at helm\".Epstein also passed on advice from someone referred to as \"jess\" that \"supporting gb will be seen as bad form commercially, he has lost the confidence of the public\".He added that \"jpm\" [investment bank JP Morgan] is \"very concerned that the pound could be the next currency to falter. and big time. uncertainty is not in your favor\".At the time Greece was seeking a bailout from the EU amid its debt crisis.Lord Mandelson appears to reply \"agree but method and timing is all\" saying he's \"getting messages both from people saying to take GB out and keep him there to do deal with Libs. Ideally [should] do both. But cannot see how\".On 11 May, with negotiations still ongoing, Epstein tells Lord Mandelson \"a mere opposition party, is not in your interest\" to which Lord Mandelson seems to reply \"Not sure in my interest to father a mutual suicide pact\".Epstein then suggests making \"a real offer you can live with…if clegg won't agree, it would be on his shoulders\" and if he does \"youve bought time\".Hours later Epstein receives an email saying \"It's over. I am out of govt at the end of the day…\"Later the same day, as Lord Mandelson appears to say he is attending a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, Epstein offers a \"big hug\".The email exchanges are peppered with gossipy and sometimes indiscreet comments.On 6 May 2010, as UK voters went to the polls, Epstein asks his friend how it was going, to which Mandelson apparently replies \"we are praying for a hung parliament. Alternatively, a well hung young man\".'Third time lucky'Brown's decision to bring Lord Mandelson back into government, in October 2008, stunned Westminster.The pair had once been inseparable as they worked with Tony Blair to create New Labour.But Brown had never forgiven Lord Mandelson for what he saw as his betrayal in backing Blair for the party leadership in 1994.Explaining his decision to bring his bitter rival back into the fold as business secretary and a member of the House of Lords, Brown said: \"Serious people are needed for serious times.\"The appointment was seen as a daring gamble by Brown, whose government was floundering in the face of the biggest economic crisis in a generation.Lord Mandelson was a divisive figure who had twice been forced to resign from Tony Blair's government.Brown hoped that his old foe's political nous and experience as an EU trade commissioner would add much-needed heft to his government's handling of the global economic crisis.\"We are bringing together the best team possible to deal with the difficulties [that we face],\" Brown told reporters. Lord Mandelson acknowledged that the pair had had their \"ups and downs\" but said they were now \"joined at the hip\".As he bowled up Downing Street to start his new job, he joked to astonished reporters that it was \"third time lucky\".PA MediaGordon Brown turned to his old rival in his hour of needIn June 2009, Lord Mandelson's status was enhanced further when Brown gave him the honorary title first secretary of state, making him the de-facto deputy prime minister.In that same month, the DoJ emails suggest Lord Mandelson forwarded an internal memo on selling off government-held assets in order to raise public funds to Epstein.The Cabinet Office has referred material to the police after an initial review \"found that they contain likely market sensitive information surrounding the 2008 financial crash and official activities thereafter to stabilise the economy\".Part of Lord Mandelson's mystique - and one of the reasons he is despised by some in the Labour movement - is his love of political intrigue, gossip and plots.And this appears to be on full display in his alleged exchanges with Epstein.In early 2010, he appears to be discussing removing Brown as Labour leader or running for leader himself.On 6 February, he tells Epstein: \"If I continue as now people will say I am one of the few (only) big figures. And I have to deliver a reasonable campaign that only he [expletive]'s up. And that I perform well in the campaign itself. That I was bigger than the lot of them.\"Epstein allegedly replies: \"lets not dwell on him, i am only interested in how this plays out for you.\"Lord Mandelson allegedly says: \"Perhaps but either way - direct or not - he cannot take the truth. He needs 5 years of therapy...\"In another email on 31 March, he appears to tell Epstein that Brown \"needs to be confined asap to a sanitorium\".",

    "body": "51 minutes agoPaul GlynnCulture reporterReutersFoy won two Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for her portrayal of the late Queen in The CrownThe Crown star Claire Foy has said she had parasites for five years after catching an infection, and no longer drinks caffeine as a result.The award-winning British actress, known for playing Queen Elizabeth II in the hit Netflix royal drama, said she thinks she contracted the bug in Morocco.Speaking on the Table Manners podcast with Jessie and Lennie Ware, Foy explained: \"Quite a few years ago, I had parasites. Gross.\"I kept losing weight and I didn't know what was going on. They travel as a pair. I got told by the doctor, gross, absolutely rank. It's disgusting.\"The 41-year-old went on to explain that she had to make changes to her diet - including ditching caffeine - because she \"didn't want to take really hardcore antibiotics\".\"I took all this little gross stuff, and part of that was giving up caffeine,\" said the star, who is also known for BBC historical drama Wolf Hall and A Very British Scandal.Asked how long she thought she had parasites for, Foy replied: \"At least five years.\"Revealing more about her gut health and dietary needs, Foy said she dramatically cut down on eating gluten or sugar in order to help manage a separate autoimmune condition.\"This is my big secret, I feel like I'm in The Traitors or something, and I'm letting everyone know that I'm related to someone,\" she joked.\"I don't actually eat gluten or sugar... except when I go out for dinner. It doesn't have an impact on me. It's just because I have an autoimmune condition, so I should avoid anything which causes more inflammation.\"Foy won two Emmy awards and a Golden Globe for her portrayal of the late Queen, and also starred in the 2022 film Women Talking and the new screen adaptation of H Is For Hawk.The actress is set to appear in two more forthcoming films: Enid Blyton fantasy The Magic Faraway Tree, and the black comedy Savage House, opposite Richard E Grant.Last month, she told the Sunday Times that when she was younger, she thought she would \"never make it past 40\" due to \"many medical things in my life\".What is a parasite?Most worm infections are not serious though and can be easily treated with medicine.The NHS suggests contacting your GP if they find a large worm, a piece of worm or worm eggs in their poo, have a red, itchy worm-shaped rash on your skin; or sickness, diarrhoea or a stomach ache for longer than two weeks.Another potential symptom, as in Foy's case, is losing weight for no discernible reason.These infections are usually caught while travelling, and they can take a long time to show symptoms.They can be contracted by touching objects or surfaces with worm eggs on them, and by eating or drinking something with baby worms in it - such as under-cooked beef, pork or freshwater fish.Parasites can, in part, be avoided by thoroughly washing your hands, as well as any fruit and vegetables, before cooking and eating.Other tips include drinking bottled or boiled water in high-risk areas, and deworming pets regularly.",

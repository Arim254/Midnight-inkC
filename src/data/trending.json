American company CB&I has announced it has entered into a deal to buy the firm's asset solutions business in the first quarter of 2026.Petrofac employs 3,000 people in the UK, including about 2,000 in Aberdeen.The company went into administration in October after the collapse of a renewables contract in the Netherlands and a wider slump in its fortunes. Petrofac group chief executive Tareq Kawash said: \"This is a great outcome for the asset solutions business, supporting job security for 3,000 talented team members.\"James Bennett, joint administrator for Petrofac, said the deal was \"a very positive outcome\".Mark Butts, president and chief executive of Texas-based CB&I, also welcomed the deal, stating that both firms \"share similar management philosophies and industry-leading safety performance\". Founded in Texas in 1981, Petrofac designs and builds facilities for oil, gas and renewables projects, as well as providing engineering, project management and logistical services.It has been involved in the operation of North Sea oil platforms for firms including BP and Shell.Once a FTSE 100 firm, the company was worth around £6bn at its peak in 2012 but it has slumped in recent years following a Serious Fraud Office investigation and a series of profit warnings.It also has offices in London, Woking and Great Yarmouth.

    "body": "The jailed ex-president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has undergone a successful surgery for a double hernia, his wife Michelle says. The former leader is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 presidential election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Brazil's Supreme Court granted permission for the 70-year-old to be transferred from the room in the federal police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to a hospital in the capital, Brasília, for the procedure. Ahead of the surgery, Jair Bolsonaro endorsed the candidacy of his eldest son, Flávio, for the 2026 presidential race. The former president made his decision known in handwritten letter that was read out by Flávio Bolsonaro outside the hospital were his father is being treated.\"During my life, I have fought tough battles, paying a high price with both my health and my family, to defend what I think is best for our country,\" Bolsonaro wrote.\"I hand over what is most important in the life of a father - my own son for the mission of rescuing our country, Brazil.\"Flávio Bolsonaro, a 44-year-old senator, had already announced his decision to run for president for his father's Liberal Party.Ealier this month, he said his father had entrusted him \"with the mission of continuing our national project\". But Jair Bolsonaro's letter, which has been published by Brazilian media, is confirmation the senator has his father's backing.The incumbent, President Lula, has already announced he plans to run again in the presidential election scheduled for October 2026. In 2022, the presidential election went into a run-off, which saw the older Bolsonaro take on ex-President Lula. When Lula narrowly won, Jair Bolsonaro refused to accept the result and plotted with top military leaders to prevent Lula from taking up office. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023.Bolsonaro was found guilty of coup-plotting and sentenced in September this year. Despite the guilty verdict, the older Bolsonaro still wields considerable political influence.Brazil's Congress passed a bill last week to significantly shorten Bolsonaro's sentence but President Lula said he would veto it.  Jair Bolsonaro is expected to be transferred back to federal police headquarters as soon as doctors give the go-ahead. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending.

Zelensky said he had asked Witkoff and Kushner to pass along Christmas greetings to US President Donald Trump \"and the entire Trump family\".The Kremlin said it was analysing proposals brought back from the US by a Russian envoy.Trump and his envoys have been holding talks with both Ukraine and Russia in an effort to reach a deal to end the war which was started by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.There appears to have been some progress in recent days with Ukraine's president praising the \"good ideas\" put forward by Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Kushner.Zelensky said it had been an \"active day\" for his country's diplomacy, as he went into details with the US envoys.He conceded that there was still \"work to be done on sensitive issues\" but added that \"together with the American team, we understand how to put all of this in place\".Zelensky added that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov, the country's top security official, \"will continue discussions with the American team\".The 20-point peace plan agreed by the US and Ukraine is seen as an update to the  initial draft prepared by Witkoff several weeks ago.That draft was widely seen as heavily geared towards Russia's maximalist pre-invasion demands, which Kyiv and its European allies said would mean the de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Describing the updated proposal on Wednesday, Zelensky had said it offered Russia the potential withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the east and the creation of a demilitarised zone in their place.He said the plan now included security guarantees from the US, Nato and Europeans for a co-ordinated military response if Russia invaded Ukraine again.On the key question of Ukraine's industrial eastern Donetsk region, Zelensky said a \"free economic zone\" was a potential option. Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. They are collectively known as Donbas.Zelensky has been under heavy pressure from Trump to cede all of Donbas to Russia during ongoing Washington-led peace negotiations.The Ukrainian leader has so far rejected any territorial concessions, and instead demanded iron-clad security guarantees for Ukraine in any potential settlement.Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must leave Donbas or Russia will seize it.On Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was studying the proposals brought back from the US by the Russian envoy, Kirill Dmitriev.\"We are examining this material, and depending on the decisions made by the head of state, we will continue our communication with the Americans,\" he said.While diplomatic efforts to end the conflict inch forward, fighting continues on the ground. The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck one of Russia's key oil refineries in the southern region of Rostov with cruise missiles. The Novoshakhtinsk refinery near the Ukrainian border is critical for supplying fuel for Russian military operations in occupied eastern Ukraine.The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the settlement of Sviato-Pokrovske in the Donetsk region.Earlier this week, Ukrainian troops withdrew from the embattled eastern town of Siversk.The capture of the town brings Russia closer to the last remaining \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk still in Ukrainian hands in the Donetsk region.",

    "body": "10 hours agoMadeline HalpertWatch: Powerful storm batters southern CaliforniaHeavy rain storms across large parts of California triggered floods and mudslides and left three dead as of Christmas night, local officials said. The storms - which were expected to continue through Friday - brought 11 inches (27 cms) of rainfall to some parts of Los Angeles County, prompted evacuations and shut down major roads. Emergency responders have had to perform several rescues, including people stuck in vehicles as flood waters rise. California's Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday in Los Angeles and other southern Californian counties. About 100,000 people in the state were without power as of Thursday evening. The US Weather Prediction Center said on Thursday that \"numerous flash flooding events are possible\". \"In addition, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.\" A 64-year-old man from San Diego was killed on Wednesday morning by a fallen tree, the police department told US media. Another person, a 74-year-old, died from flood waters over the weekend as police tried to rescue him from inside a vehicle in Redding, the town's mayor told local news.Heavy rain threatens US west coastAnd on Monday, a woman in her 70s died after she \"was knocked off a rock by a large wave and swept into the ocean\" at MacKerricher State Park in Mendocino County, the sheriff's office said.Evacuation warnings were in effect for some residents of San Bernardino County in southern California, and flash food warnings were issued for those in the San Francisco Bay area on Thursday morning. Wind speeds in the Bay Area topped 100mph (161km/h) at one observatory near San Jose, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.ReutersIn Altadena, near Los Angeles, flooding caused a mudlide in a vegetation-stripped area that was less able to absorb water due to the wildfires that scorched the neighbourhood in January, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has also declared an emergency from the storms and warned residents to be cautious on roads during a time of busy holiday travel. \"I am urging all Angelenos to stay safe and be extremely careful on the roads if you absolutely must travel,\" she said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Please do not take this storm lightly.\"The storms came from multiple atmospheric rivers that carried large plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, CBS News reported.",

    "body": "4 hours agoThe Royal Family dominates the Boxing Day front pages, with pictures of them attending the Christmas Day church service at the Sandringham Estate along with reports of King Charles III's Christmas message. Catherine, Princess of Wales, is pictured waving to crowds on the front page of the Times, while the main story focuses on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' \"mansion tax\" which, it says, tens of thousands of homeowners will have to pay because of inaccurate assessments. According to the paper, properties could be overvalued by as much as £30,000, leading to homeowners being dragged over the £2m threshold. The Guardian leads with its own research, which suggests that fewer than one in 60 public sector workers are sharing leave with their partners when they have a baby. Experts have criticised it as a \"lost decade\" of progress on parental rights. The King and Queen Camilla are pictured on the front as they attend church in Sandringham.A teacher at a school in Oxfordshire says he was referred to the government's counter-terrorism programme after showing videos of US President Donald Trump to his politics class, the Daily Telegraph reports. The teacher says he began a grievance procedure against Henley College and received a £2,000 payoff in a negotiated settlement after he was effectively forced to resign, according to the paper. The school was quoted as saying: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\" Meanwhile, the paper chose to feature Princess Charlotte on its front page as she joined her family for the church service.  The King's Christmas message leads the Daily Mirror,  saying that he spoke of the \"common values that unite us\". The paper notes that his words come as tensions rise both at home and abroad. High Street shops will net £1bn less than last year on Boxing Day, reports the Daily Mail, citing figures from Barclays Bank. The paper says stretched household budgets will lead people to shun the sales on Friday \"as consumer confidence collapses amid Rachel Reeves' tax bombshells\". The Sandringham service is also featured on the front page, with the paper noting that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie joined the Royal Family in Norfolk while their father stayed in Windsor. The former prince was stripped of his titles after intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.     The appearance of Beatrice and Eugenie leads the Sun, which says the former's \"last-minute\" decision to join her sister with the rest of the Royal Family in Norfolk \"delighted well-wishers\". The paper says their \"show of support\" for the King comes almost a week after the US Department of Justice started releasing hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Epstein case, with Andrew appearing in some of the files. Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. A poll for the Independent suggests that more than a third of Labour supporters say the party would have a better chance of winning the next general election if Sir Keir Starmer were replaced. The paper says 19% of Labour supporters backed Andy Burnham, when asked who should replace the prime minister. The i Paper is leading with analysis of this year's polls by Sir John Curtice, who says Britain is entering \"uncharted territory\" as Labour faces a threat from Nigel Farage's Reform UK and the Green Party under Zack Polanski. The leading polling expert tells the paper that the vote of the two main parties is at a \"record low\", meaning the UK's political landscape has never before \"looked so fragmented\". The Daily Express is celebrating its Christmas appeal on its front page, saying its readers raised more than £100,000 for the children's wheelchair charity Whizz Kidz. The money raised will help buy 20 personalised wheelchairs or other life-changing aids that will give children more freedom, according to the paper. Also featured on the front page is the Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte as they attended the Christmas Day church service.  And finally, the Daily Star decided to feature football royalty on its front page, leading with David Beckham's \"family fracas\". It says that Brooklyn Beckham stayed away while David, Victoria and the rest of the family celebrated Christmas by singing a Spice Girls hit. \"One's in the sun\" is how the Guardian captions a photograph of King Charles III and Queen Camilla arriving for the Christmas Day church service at Sandringham.The Times says Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's daughters \"walked tall in a united front\" at Sandringham. The paper describes their presence as a public show of support by the Royal Family, as their parents have been \"frozen out\" over their friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.For the Sun, it was the sisters showing support for the King and Queen. The Daily Mail's take is that Andrew's girls opted for \"the Firm over Mum and Dad\".The Times warns that thousands more homes than expected could become eligible to pay the \"mansion tax\" announced in November's budget, because of the way property values will be calculated. It says a computer-based system - which will be quicker to implement - could over-value properties by as much as £30,000.The Daily Mail says Barclays is predicting a £1bn Boxing Day sales slump compared with last year. The paper says analysts believe fewer people will be going out to the sales because the chancellor's recent tax announcements \"stretched household budgets\" and caused \"a collapse in consumer confidence\".The Daily Mirror warns that bargains are no answer to low wages, soaring bills and an economy stacked against ordinary, hardworking people.The Daily Telegraph says a teacher who showed videos - including one about Donald Trump's inauguration - to his US politics A-level class was reported to Oxfordshire's child safeguarding authority. The body concluded that he should be referred to the government's counter-terrorism programme, Prevent. The paper says Henley College gave him a £2,000 pay-off to quit. In an official email, the college told the teacher that some of the videos had not been related to the syllabus - and one had made a student feel \"quite uncomfortable\". The school was quoted as saying: \"The Henley College does not comment on individual allegations or ongoing investigations.\"The Sun says some gangs are raking in £50,000 a time by sending drones into jails packed with contraband, such as phones or drugs. The Times warns that, according to the head of the Prison Governors Association, \"any day now\" a new generation of larger drones that can lift an average man could be used to help inmates escape.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJaroslav LukivUS Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselPresident Donald Trump has said the US launched a \"powerful and deadly strike\" against the Islamic State (IS) group in north-western Nigeria. The US leader described IS as \" terrorist scum\", accusing the group of \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Trump said the US military \"executed numerous perfect strikes\", while the US Africa Command (Africom) later reported that Thursday's attack was carried out in co-ordination with Nigeria in the Sokoto state.Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" targeting \"terrorists\", and it \"has nothing to do with a particular religion\".Without naming IS specifically, Tuggar said the operation had been planned \"for quite some time\" and had used intelligence information provided by the Nigerian side.The minister did not rule out further strikes, adding that this depended on \"decisions to be taken by the leadership of the two countries\". In his post on Truth Social late on Thursday, Trump said that \"under my leadership, our Country will not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".In November, Trump ordered the US military to prepare for action in Nigeria to tackle Islamist militant groups.He did not say at the time which killings he was referring to, but claims of a genocide against Nigeria's Christians have been circulating in recent months in some right-wing US circles.Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". \"Merry Christmas!\" he added, writing on X.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Trump last month ordered the US military to prepare for action in NigeriaThe US Department of Defense later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a military vessel.On Friday morning, the Nigerian foreign ministry said in a statement that the country's authorities \"remain engaged in structured security co-operation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorist and violent extremism. \"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West,\" the statement said.Groups monitoring violence say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are being killed more than Muslims in Nigeria, which is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.An adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told the BBC at the time that any military action against the jihadist groups should be carried out together.Daniel Bwala said Nigeria would welcome US help in tackling the Islamist insurgents but noted that it was a \"sovereign\" country.He also said the jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none.President Tinubu has insisted there is religious tolerance in the country and said the security challenges were affecting people \"across faiths and regions\".Trump earlier announced that he had declared Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\" because of the \"existential threat\" posed to its Christian population. He said \"thousands\" had been killed, without providing any evidence.This is a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".Following this announcement, Tinubu said his government was committed to working with the US and the international community to protect people of all faiths.Jihadist groups such as Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people - however most of these have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group which analyses political violence around the world.In central Nigeria, there are also frequent clashes between mostly Muslim herders and farming groups, who are often Christian, over access to water and pasture.Deadly cycles of tit-for-tat attacks have also seen thousands killed - but atrocities have been committed on both sides.Human rights groups say there is no evidence that Christians have been disproportionately targeted.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.",

    "body": "Brothers 10,000 miles apart meet for first time after childhood adoption20 hours agoNick ServiniBBC WalesFamily photoTheir reunion was described as natural and joyfulIt was a 10,000-mile, 23-hour journey for a meeting that was more than 60 years in the making, but Russell Gower has finally met his older sibling for the first time in-person.Earlier this month, Russell, 64, travelled from his home in south Wales to Brisbane, Australia, to meet with his 69-year-old brother Peter.But, far from being awkward, he described the moment as feeling totally \"natural\", adding that \"there was nothing else other than joy\".The long lost pair's reunion will now be officially marked by a big family party in Brisbane on Christmas Day.  Both men were born in London to parents Ray and Jill.Peter was born when Jill was just 15 and the couple had yet to be married - a situation with a stigma attached in the 1950s which meant he was put up for adoption and taken to Australia where he was raised.Ray and Jill, who have both died, went on to get married after their first son had been adopted, they had Russell a few years later and then a sister Jackie, who has also died.Peter lived most of his life in Australia without realising the truth about his birth family, until his adoptive sister told him in recent years.His granddaughter in Australia then tracked down Russell, who has lived in Llanharan, Rhondda Cynon Taf, for more than 30 years, and DNA tests have been carried out to confirm the link. Russell was told by his sister when he was a teenager that he had an adopted brother, but his mother never directly opened up about Peter.With just a few days to live with terminal cancer in 2007, she said to him: \"There is something I need to tell you.\"Russell is convinced it was to tell him about his brother but she died before she had the chance.SuppliedRay and Jill Gower were not yet married when Peter was born - but later tied the knot and had two more childrenHe said: \"My mother was obviously deeply traumatised by it, although I would never have known that.\"She told my sister in the end. I do not know how she got through her life having lost a baby in those circumstances.\"She must have wondered every single day about what he was doing. What was his first day in school like? Did he have children? It must have been very very tough for her.\"Russell, a retired retail operations manager with a bakery, is married with a daughter, but travelled to Australia alone for the first meeting.He had tried to track down his brother in Australia a number of years ago but his efforts fizzled out.The moment in which both men, with strikingly similar builds, met with a handshake on the drive of Peter's house in Brisbane was captured on camera by relatives who had helped organise the encounter. The entire wider family of 17 people will now gather for a full celebration on Christmas Day.Family photoPeter, surrounded by his family in Australia, was oblivious to the truth about his birth family until recent yearsRussell said he was wary ahead of the meeting but his brother had said he bore no malice or bitterness about the adoption.He said of his feelings before the encounter: \"We really had nothing in common other than blood.\"He has had a completely different life on the other side of the world and a completely different upbringing.\"I was a bit worried about how that was going to be but my concerns were soon set aside. It felt natural from the get-go.\"When I shook his hand and he put his arm on my shoulder, I just knew. There was something about it. It was like we were wired the same.\"Russell says he was worried about the meeting, but now thinks the three-week visit in Australia won't feel long enoughHe said they both \"got a bit emotional\" when he told Peter it would have been their mother's 85th birthday.\"It was just purely coincidental he and I spent some quality time together on what would have been her 85th birthday. The stars had aligned,\" said Russell.\"I am sure she would have been chuffed to see her two boys out having a beer and a chat. It was gold dust.\"It is destiny really. I could have gone through my whole life and never found him and out of the blue here we are.\"With \"so much ground to cover\", the pair are starting to wonder if the three-week visit is long enough.\"It has changed my world.,\" said Russell.\"It could not have come at a better time. Any day of the week would be fantastic but to be invited out there for Christmas is really special.\"I never thought I'd be saying this but I will be having a barbecue on Christmas Day with my brother. Unbelievable.\"More top stories",

    "body": "17 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentKing Charles: 'We can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong'The King's Christmas message has invoked the wartime spirit, calling on communities to pull together in an increasingly divided world and urging people to get \"to know our neighbours\".His traditional speech, recorded in Westminster Abbey, remembered this year's 80th anniversaries of VE Day and VJ Day and said we should \"never lose sight\" of the values in which \"communities came together in the face of such great challenge\".The King, speaking in the abbey's medieval Lady Chapel, also hailed the \"spontaneous bravery\" of those who helped in emergencies, such as the Bondi Beach attack in Australia.A Ukrainian choir sang a carol, with many of the group's singers in the UK because of the war.The speech included a call for quiet and calm as \"our world seems to spin ever faster\", with King Charles quoting poet TS Eliot's words about finding the \"still point of the turning world\".A royal aide said this was a reference to the social impact of new technologies on communities, and that people might consider a \"digital detox\".For the second year, the message was delivered in a location away from a royal palace, the King using a chapel in the abbey to talk about life's \"pilgrimage\" and the lessons for current times.In front of Christmas trees originally used for the Princess of Wales's carol concert at the Abbey, he spoke of the importance of community cohesion and bridging divides.\"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common,\" said the King, speaking under the chapel's famous vaulted ceiling.\"With the great diversity of our communities we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong.\"He praised the wartime generation's \"courage and sacrifice\" and their togetherness in the face of adversity, with the broadcast showing pictures of this year's commemorations marking 80 years since the end of World War Two in Europe and the Far East.\"These are the values which have shaped our country.\"As we hear of division, both at home and abroad, they are the values of which we must never lose sight,\" said the King.Getty ImagesThe setting for this year's speech was the Lady Chapel in Westminster AbbeyThere was praise too for the heroic actions of those caught up in violent incidents.\"Individuals and communities have displayed spontaneous bravery, instinctively placing themselves in harm's way to defend others,\" said the King.His speech was accompanied by images from Bondi Beach in Australia, where earlier this month bystanders intervened against a gun attack on a Jewish community event.There were also pictures of the King at a synagogue in Manchester, where he met members of the congregation who had tried to stop an attacker.As an example of building bridges between religious leaders, the broadcast showed this year's state visit to the Vatican, with the King speaking of the \"historic moment of spiritual unity\" when he prayed with Pope Leo.The King reflected on the Christmas story, describing Jesus, Mary and Joseph as a \"homeless\" family, and saying their message was about \"peace and reconciliation\" and represented a \"prayer for our times\".PA MediaThe King praised the heroic actions of those caught up in violent incidents this yearIt was a Christmas message that did not dwell on any of the King's personal challenges.There was no reference to his health, after he recently recorded a video message saying there was \"good news\" that his cancer treatment would be reduced next year.There were no references to his brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was stripped of his titles this year, in the speech.The accompanying film focused on the working royals, including Prince William and Catherine.There were pictures of Prince George on his first visit to the Passage homelessness charity, where he went with his father Prince William last week.The King has been a strong supporter of Ukraine since Russia's invasion and there was a symbolic sign of this with the broadcast including the Carol of the Bells, a Ukrainian carol sung by the Songs for Ukraine Chorus.Many members of the choir are in the UK because of the war in Ukraine.Earlier, the King led the Royals in celebrating the high point of the festive season with a service of Christmas carols and prayers at St Mary Magdalene Church on Charles's private Sandringham Estate in Norfolk.After the service at St Mary Magdalene Church in Norfolk, the royals greeted and interacted with excited crowds who had gathered on the crisp Christmas morning.",

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "A 22-year-old man has been charged with murder and attempted murder following a triple stabbing in Uxbridge.Afghan national Safi Dawood, of Midhurst Gardens, Uxbridge, was charged with murdering Wayne Broadhurst, a 49-year-old man who was walking his dog on the street. Police were called to reports that three people had been stabbed on Monday at 17:00 GMT and paramedics treated three victims for stab wounds. A 45-year-old man is being treated in hospital with life-changing injuries, and a 14-year-old boy has been discharged from hospital after the incident. Mr Dawood was not known to Mr Broadhurst, but was known to the other two alleged victims, the Metropolitan Police said.He required hospital treatment after \"suffering a medical episode\" and was later returned to police custody where he remained, the force added.One neighbour said Mr Broadhurst was a binman who was \"just doing the normal dog walk that he does every day\".On Wednesday, Katarina Pohancenikova, managing director of Greener Ealing Ltd, confirmed that Mr Broadhurst, who was killed in the attack, was a bin man at Greener Ealing.\"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Wayne's family, friends, and colleagues during this incredibly difficult time,\" she said.\"This is a devastating loss. Wayne was a well-respected and dedicated member of our team who made a real contribution to the work we do and to the residents we serve.\"We ask for the privacy of Wayne's loved ones to be respected as they come to terms with this appalling news.\"The Home Office confirmed the suspect entered the UK in a lorry in November 2020, was granted asylum and leave to remain in 2022, and does not live in Home Office accommodation.He also faces a charge of possession of an offensive weapon and  will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump called on US military leaders to resume testing US nuclear weapons in order to keep pace with other countries such as Russia and China.\"Because of other countries testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis,\" he wrote on social media just before meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea.The US has more nuclear weapons than any other country, Trump said, with Russia second and China a \"distant third\". It has not conducted nuclear weapons testing since 1992.It comes just days after Trump denounced Russia for testing a nuclear-powered missile, which reportedly has an unlimited range.Trump's post on Wednesday night acknowledges the \"tremendous destructive power\" of nuclear weapons, but said he had \"no choice\" but to update and renovate the US arsenal during his first term in office.He also said that China's nuclear programme \"will be even within 5 years\".Trump's post did not include details of how the tests would occur, but wrote the \"process will begin immediately\". It marks an apparent reversal of a long-standing US policy. The last US nuclear weapons test was in 1992, before former Republican President George HW Bush issued a moratorium as the Cold War ended.Trump's post came just before Xi landed in South Korea for the first face-to-face meeting between the two since 2019. The post appeared as he was aboard a helicopter, Marine One, while en route to meet Xi at Gimhae International Airport.The last time the US tested a nuclear bomb was 23 September 1992. The test took place at an underground facility in the western state of Nevada.The project, code named Divider,  was the 1,054th nuclear weapons test conducted by the US, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which played a central role in helping develop the world's first atomic bomb.The Nevada Test Site, 65 miles (105km) north of Las Vegas, is still operated by the US government.\"If deemed necessary, the site could be authorized again for nuclear weapons testing,\" according to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, which is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution.",

    "body": "27 minutes agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenROBIN UTRECHT/ANP/AFPRob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesRob Jetten's centrist-liberal party D66 are in a neck-and-neck race with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders in the Dutch election, according to latest vote projections.With more than 90% of votes counted, both D66 and Wilders' Freedom Party were  heading for 26 seats, a projection from Dutch news agency ANP said early on Thursday.Initial exit polls had put Jetten in the lead. \"Millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity,\" he told supporters.A downbeat Wilders had earlier conceded the result was not what he wanted, having lost at least 10 seats, but said he had still achieved his second best result ever.Three other parties are not far behind, including the conservative liberals on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits it is unlikely he can form a government himself, and even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.Jetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesGoing into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party had won 37 seats in November 2023, but this time the electorate were clearly put off by the realisation that he could not form another coalition.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.The exit poll spelt bad news for Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "Cruise operator 'failed' woman who was left on island and died, family says2 hours agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsThe daughter of a woman who was left behind by a cruise ship on a remote island and later died has accused the operator of a \"failure of care and common sense\".The body of Suzanne Rees, 80, was found by rescue workers on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef on Sunday. The day before, she had been hiking on the island with her fellow passengers but was not on the ship when it left hours later.Katherine Rees said she was \"shocked and saddened\" that the Coral Adventurer left \"without my mum\", whom she described as healthy, active, a keen gardener and bushwalker.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense,\" she said on Thursday.It's understood that Suzanne Rees, from New South Wales, was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, which had left Cairns earlier this week.Passengers, who pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise, were transported to the exclusive island for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, but broke away from the others as she needed to rest. \"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" Katherine said. \"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Katherine said she hoped a coronial inquiry would \"find out what the company should have done that might have saved Mum's life\".The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) said it was investigating the death and would meet the ship's crew when it is due to dock in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for Amsa said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Saturday by the ship's captain.A search party returned to the island a few hours later but efforts to find Suzanne were called off in the early hours of Sunday before a helicopter returned in the morning and found her body. On Wednesday, the chief executive of Coral Expeditions said the company was \"deeply sorry\" for the death and were offering their support to the Rees family. \"We are working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation. We are unable to comment further while this process is under way,\" Mark Fifield said. The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] onboard just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening. This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off,\" Ms Mallinson added.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorReutersRob Jetten became one of the youngest ministers in Dutch history under former PM Mark RutteRob Jetten's achievement in dragging his socially liberal D66 party from fifth place to the top of Dutch politics in less than two years has been extraordinary. But politically, all the stars were perfectly aligned for the 38-year-old to do so.The result of Wednesday's election is too close to call, with Jetten vying with anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders for the most seats in parliament.No other political leader commanded as much screen time during the campaign as Jetten and his smile and cheerful message resonated with voters, while his rivals sometimes struggled.Hardly a night went by without him on TV. When Wilders cancelled an appearance because of security fears, Rob Jetten seized the moment and took his place. He even featured in a TV quiz show recorded months ago called The Smartest Person.And his D66 party was untarnished by involvement in Wilders' ill-fated 11-month coalition, largely because Jetten had fared so poorly in the last election in 2023. The government collapsed last June when Wilders' party quit following a row over migration.But perhaps more than anything else, he was able to convey a positive message summed up by the slogan Het kan wel - an optimistic phrase that borrows from Barack Obama's \"Yes, we can\".It contrasted strongly with Wilders, who he accused of \"sowing division\".If his party does come top, Rob Jetten could become the Netherlands' first openly gay prime minister.A self-confessed politics nerd as a child, the young Jetten grew up in a small town in the southern province of Brabant and came out when he was young.Jetten has not made his private life part of his political identity, but five years ago he posted a video in which he read out a long list of homophobic messages from his phone, to prove why an international day against homophobia was important.Jetten is now engaged to Argentine hockey player, Nicolás Keenan, and they are due to marry next year.EPAJetten led a highly polished campaign and outperformed rivals in TV debatesHe was an early supporter of the centrist D66, which describes itself as progressive and socially liberal party, and officials soon spotted his potential.After a few years working for Dutch rail network ProRail, Jetten was elected as an MP in 2017 and had a couple of early experiences as leader before he served under long-serving prime minister Mark Rutte as climate minister.But not everything has worked out smoothly in Jetten's career. A parliamentary colleague complained he was \"pushy\" on the climate, and his big ambitions as minister were cut short when Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring.He led D66's disastrous campaign in 2023 when the party came away with only nine seats, two years after his predecessor Sigrid Kaag managed second place after Rutte.Jetten was not yet as fluent in front of the cameras. Some media appearances he gave were criticised as dull, and one critic labelled him \"Robot Jetten\".\"Robot Jetten is going to be prime minister!\" one reporter said to him incredulously as his success became clear on Wednesday night.\"Sometimes it can work out really crazy in politics,\" Jetten replied with a broad grin.EPAJetten fought a close race against anti-Islam populist Geert WildersSupporters see him as a kind of mini-Mark Rutte, who is now head of Nato. And that comparison will suit Jetten fine, as many Dutch now look back warmly on the stability of the Rutte years, after two years of relative turmoil.Both men always appear cheerful and pragmatic, and both are notorious for getting by on precious little sleep. However, party colleague Roy Kramer noticed a difference: \"Rutte is a chatterbox, Jetten is a bit quieter,\" he told Dutch newspaper Het Parool.The liberal leader has big ambitions, and few challenges are more pressing than tackling the Netherlands' housing crisis, with a shortage of some 400,000 homes.Jetten wants to build 10 cities and complains Dutch governments have not really achieved anything impressive for the past 10 to 15 years. He is making big promises and will come under pressure to deliver.For Jetten to succeed he will need some of Rutte's teflon political coating that saw him through four governments.He has already survived one awkward moment in the campaign, when a joke about Crown Princess Amalia fell flat in front of 2,000 students in Rotterdam,\"I think the best way of promoting work in the military is being able to end up training with the Crown Princess. I bet a few guys in this audience would be interested in that,\" he said.The debate moderator hit back saying: \"what kind of sexist remark is that?\"Jetten later admitted it was inappropriate, but it appears to have done him no harm.

    "body": "11 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterNvidia has hit a new milestone, becoming the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5tn (£3.8tn).The US chip giant has rapidly climbed from a niche graphics-chip designer to an AI titan, as euphoria about the potential of artificial intelligence keeps driving demand for its chips and propelling its stock to record highs.The company reached a market value of $1tn for the first time in June 2023 and hit the $4tn valuation mark just three months ago.Shares in the chip-maker rose as much as 5.6% to more than $212 on Wednesday morning, boosted by investor optimism about Nvidia's sales in China, which has been a geopolitical flashpoint.The world's most valuable company - the biggest winner in the AI spending spree - has soared past its rivals in the technology sector. It has struck deals with leading AI companies including OpenAI and Oracle as its chips continue to power the AI boom.Nvidia's value now exceeds the GDP of every country except the US and China, according to data from the World Bank, and is higher than entire sectors of the S&P 500.Microsoft and Apple have also recently crossed the $4tn valuation mark, reinforcing a broader tech rally fuelled by optimism on Wall Street about AI spending.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year.But concerns about an AI bubble - and whether these companies are overvalued - continue to mount as tech stocks hit record after record.Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, called Nvidia's $5tn valuation \"a sum so vast the human brain can't properly get a handle on it\".\"Of course, this is going to do nothing to dispel fears over an AI bubble, but the market seems keen to march on regardless,\" she added.Some sceptics are now publicly asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\". Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. For example, OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, last month secured a $100bn investment from Nvidia.Nvidia's share price dipped in April when global markets were jolted by US President Donald Trump's intensifying trade wars. Concerns about Trump's trade policies linger, but Nvidia's stock has still seen strong growth since the spring.It share price has risen more than 50% so far this year.Investors have been focused on Nvidia's access to China, which is the biggest market for its products and has been investing heavily to produce its own high-end chips. Nvidia had previously been banned from selling its most advanced chips to China, before Trump reversed the ban in July. Nvidia has to pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government in an unprecedented deal struck in the summer.Trump, who is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, said on Wednesday that the two leaders will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence processors. His comments helped nudge Nvidia's stock even higher.Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive who has achieved celebrity status amid the company's meteoric rise, announced a flurry of partnerships on Tuesday. He said he expects $500 billion in AI chip orders through next year.",

    "body": "MPs question value for money of Prince Andrew's Royal Lodge lease6 hours agoJaroslav LukivShutterstockPrince Andrew has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004 and has a 75-year leaseParliament's spending watchdog has raised concerns over whether Prince Andrew's lease arrangements are \"achieving the best value for money\", amid increased scrutiny over the cost of his accommodation at the Windsor mansion.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) asked the Crown Estate and Treasury to explain the rationale behind the lease on the 30-room Royal Lodge by 28 November.Prince Andrew took a 75-year lease on the property in 2003 and paid a large amount up front, including for renovations, in effect, so there would be no rent liability.There has been increased focus on the prince over his links with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The prince has always denied any wrongdoing.When he took on the lease Prince Andrew had to pay £5m for renovations, £2.5m towards rent in advance, an extra £1m premium, and then in practice an extra £2.5m for renovations, according to the National Audit Office and Crown Estate.In Wednesday's letter to the Crown Estate and the Treasury, PAC chair Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown wrote: \"There is considerable and understandable public interest in the spending of public money in relation to Prince Andrew, which in part stems from the fact that he is no longer a working royal and from serious and disturbing allegations made against him.\"In a series of questions, Sir Geoffrey asked whether the cost of any works on the property had been funded by the taxpayer, and what the Crown Estate's plan was to ensure value for money in any future agreements with Prince Andrew.\"We are therefore concerned as to whether the lease arrangements for Royal Lodge are, in light of recent developments and changes in the responsibilities of Prince Andrew, achieving the best value for money,\" the letter said.It added that it was a concern that the terms of the lease, including those related to maintenance, were being enforced to maintain the \"nationally important royal residence\".A Treasury spokesperson said: \"The Crown Estate is an organisation independent of both the government and the monarch.\"We will respond to Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown in due course.\"The Crown Estate has not publicly commented on the PAC letter.Prince Andrew - who gave up titles including the Duke of York earlier this month -   has lived at Royal Lodge since 2004, after signing the 75-year lease deal the previous year with the Crown Estate, an independent property company which is owned by the monarch.The Grade II-listed Royal Lodge boasts a gardener's cottage, a Chapel Lodge, six-bedroom cottage and security accommodation.ReutersPrince Andrew paid significant amounts up front on his lease deal for Royal LodgeLast week, more details emerged about how he could afford his sprawling mansion, after the lease agreement had been revealed.The arrangement means he has only ever paid a token - or peppercorn - annual rent on Royal Lodge, and even that might not be required under his deal with the Crown Estate, a lease document seen by BBC News confirms.In effect, those payments - which totalled more than £8m and were detailed in a National Audit Office report - meant he was buying himself out of future rent obligations for the duration of the lease, based on paying in advance a notional rent of £260,000 per year.Last week, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on the PAC to launch an inquiry and ask Prince Andrew to give evidence about his lease of Royal Lodge.While there is nothing preventing a House of Commons committee from inviting Prince Andrew to do this, an appearance in such a setting by a member of the Royal Family would be unprecedented. It is unclear whether the committee would be able to compel him to do so.The government has so far refused to give MPs time to debate Prince Andrew's titles or taxpayer-funded home.There have been reports that Prince Andrew is willing to leave Royal Lodge but wants other royal properties for himself and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.Buckingham Palace has not commented on whether Prince Andrew might move out of his home - or where he might go.In a separate development, it emerged this week that Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at Royal Lodge as part of his daughter Beatrice's birthday celebrations in 2006 - two months after a US arrest warrant had been issued for Epstein for the sexual assault of a minor. Andrew did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLana LamSydneySuppliedBen Austin, 17, died after being struck by a cricket ball during trainingAn Australian teenager has died after he was hit by a cricket ball during a practice session in Melbourne.Ben Austin, 17, was training in cricket nets in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday when he was struck in the head or neck by a ball. It's believed he was wearing a helmet.Emergency workers were called to the scene shortly before 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) and the boy was rushed to Monash Children's Hospital in critical condition. He was put on life support but died on Thursday.The Ferntree Gully Cricket Club said it was \"absolutely devastated\" by the \"tragic passing\" of one its players and the teenager's death \"will be felt by all in our cricket community\".Ferntree Gully and District Cricket Association president Arnie Walters said Ben was \"both talented and popular in local cricket\".\"I know how heavily this news will land across our community and we will provide any and all support we can to our clubs and cricket family,\" he said.In a social media post, Ben's cricket club extended their condolences to his family and friends and \"to all of those who knew Ben and the joy that he brought\".\"We ask you to please respect the privacy of Ben's family during this time,\" the post said.On behalf of the teenager's family, the club also thanked Ambulance Victoria, the police and hospital staff.Waverley Park Hawks Junior Football Club, for which Ben played more than 100 games, said he was \"kind\", \"respectful\" and a \"fantastic footballer\".\"Our club and community have lost a truly great young person who was developing into a fine young adult and his loss will be felt keenly by our club for many years to come.\"The BBC has contacted Cricket Australia and Cricket Victoria for comment.The incident comes just over a decade after Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014.His death, for which a coroner ultimately found no-one was to blame, sparked improvements to safety equipment for those playing the sport.",

    "body": "13 hours agoPeter Mwai, Merlyn Thomas and Matt MurphyBBC Verify    BBCWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions of executions.Fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have executed a number of unarmed people after capturing the Sudanese city of el-Fasher, new videos analysed by BBC Verify show.The RSF, which has engaged in a brutal war with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for more than two years, seized a key military base in the city over the weekend after an extended siege.Several videos have since emerged showing men wearing military fatigues and some with what appear to be RSF patches carrying out extreme acts of violence around el-Fasher. The UN's Sudan coordinator said it had received \"credible reports of summary executions\" in the city during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday.BBC Verify has approached the RSF for comment. Imran Abdullah, an adviser to the paramilitary, denied the group's fighters were targeting civilians in an interview with the BBC on Monday.Sudan has been ravaged by war since the conflict broke out in 2023, prompted by the collapse of the SAF and the RSF's fragile ruling coalition. More than 150,000 people have died across the country and about 12 million have fled their homes since then.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Denise Brown - the UN's Sudan coordinator - said she had received reports of executions against \"unarmed men in particular\" since the RSF entered el-Fasher. Killings of unarmed civilians or surrendering combatants is a war crime under the Geneva Convention.Most of the clips reviewed by BBC Verify are in dusty and sandy rural locations, making it hard to say where exactly they took place. However, we did geolocate one video showing the summary shooting of an unarmed man at a university building in el-Fasher.The clip showed the unarmed man sitting amid dozens of dead bodies in a hallway. As the video progressed, he was seen turning towards the camera which followed an armed man who was descending the stairs. The fighter then raised his rifle and fired a single shot knocking the unarmed man to the ground, where he lay motionless.A number of similarly distressing clips are circulating online, but are difficult to geolocate as they are recorded outside the city itself where there are very few visible landmarks. But BBC Verify has managed to place one of the fighters who appeared in multiple execution videos in the area around el-Fasher in recent days.The fighter, who goes by the name of Abu Lulu, has long had his activities with the RSF documented on a social media profile viewed by BBC Verify.A video which first appeared online over the weekend showed him amidst dead bodies in an area north-west of the city. Working with the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), BBC Verify has been able to confirm the location of this footage, but it's difficult to say whether the dead in the clip are civilians or SAF troops killed in fighting due to the quality of the video.But Abu Lulu has also appeared in at least two videos which show him participating in the execution of unarmed men who are kneeling and under armed guard. Reverse image searches show all the videos have appeared online since the weekend.In one video he was seen addressing an injured man lying on the ground, berating him for not sharing information before threatening to rape him. The RSF fighter then shot the captive several times using an automatic rifle.A separate video shows Abu Lulu standing alongside several RSF troops carrying AK-style assault rifles and guarding a group of at least nine unarmed captives. After addressing the men, Abu Lulu aimed his rifle at the group and opened fire. In the aftermath the other armed men raised their arms and cheered.In another clip the fighter was seen standing alongside several other armed men with dozens of dead bodies visible in the background. Some of the fighters were wearing RSF style uniforms, one of which has a circular patch with a black line running around the circumference - consistent with the paramilitary's insignia.Fighters involved in shootings were wearing patches consistent with RSF insigniaIn August the RSF said it would investigate Abu Lulu after he was accused of executing a captive. A statement said \"if it is proven that the perpetrator is indeed a member of our ranks, he will be held accountable without delay\".The videos come after US-based researchers said that satellite images taken of el-Fasher since the city fell appear to show the aftermath of mass killings carried out in the streets of the city itself.Analysts with the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab highlighted large \"clusters\" visible in the images, which they said were \"consistent with the size range of adult human bodies and are not present in previous imagery\".In the report issued on Monday, Yale said that its analysts' observations were \"consistent with reports of executions\" shared online and by the UN and human rights groups in recent days and also highlighted \"discoloration\" which the analysts said may be human blood.Without on-the-ground footage from that location, BBC Verify cannot independently confirm Yale's findings.Other satellite images viewed by BBC Verify appeared to show vehicles parked at each end of several streets. Yale analysts noted that their positioning appeared to suggest that the paramilitary was carrying out house-to-house clearance operations. In some areas, clusters that Yale identified as human bodies were seen near the vehicles.Sudan's military expels top UN food aid officials as conflict escalatesUN pleads for safe passage for civilians trapped in war-hit Sudan cityFear of mass killings as thousands trapped in besieged Sudan city taken by militia groupMichael Jones, an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said the RSF has a track record of carrying out ethnically-based summary killings which could be partially attributed to the paramilitary's \"decentralised composition\".\"The bulk of the group's manpower comes from a messy confederation of rented militia, local allies and economic opportunists, who are often motivated by interests or grievances that pre-date the April 2023 conflict,\" he told BBC Verify.\"Although likely playing out under the umbrella of RSF policy, the violence can sometimes be decentralised, with perpetrators settling personal or communal vendettas, seizing assets or land, and participating in ethnic cleansing to consolidate their own political power.\"In recent months the SAF has made several major gains against the RSF, including recapturing the capital Khartoum, so that the army now controls most of the north and the east of the country.By contrast the RSF controls almost all of Darfur in the west and much of the neighbouring Kordofan region - the traditional base of its predecessor, the Janjaweed paramilitary which carried out ethnic killings in Darfur between 2003 and 2005. Many of those who fought with the Janjaweed are believed to have joined the RSF.Until now el-Fasher was the last major urban centre in Darfur still held by government forces and its allies. The RSF has previously said that it hopes to form a rival government in the city when it had assumed control there.Both sides have been accused of war crimes since the conflict began and in the closing days of President Joe Biden's administration the US said the RSF had carried out acts of genocide. BBC Verify has previously documented mass killings carried out by the RSF following the defection of a senior commander.Additional reporting by Kumar Malhotra, Benedict Garman, Richard Irvine-Brown, Daniele Palumbo, Paul Myers and Thomas Copeland.",

    "body": "8 hours agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeThe Rapid Support Forces militia reportedly killed hundreds of civilians at the main hospital in el-Fasher, days after it captured the Sudanese city, the head of the UN's health agency says.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported killing of 460 people at the hospital.Earlier, the Sudan Doctors' Network said that on Tuesday RSF fighters had \"cold bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present\".It gave no casualty figures, but said medical facilities in the city had been \"transformed into human slaughterhouses\".The Sudan Doctors Network has also accused the RSF of kidnapping six medics - including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse - and reportedly demanding ransoms in excess of $150,000 (£114,000) for their release.Tuesday's attack on Saudi Hospital was also reported by the el-Fasher Resistance Committee, a group of local activists, which said there was \"a horrifying silence\" afterwards.The city had been the army's last stronghold in the Darfur region, and was captured by the RSF on Sunday after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.New videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneSince the conflict erupted in April 2023, the RSF and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups - allegations the RSF denies.With the fall of el-Fasher, the UN, activists and aid agencies have expressed fear over the fate of the estimated 250,000 people trapped in the city, many from non-Arab communities.A communications blackout has made it difficult to confirm what is happening.BBC Verify has analysed new videos posted to social media showing RSF fighters executing a number of unarmed people in the last few days.With the difficulties in getting reports from the ground, aid agencies say the full scale of the devastation in and around el-Fasher is only beginning to emerge.Some people have managed to make the dangerous journey to the town of Tawila, about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher, and described the extreme violence they faced.\"The shelling was so intense on Saturday that we had no choice but to flee el-Fashir,\" one man told BBC Arabic's Sudan Lifeline programme.\"Along the way, the RSF filmed us and we were beaten and insulted - and they stole what we had on the journey. A number of people were captured and ransoms were demanded for their release.\"Some of those who were taken were later executed. During the journey, many people were arrested, and we suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.\"Jan Egeland, a former top UN humanitarian official, told the BBC the situation was catastrophic.\"We have had massacres on top on all of those months of deprivation, starvation, no medical care,\" he said.\"I think this is the worst place on Earth now; it's the biggest humanitarian emergency on Earth and it happens in the dark, really - there has been far too little attention to what's happening in Sudan.\"Dr Tedros said prior to the Saudi Hospital attack, the WHO had verified 185 attacks on health care facilities since the start of the war, resulting in 1,204 deaths.\"All attacks on health care must stop immediately and unconditionally. All patients, health personnel and health facilities must be protected under international humanitarian law. Ceasefire!\" he said.The capture of el-Fasher effectively splits the country, with the RSF now in control of most of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",

    "body": "Dozens dead in 'total devastation' left behind by Hurricane Melissa1 hour agoHurricane Melissa floods and destroys towns across CaribbeanGabriela Pomeroy and Nardine SaadHurricane Melissa has continued its devastating sweep across the Caribbean, decimating homes and infrastructure, flooding neighbourhoods and leaving dozens dead. The impact in Jamaica was clearer on Wednesday, after the island nation was targeted squarely by the category five monster - one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the region. At least five people have been confirmed dead there. At least another 20 died during flooding in Haiti as Melissa, now a category two storm, tears through the region. In Jamaica, people remain stranded on roofs and without power. Prime Minister Andrew Holness noted the \"total devastation\" across the island-nation. He added that \"80-90% of roofs were destroyed\", along with hospitals, libraries, police stations, port houses and other urban infrastructure.King Charles, who is the head of state in Jamaica, said in a statement that he is \"deeply concerned\" and \"profoundly saddened\" at the damage caused by Melissa in Jamaica and across the Caribbean.\"This most dreadful of record-breaking storms reminds us of the increasingly urgent need to restore the balance and harmony of Nature for the sake of all those whose lives and livelihoods may have been shattered by this heartbreaking disaster,\" he said.AFP via Getty ImagesFrom Jamaica, where the storm also caused mudslides, and palm trees to be tossed like toothpicks, Melissa moved north to Cuba as a category three storm, bringing  115 mph winds and heavy rain, and battering the south east of the island.What makes Melissa such a dangerous storm?'We are all terrified', say locals in path of Hurricane MelissaRovier Mesa Rodríguez, a video maker who lives in Santiago de Cuba, called the storm \"terrifying\" and described it sounding \"like a tornado\".Cuba President Miguel Díaz-Canel asked residents to \"not let their guard down\" and said that the country prepared for a worst-case scenario, which helped its response.On Wednesday night, the storm was 105 miles (170km) from the central Bahamas and expected to reach the Bahamas region overnight. Hurricane Melissa was moving north east with wind at 100 mph (155 km/h).  A dangerous storm surge is expected there before it moves further north toward Bermuda.A tropical storm warning is in place for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the speed of the slow-moving hurricane is expected to increase in the coming days. Hurricane Melissa - what we know about the damage in JamaicaIn Jamaica, three men and a woman were confirmed dead. They were discovered after being washed up by the flood waters in the storm, said Desmond McKenzie, Jamaica's minister of Local Government and Community Development.About three-quarters of the country lost electricity overnight.Richard Vernon, mayor of Montego Bay, told the BBC that half of the city had been cut off from the other by floods. He said the priority is to \"check if everybody is alive\".A resident in St Elizabeth sheltering in her four-bedroom home described the moment her roof blew off. Gordon Swaby, a businessman in Kingston, told the BBC that his first cousin's house was completely destroyed. His cousin - who he declined to name - recently moved from the United States to her \"dream\" house by the sea in the upscale Crane Road area. She lost the entire concrete structure and everything in it.\"She wanted a different kind of life,\" Gordon said. \"She chose the area because she loves the sea, so this is really devastating.\"Devastation was evident on Wednesday across central Jamaica. The city of Mandeville was flattened and the main road through town was littered with debris. Foliage was stuck to everything, and bits of building material were scattered along the road. Clean-up is expected to take months.Pia Chevallier, who is on holiday in Jamaica, said she felt \"sick with worry\" during the storm overnight. \"The windows didn't stop vibrating.\"Watch: Strong winds and flying debris as Hurricane Melissa makes landfallIn Haiti, at least 20 people - including 10 children - died in river floods, local authorities told AFP news agency.The island, which the country shares with the Dominican Republic, was struck by catastrophic flash flooding and landslides, which forced 3,000 people into shelters.\"Many homes have been washed away on the coast,\" said Pascal Bimenyimana from the Christian NGO, World Relief, in Port au Prince. Structures also lost their roofing and people were clearing the debris with their bare hands, he saidTorrential winds, violent rain and flooding destroyed crops across the country's south.The US is sending a disaster response team to Jamaica to assess the scale of need in the hurricane's aftermath. Formal requests for help came from Haiti and The Bahamas, according to senior State Department officials.The assistance comes in the wake of the Trump administration's closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was the world's biggest aid agency, amid cuts to foreign assistance by billions of dollars.Melissa is not expected to make landfall in North America, but will still be a formidable extratropical cyclone when it nears St Johns, Newfoundland, in Canada on Friday night.",

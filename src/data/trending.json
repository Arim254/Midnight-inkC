This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "Nine people were injured, one critically, after a car crashed into a crowd during a demolition derby in southeastern Australia, police said.The car had been taking part in a race in the town of Walcha on Saturday night when it drove through a fence and hit the grandstand, New South Wales police said in a statement.The race, part of the annual Walcha Motorcycle Rally, had been a demolition derby - a type of motorsport where drivers ram their vehicles into one another.Police said ages of the injured bystanders ranged from 20 to 75, while the critically injured person was a 54-year-old man. An investigation was underway, they said.Police said they were told that the 27-year-old driver of the car had been involved in a collision on the track right before it drove into the fence.In a statement published on the Walcha Motorcycle Rally's Facebook page, the Walcha Council said that it was \"shocked and stunned at the unfortunate accident\".The Council said it would work with authorities to \"examine the circumstances which led to the accident\". Giving any comments before concluding the inquiries would be \"inappropriate\", it said.Brendan Moylan, a member of parliament for Northern Tablelands, the region where Walcha is located, thanked emergency responders and other bystanders for their \"swift and incredibly professional work at the scene\". \"My thoughts are with everyone affected,\" he wrote on Facebook.Barnaby Joyce, former deputy prime minister and incumbent New England lawmaker, wrote on Facebook that his \"thoughts, prayer and hopes\" were with those injured in the crash.\"Such a sad end to such a great event,\" he wrote.The Walcha Motorcycle Rally describes itself as a \"grassroots event for motorcycle enthusiasts\".",

More than 1,500 people have died or gone missing in the Mediterranean in 2025 so far, according to data from the IOM. Around a third of those cases happened off Libya's coast.The North African nation was the departure point for the majority of the almost 59,000 people who arrived in Europe this year via the central Mediterranean route, according to Frontex, the European Union's border security agency. Earlier this week, dozens of migrants who boarded a small boat in Libya were missing and presumed dead after it capsized in the Mediterranean. Seven survivors - from Sudan, Somalia, Cameroon and Nigeria - were rescued after being lost at sea for nearly a week.",

    "body": "The Vatican has returned 62 indigenous artefacts to Canada, 100 years after they were taken from tribes to appear in a missionary museum in Rome. The items were given by Pope Leo XIV on Saturday to the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops (CCCB), which says it plans to return them to their original native communities. The move comes three years after Pope Francis issued a historic apology to Canada's First Nations for the church's role in the \"genocide\" and suppression of indigenous identity through the residential schools programme. A joint statement from the Vatican and the CCCB says the Pope \"desires that this gift represent a concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity\".The statement adds that the artefacts \"bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the indigenous peoples\".The items, which came from several different communities around Canada, had been sent by missionaries to Rome to appear in a 1925 exhibition that displayed over 100,000 items.Among the artefacts being returned is an Inuit kayak that had historically been used to hunt whales in Canada's far north, and a set of embroidered gloves that came from the Cree Nation.Canada's ambassador to the Holy See told CBC News that the items are currently in storage in Rome, and will be flown back to Canada on 6 December.In 2022, Pope Francis made a \"penitential pilgrimage\" across Canada, where he offered an apology to local tribal leaders. During the trip, the communities requested the return of their artefacts.The CCCB says the items will be transferred to Canada's National Indigenous Organizations which \"will then ensure that the artefacts are reunited with their communities of origin\".The cost of repatriating the items has been prepaid by the tribes, which plan to hold ceremonies before they can be officially returned, according to CBC.Canadian Foreign Minister praised the move, calling it, \"an important step that honours the diverse cultural heritage of Indigenous peoples and supports ongoing efforts toward truth, justice, and reconciliation\".The items had been held in the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The church has described the items as \"gifts\" that were given by tribal leaders. Critics have disputed this characterisation, given the power imbalance at the time they were transferred. The items were taken to Europe during a time when Canadian law, as well as Catholic decrees, prohibited native spiritual practices, leading to a ban on certain items used during ceremonies.",

Police protecting the compound used tear gas on the crowds.Authorities have arrested 20 people for crimes including robbery and assault, Mexico City security chief Pablo Vazquez told reporters.Protesters waved banners displaying messages including \"We are all Carlos Manzo\", while others wore cowboy hats in tribute to him.Manzo was shot on 1 November while he attended a Day of the Dead festival.He was known for speaking openly about drug-trafficking gangs in his town and cartel violence. He had been demanding tough action against armed cartel members who terrorise the country. Sheinbaum has been acting against cartels but resisting calls for another all-out war on drugs. Previous attempts by her predecessors have ended with bloody results.Days before the march took place, the president said the demonstration was being promoted by bots online.\"We agree with freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration if there are young people who have demands, but the issue here is who is promoting the demonstration,\" she said in a briefing. \"People should know how this demonstration was organised so that no one is used.\"Sheinbaum retains approval ratings above 70% in her first year in office, and has made in-roads in clamping down on fentanyl-trafficking – a key issue for her US counterpart, Donald Trump.But she has been criticised for failing to halt the violence gripping the country and is facing increased hostility from nearby countries.Earlier this month, Peru's Congress voted to declare Sheinbaum a persona non grata - or unwelcome in the country.The decision came days after Peru severed diplomatic ties with Mexico, after the Mexican government granted asylum to a former Peruvian prime minister facing charges for a 2022 coup attempt.",

    "body": "7 days agoNeve Gordon-FarleighCambridgeshireA rare wild orchid has been brought back from the brink of extinction by the work of dedicated conservationists.The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland's vascular plant red list has revealed that the Fen Orchid Liparis loeselii is officially no longer considered under threat in Britain. Cambridge University Botanic Garden has been working with Plantlife and Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to reintroduce and increase the number of Fen Orchids since 2008.Tim Pankhurst, former conservation manager at Plantlife, said: \"Playing a leading role in reducing the threat status of such a beautiful yet mercurial orchid is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a botanist and one I will always treasure.\"The Fen Orchid typically grows among reeds nestled in moss that retains moisture and relies on the presence of specific moss and fungi to grow. The primary cause of the plants decline has been habitat loss through drainage and abandonment of the fens.In 2010, the plant was only found at three sites in East Anglia and at one site in Wales.Now it has been recorded at seven sites in England and three in Wales - with its population in the UK exceeding 10,000 individual plants. Mr Pankhurst, who has dedicated his life's work to protecting the species before his retirement in April, says the most important aspect of the conservation project has been collaboration. \"As we face the enormous challenges of climate and biodiversity loss, this provides a moment of genuine hope for the future and is a testament to what dedicated partnership conservation work delivered consistently over many decades can deliver,\" he said.\"You don't achieve successes like this on your own.\"According to the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, this is the first time the Fen Orchid has successfully been cultivated in Great Britain.Peter Stroh, scientific officer at the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland, said the revision of the species threat status was \"excellent news\".He said: \"It's important to remember that the Fen Orchid remains a conservation-dependent species.\"The challenge now is to ensure that the Fen Orchid continues to thrive in its current locations and, either naturally or with a helping hand, flourish in former sites and new places within its native range in the coming years.\" ",

    "body": "The US will help South Korea build nuclear 'attack' submarines - here's what that means5 hours agoJake Kwon,Seoul and Gavin Butler,SingaporeReutersFile photo of a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarineSouth Korea's government has announced that it has finalised an agreement to build nuclear-powered submarines in partnership with the United States.The US has approved the \"attack submarines\" and agreed to cooperate in sourcing fuel, according to a fact sheet released by the White House on Thursday.The agreement marks a significant step in South Korea's relations with the US and comes amid a period of growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula: with the nuclear-armed North Korea, and an expansionist China to the west.Here's what you need to know about the agreement. What's in the agreement? The agreement between the US and South Korea comes as leaders from both countries reached a broad trade deal earlier last month that would see reciprocal tariffs cut to 15% from 25%. US President Donald Trump had slapped a tariff rate on Seoul of 25% earlier this year - which his counterpart Lee Jae Myung managed to negotiate down to 15%, after Seoul said it would invest $350bn (£265bn) in the US, including $200bn in cash investment and $150bn in shipbuilding.In a White House readout released on Thursday, the US said it had \"given approval for the Republic of Korea to build nuclear-powered attack submarines... [and would] work closely to advance requirements for this project, including avenues to source fuel\".In an earlier post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump had said the vessels would be constructed at a shipyard in Philadelphia run by South Korean conglomerate Hanwha.Only six countries currently possess nuclear-powered strategic submarines: the US, China, Russia, the UK, France and India.South Korea already possesses about 20 submarines, but they are all diesel propelled and therefore need to surface far more frequently. Nuclear submarines are also able to operate further and faster.\"I have given them approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, rather than the old-fashioned, and far less nimble, diesel-powered submarines that they have now,\" Trump had wrote on Truth Social.South Korea is a powerhouse when it comes to civilian nuclear energy. It had a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s but gave it up following US pressure. And so its ability to enrich or reprocess uranium is limited by the US as it is entirely dependent on imports. Why does South Korea want nuclear submarines? The latest vessel programme is aimed at countering North Korea, which recently revealed that it was pursuing its own nuclear submarine programme.President Lee had told Trump at the APEC summit last month that South Korea needed them for that express purpose.In a TV interview last week, Ahn Gyu-back, South Korea's Minister of Defence, said that nuclear submarines would be a \"proud achievement\" for South Korea, and a major leap in strengthening the country's defence against the North.The stealth of nuclear submarines would keep North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"awake at night\", he added. Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump met his Korean counterpart in South Korea last monthDoes North Korea have nuclear submarines?North Korea has also been pursuing a nuclear submarine programme – possibly with Russia's help, according to South Korean officials.In March 2025, North Korea unveiled pictures of what it claimed was a nuclear-powered submarine that was under construction, showing Kim visiting the shipyard. Pyongyang is expected to have the submarines within the next few years.North Korea is also estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons, as part of its broader nuclear weapons programme.Jo Bee-yun, a research fellow at the Sejong Institute, suggested that Seoul's acquisition of nuclear submarines will help it stay apace in East Asia's escalating arms race.\"North Korea's nuclear weapon is an established fact,\" she told the BBC. \"[South Korea acquiring] nuclear submarines is only a step in the larger trend of rising tension.\"Will this inflame tensions on the Korean Peninsula?It is unclear how much the nuclear-propelled submarines will contribute to South Korea's defence capabilities – and though they are very expensive, they don't quite change the balance of power on the Korean Peninsula, according to some experts.Yang Uk, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that the nuclear subs' primary purpose is to assure South Korean voters that their government is responding to North Korea's nuclear threat.\"South Korea cannot develop its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea's,\" Dr Yang said. \"What's something that they can do? Fielding nuclear submarines.\"Dr Yang believes North Korea might revel in the change, however, because it reinforces their justification to hold on to nuclear weapons – meaning it will become more difficult to demand that Pyongyang give up its nuclear arsenal.Jo nonetheless emphasised the strategic advantage that South Korea stands to gain from the new submarine deal, describing it as a \"major change\" which \"means South Korea is now a regional player\". \"The best feature of a nuclear submarine is its speed,\" she said. \"It can now go fast and far and South Korea can operate together with more countries.\"What's in it for the United States?For Washington, support for South Korea's nuclear-powered submarine programme likely aims to put pressure on both North Korea and China.\"Trump has put the burden of defence spending on the back of South Korea,\" Dr Yang explained. \"South Korea will greatly expand its defence budget. They will act as America's proxy in putting pressure on China and North Korea.\"Getty ImagesDonald Trump is attempting to counter the influence of other nations in South Korea, according to expertsUS and China have long competed for strategic influence in South Korea, leaving Seoul to walk a geopolitical tightrope. More recently, China has been increasing its naval activity near South Korea's maritime border – a move akin to those seen in the South China Sea.Beijing must be \"furious\" about South Korea's nuclear submarine agreement with the US, Dr Yang said.Following the deal's announcement, the Chinese Ambassador to South Korea, Dai Bing, said he hoped South Korea would \"deal with this issue prudently, taking into consideration the concerns of all sides\".Dai also added that Beijing was engaging with Seoul on the matter through diplomatic channels, and emphasised that \"the (security) situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the region is still complex and sensitive\".What next?Although President Trump said the submarines would be built in Philadelphia and bring jobs to the US, South Korean officials have maintained they must be built locally, where existing facilities can deliver them in a much shorter timeline.South Korea's Prime Minister Kim Min-seok had himself said during a parliamentary hearing that the South Korean owned shipyard in Philadelphia did \"not have the capability\" to build such vessels, according to reports. Hanwha, who owns the shipyard, has yet to comment on the matter. But now that an agreement has been reached, the next step is to adjust the nuclear agreement between the two countries, allowing for the US to provide nuclear fuel and to set the fence for its military use.",

    "description": "People granted asylum in the UK will have to wait 20 years before they can apply to settle permanently, under plans due to be announced by Home Secret",
    "body": "People granted asylum in the UK will have to wait 20 years before they can apply to settle permanently, under plans due to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood on Monday.The major shake-up to asylum policy comes as the government seeks to reduce small boat crossings and asylum claims.Under the plans, people who are granted asylum will only be allowed to stay in the country temporarily, with their refugee status regularly reviewed and those whose home countries are then deemed safe told to return.Currently refugee status lasts for five years, after which people can apply for indefinite leave to remain. Now the home secretary wants to cut the initial period from five years to two-and-a-half years, after which refugee status will be regularly reviewed.But she plans to significantly lengthen the time it will take to gain permanent residence in the UK from five years to 20.Mahmood told the Sunday Times the reforms were \"designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat\".She continued: \"Illegal migration is tearing our country apart\", adding that it was the government's job to \"unite our country\".\"If we don't sort this out, I think our country becomes much more divided,\" she told the newspaper.The policy has been copied from Denmark, where a government led by the centre-left Social Democrats has presided over one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.In Denmark, refugees are given temporary residence permits, typically of two years, and in effect have to re-apply for asylum when they expire.And Mahmood's new approach will certainly face opposition from some Labour MPs.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said it was \"right the government looks at new ways to fix the disorderly asylum system created by the Conservatives\".He added that Labour \"shouldn't kid itself that these measures are an alternative to processing claims quickly so we can remove those with no right to be here\".Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, described the government's plans as \"harsh and unnecessary\", and said they \"won't deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoLinda Pressly and Esperanza Escribano,BarcelonaBBCMarina Freixa always knew there was something dark and unspoken about her family.Her mother had grown up under Spain's decades-long dictatorship, which ended in 1975, but the details of her childhood were hazy.Then everything changed one Christmas a decade ago - when Marina was about 20.That winter's evening around the table, with a cloud of cigarette smoke suspended in the air and wine glasses drained, Marina's mother, Mariona Roca Tort, began to speak.Els Buits (documentary film)Several years ago, Mariona (left) revealed the truth about her adolescence to Marina and her cousins\"My parents reported me to the authorities,\" Mariona told them. \"They put me in a reformatory when I was 17.\"Reformatories were institutions where girls and young women who refused to conform to the Franco regime's Catholic values were detained - single mothers, girls with boyfriends, lesbians. Girls who'd been sexually assaulted were incarcerated, assuming the blame for their own abuse. Orphans and abandoned girls might also find themselves living behind convent walls.Marina and her cousins were stunned.They couldn't comprehend that their grandparents had arranged to have their own daughter locked up.Mariona's memory of telling this story to the youngsters in her family is blurred, she believes as a result of the psychiatric \"treatment\" she was forced to undergo at the reformatory. But Marina didn't forget the revelations, and years later, she would make a documentary telling her mother's story.Mariona is a survivor of the Patronato de Protección a la Mujer - the Women's Protection Board. Under dictator Francisco Franco, it oversaw a nationwide network of residential institutions managed by religious organisations. There's no definitive information about how many institutions were involved or how many girls were affected.Thursday will mark 50 years since Franco's death. Spain has since seen a revolution in women's rights - but survivors of the Patronato are still waiting for answers and are now demanding an inquiry.Family handoutAs a teenager, Mariona encountered people resisting the Spanish dictatorshipWarning: This article contains content that some readers might find distressingMariona, the oldest of nine siblings, describes her parents as right-wing and ultra-Catholic. They were so conservative they wouldn't even let Mariona wear trousers.But in 1968, when she turned 16, a new world unfolded.Mariona was tutoring children during the day, and preparing for university at evening classes. There, she says, she met people she'd never encountered before - trade unionists, left-wingers and anti-Franco activists. It was the year of global protests against authoritarianism and the Vietnam War, with mass demands for civil rights. The spirit of revolt was infectious.Franco had been in power for three decades. Political parties were banned, censorship was universal and young people wanted change. Soon, Mariona joined her new friends on \"raids\": a few of them would block off a street, throw Molotov cocktails, hand out leaflets, and when the police turned up, scatter in every direction.On May Day 1969, one of Mariona's friends was arrested at a demonstration in Barcelona. There was a risk the detainee would give names to the police - so Mariona couldn't go home, in case they came looking for her. That night she stayed in the flat of a fellow activist.Returning home the next day, Mariona was in deep trouble. Her parents were furious, and began to exert far more control over her life.\"For them, it was a scandal, a stain on the family,\" she says. \"After that, they wouldn't let me out.\"By the end of that summer, Mariona had resolved to leave home, and travelled to the holiday island of Menorca with some college friends, leaving her parents a note.They immediately reported her as an underage runaway to the authorities, and the moment Mariona was about to board a boat back to Barcelona, she was arrested.AlamyMariona's escape from Barcelona in 1969 was short-livedAt the port in Barcelona her parents met her.They didn't take her home. Instead, they took her to a convent. Mariona wasn't given any explanation - she only remembers her parents' rage.Days later she flew to Madrid with her father. There, she was driven directly to another convent, part of the Patronato system, under Spain's Ministry of Justice.She and the other interned women were categorised and segregated.Mariona says she ended up on the first floor - reserved for \"the rebellious ones - the ones they considered fallen women\".The Patronato had the power to detain any non-conforming woman under 25. They weren't criminals - they were females deemed in need of \"re-education\".  But Mariona never learned the stories of the others she was confined with.\"They didn't let us talk.  It's quite incredible,\" she says. \"And you wonder, how did they manage it?\"The internees were only allowed to exchange simple greetings with each other - a form of control, and a way of preventing \"bad\" girls influencing others.\"What you couldn't do was really get to know another girl,\"  says Mariona. \"Because then they'd separate you - send one of you to a different dormitory, or even to another institution.\"She thinks there were around 100 internees at the convent. They slept 20 to a room, with a nun at one end, and the door locked. The daily routine was gruelling - prayers, Mass, cleaning the convent, and then hours in a workshop making clothes for local retailers. While the girls sewed, a nun read aloud so that no-one talked.\"There was indoctrination,\" recalls Mariona. \"So that you should understand you'd behaved very badly. Then once you realised this, you'd ask for forgiveness and confess.\"Mariona never confessed.Marina FreixaIn her diary, Mariona wrote: \"Father says I must choose. Live a proper family life, or leave home forever.\"After around four months, she was allowed to return home to Barcelona for Christmas, but wasn't permitted to go out alone. Somehow - and Mariona doesn't remember how - she managed to escape, but her escape was short lived. Within hours she was bundled into a car with her father and an uncle, and driven back to Madrid.\"We arrived back at the convent at dusk,\" she recalls. \"I refused to go in. They pulled me up the stairs and gave me a sedative to get me inside.\"Inside the convent, the other young women were warned against talking to her - the rebel girl who had the nerve to try to run away. She grew intensely lonely, and eventually began refusing food.Dramatic weight loss resulted in her admission to a psychiatric clinic. There, she says she was given two sessions of electric shock treatment, followed by what was called \"insulin coma therapy\".Mariona says she was injected with insulin to induce deep hypoglycemia - a coma-like state caused by low blood sugar. It was believed this could reduce psychotic or schizophrenic symptoms, and somehow \"re-set\" a patient's brain. It was a \"therapy\" that was being discontinued in many countries for one simple reason: it could be lethal.Mariona received an insulin injection in the mornings. Later she'd be brought out of the coma and made to eat. Mentally, she began to shut down.\"Everyday, I was more dazed. I started saying things like, 'I hurt my parents,'\" she says.\"I entered this process of submission and acceptance.\"Mariona believes the forced, intravenous \"treatment\" with insulin irreparably damaged her memory. Suspecting it was causing her to forget things, she began keeping a diary. More than five decades later, this faded, paper document from 1971 would inform Marina's documentary about her mother's experience.Doctors believed the \"treatment\" would help Mariona gain weight - but that wasn't happening. \"One day, the psychiatrist decided it was better to try tying me to the bed until I ate.\"Mariona's despair became so unbearable, she says she thought about taking her own life. Then the psychiatrist gave her a target weight of 40kg (6st 4lb). If she achieved that, they promised she'd be released from the clinic.Mariona Roca TortWhen Mariona was released from the Patronato, she never returned to live with her parents againMariona succeeded. In 1972, once she'd grown a little stronger, she returned to Barcelona.Now aged 20, she vowed to never live with her parents again.These were the final years of Franco's dictatorship before his death in 1975. Mariona moved from job to job, eventually forging a career as a TV director. She had children of her own, but her relationship with her parents remained cool.At some point, Mariona asked her mother why she'd been sent to the Patronato. Her mother only said: \"We made a mistake.\"Mariona's father is in his 90s now. \"We suffered a lot too,\" he told her when she asked him about the family decision to have her locked up in Madrid.For Marina, learning more about her mother's story has complicated her relationship with her grandfather.\"I can't force myself to love someone who's caused so much pain - who treated my mother very badly.\"The short documentary Marina produced about her mother's experience of the Patronato is called Els Buits - Catalan for \"the spaces\" - a reference to the blanks in Mariona's memory. The film has won prizes in Spain, and was nominated for a prestigious Goya Award.Esperanza EscribanoMariona and Marina are touring with the documentary film, which Marina believes shows the institutions were a \"systematic\" part of Spain's historyFifty years after the death of Franco, the film has contributed to a groundswell of calls for the interned women to be formally recognised under the law as victims of Spain's dictatorship. Spain's Minister for Democratic Memory, Ángel Víctor Torres, said his government was open to looking at the case of the Patronato survivors.Meanwhile, Marina and Mariona are on tour with the film, taking it to community screenings.\"Women come and tell their stories – it's like a door opened to something unknown, and that's very powerful,\" says Marina. \"People think what happened in their own home was an isolated incident. We try to say: this history isn't individual, it was systematic.\"Her mother Mariona still doubts her memory sometimes.But, she says, \"seeing it all reflected in the film, that gives it the weight of truth.\"If you've been affected by issues involving suicide or feelings of despair, details of organisations offering advice and support for people in the UK are available from BBC Action Line.

    "body": "2 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

    "body": "37 minutes agoDearbail JordanGetty ImagesAlex Honnold was the first climber to perform a rope-free ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite National ParkAn American climber has postponed scaling the Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings, rope-free for another 24 hours due to wet weather.     Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

So we were in a little convoy of blown tyres.\"It was actually a moment when I thought we're not going to make it to the finish,\" she said.Luckily, the Germans had large equipment so they could change the Land Rover's tyres and helped make sure Kirk and Tait-Wright were on the final stretch to the finish line.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteKirk and Tait-Wright had to drive through a range of terrains, including sand dunes\"They helped us get back on our way, we set off but we still had 80 kilometres to do without any spares.\"The worry was then if we blew another tyre, that was it. That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Why are there so few South Asian footballers at the top?5 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi de Souza,BBC Newsbeat PFAThe Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme is run by the Professional Footballers' AssociationThe number of South Asian men playing professional football in England has almost doubled since the 2021-22 season, when the Football Association (FA) launched a strategy to boost participation in the game.But the numbers don't tell the whole story.While there were 28 professional South Asian players in England last season - compared with 16 five years ago - they represent just over 1% of those competing at an elite level.But the interest is there - the FA reports that within England more South Asian people are playing, coaching and refereeing across all levels of the game.Within South Asian communities, more than 11% of adult males and more than 15% of adult females are participating in football, it says.There is no shortage of talent - but why are so few players struggling to break through to the top?Players tells BBC Newsbeat tired myths, cultural expectations and lack of infrastructure are some of the reasons why.'We've experienced this for decades'Natine WilliamsMarva Kreel is a footballer presenter and played for Tottenham as a child\"It's good more conversations are happening, but it's something that a lot of us have been experiencing for decades,\" says journalist and presenter Marva Kreel.Marva, who is of part South-Asian heritage, has been involved in girls' and women's football since childhood and once played for Tottenham as a youth. \"When I looked around, the players that were playing on the pitch didn't represent my local area,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"They didn't represent who I was going to school with, it was a very white space.\"Marva says physical barriers, such as distant training grounds, stopped some of her friends from progressing to higher levels. \"You couldn't get to training. You couldn't get to your games in the same way that boys could and that my boy mates could, because we didn't have coaches laid on for us,\" she says.Marva says certain assumptions can count out promising South Asian talent. \"A lot of this comes down to shared problems that we have in the South Asian community of how South Asian boys and how South Asian girls might be stereotyped amongst football,\" she says.'Told we would never make it'PFARiz Rehman runs a programme which helps mentor South Asian footballing talentIt's a situation Riz Rehman experienced himself.\"We were told that we would never make it because you've got the wrong diet, you're playing towards education, not sport,\" he recalls.Riz's brother, Zesh, was the first British South Asian to play in the Premier League.He had hopes of forging a similar career but had to stop playing due to injury.Now a coach, he worked with the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to set up the Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme (AIMS), which supports Asian footballers at all levels by setting them up with mentors putting on workshops.\"AIMS will give support to any player on the elite pathway,\" says the 43-year-old, referring to the phases aspiring pros must go through.Riz says he wants to give others the chances and understanding that he and his brother missed out on.\"We obviously defeated those odds and we wanted to give every single player on the elite pathway a helping hand so that it is possible they can make it in the game as well,\" he says. The PFA says Loughborough University is carrying out an independent evaluation of AIMS to help it understand the programme's impact and shape its future.'Mentoring has massive impact'Getty ImagesMariam Mahmood currently plays for WrexhamMalvind Singh Benning, who plays for League Two side Shrewsbury Town, took part in the AIMS programme and is now a mentor.He recalls seeing only two players of South Asian heritage as he came up in his career.\"I'm 32 now so passing on real-life experience in the professional games to these young lads will be massive,\" he says. The PFA reports \"steady progress\" in getting more South Asian players into clubs but there is a way to go - particularly for women. Mariam Mahmood, who plays for Wrexham, says representation also hinges on role models.\"When people see other people's success stories and more publicity on people that are getting success in football, I think it will motivate other players and different people to also get involved and think: 'Oh, if they can do it, I can do it',\" says the 21-year-old.Mariam says she was \"lucky\" to cut her teeth in an inclusive academy but believes better representation starts at grassroots level, which feeds into the talent pool for bigger clubs. \"The important thing is to get [South Asians] playing football, develop them until they're 16, 17, so they can sign professional contracts and get into that pool of people.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "35 minutes agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump threatened to hit Canada with a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if the country's prime minister strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday. Tensions between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have escalated in recent days, after Carney gave a speech in Davos, Switzerland, pushing against the world's great powers.He recently met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced their countries had reached a trade deal that included electric vehicles.At the time, Trump hailed the potential deal as \"a good thing\". It is unclear if that deal has come into effect, or if Trump was referring to it specifically. The BBC has reached out to the White House, Carney's office and Canada's minister responsible for US-Canada trade for comment.In his Saturday post, Trump referred to the prime minister as \"Governor Carney\" and  wrote that if \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"Trump did not provide a timeline or more information about the threatened tariff. Last year, when he first threatened new tariffs on the US northern neighbour, Trump began calling Canada the US's \"51st state\" with Carney as its \"governor\", and suggested he may try to acquire the country entirely. While the countries' relationship had been improving in recent months, Trump's push to take control of Greenland and his comments about Nato had put him at odds with Canadian and European leaders. Carney did not mention the president by name in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week, but he still angered Trump.\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said in his own address, which followed Carney's.",

    "body": "2 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringUkraine is now living through its most difficult winter in recent memory. With January temperatures plummeting below -15C, Russia has been attacking energy infrastructure, leaving about a million Ukrainians without heating.The capital, Kyiv, is the main target of such attacks. Following the latest Russian bombardment overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. \"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. \"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. \"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift8 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their job, under the terms of a phased scheme similar to ones for lawyers or doctors. Some senior figures in policing fear the scheme will be \"expensive\" and \"time consuming,\" and could undermine vetting processes already in place. Under separate proposals announced on Friday, ministers will be granted new powers to dismiss chief constables and intervene in forces deemed to be failing. The plans are part of a raft of reforms expected from Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who is promising to oversee the biggest shake-up of policing in decades. Officers will have to renew what the Home Office calls a 'licence to practice' throughout their career by keeping up to date with latest methods and guidance. Training will be rolled out in phases. The aim is that the new standardised programme will be clearer to follow across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. \"Every police officer needs to remain match fit to protect their communities. As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly\", Crime and Policing Minister Sarah Jones said. \"The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran.\" But Matt Cane, general secretary of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said he feared the license would become \"an expensive, time-consuming, tick-box exercise\".He said that training was \"already inadequate\", and pointed out that police already carry warrant cards and go through vetting processes in order to practice. Last week it was announced the home secretary will be given new powers to sack police chiefs. On Friday, additional statutory powers were extended to ministers, who will be able to force the \"retirement, resignation, or suspension\" of police chief constables if they are performing poorly. Currently, only police and crime commissioners hold that power. Ministers will also be able to send in \"specialist teams\" to turn around forces if crime solving rates or police response times are poor.The government said that new targets on policing will also be introduced, and made available to the public. \"It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces,\" Mahmood said in a statement. It comes after Mahmood last week said she had lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable Craig Guildford after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa. He later retired from the force. Sir Andy Cooke, who leads His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), welcomed the plans. The body independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces. \"Where a police force is failing the public, there must be a clear, fair system to make sure concerns are acted upon. The inspectorate is a vital part of that system,\" he said. \"These reforms will help make sure under-performance is more quickly addressed whilst supporting forces to respond to our recommendations more effectively, so that every community gets the policing it deserves.\"On Monday, as part of her reforms plan, the home secretary will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime.Reacting to news of the cuts, the Police Federation of England and Wales said: \"Policing's current structure has entrenched a postcode lottery in what the public see but also how officers are led, supported and treated.\"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"That body's largest branch, the Metropolitan Police Federation, also voiced its concerns about what is being proposed, saying: \"We all want the highest standards in policing but we fear this will be an expensive, time-consuming, tick-box exercise and become bureaucratic and burdensome\" on a service it says is \"already stretched\".",

    "body": "Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks11 hours agoGavin ButlerGetty ImagesThere are manifold reasons why recorded shark encounters are rising in Australia's oceans - but fatalities are relatively rareIt's \"extraordinary\", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15-kilometre stretch of Australia's east coast.On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km (186 miles) up the coast.\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.The rapid spate of incidents triggered local and international alarm, with dozens of beaches closed amid fear of further attacks. Predictably, calls for shark culls have gathered momentum and volume.Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.There are multiple factors that likely contributed to the recent spate of incidents, they say – and it's not the sharks that are the problem.Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127 millimetres of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"Are shark attacks increasing overall?Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".Getty ImagesDozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coastOlive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"Do shark culls work?In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.Experts reject the suggestion.\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"How can people avoid shark attacks?Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"",

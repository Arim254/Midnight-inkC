    "body": "2 hours agoLaura GozziARNAUD FINISTRE/AFPFrédéric Péchier faces a minimum of 22 years behind barsA former anaesthetist has been jailed for life for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, including 12 who died.A court in the city of Besançon in eastern France found Frédéric Péchier guilty of contaminating infusion bags with substances that caused cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging.His youngest victim, a four-year-old child, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. His first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.",

    "body": "A Briton who fought in Ukraine has been sentenced to 13 years in a maximum-security prison, the Russian Prosecutor-General's office has said.Hayden Davies, a former British soldier who Russia has called a mercenary, was reportedly captured in Ukraine's Donbas region in late 2024 or early 2025 while serving with the country's foreign legion.He was tried in a Russian-controlled court in the city of Donetsk, which is currently occupied by Moscow. The UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has been contacted for comment. It had previously described charges against Mr Davies and another Briton captured in Ukraine as \"false\" and said the pair were prisoners of war.In a statement earlier this year, the FCDO condemned the detention of both Mr Davies and James Anderson.\"They are not mercenaries. They are prisoners of war,\" it said.\"Ukraine has confirmed that both are members of Ukrainian Armed Forces. They must be provided all the rights and protections afforded to prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions,\" the FCDO added.In a statement, Russian prosecutors said Mr Davies joined the Ukrainian army in August 2024 and \"took part in military operations against the Russian armed forces on the territory of [Donetsk Region]\".In court footage released by prosecutors, a man with a British accent speaks via a translator from inside a barred cage, which is standard practice for many Russian hearings.The man said he was a member of the Ukrainian Army's foreign legion and travelled to Ukraine by bus via Poland.He said he was paid $400 (£300) or $500 a month as a salary. When asked if he pleaded guilty to the charge, the man said \"yeah\" and nodded his head.It is not clear whether he was speaking under duress.Mr Anderson was jailed for 19 years in March after being charged with terrorism and mercenary activity.The 22-year-old was the first British national to be convicted by Russia during the war.",

    "body": "Sir Chris Hoy is in his kitchen, chatting about early-morning coffee and fry-ups.And mindsets.An Olympic champion's mindset to be exact.An exacting, leave-no-stone-unturned, meticulous mindset that defined a career in which he won six gold medals and one silver across four Olympic Games.This is the same mindset he is relying on more than ever to reframe his entire existence and purpose following a terminal cancer diagnosis.\"We normally have a fry-up for breakfast but, when you guys are here, we need to make an effort,\" he jokes.The \"you\" in this instance are the BBC cameras that have been following Hoy and his family and friends for the past 12 months for the documentary Sir Chris Hoy: Cancer, Courage and Me.The programme will be broadcast for the first time at 21:00 GMT on Thursday, 18 December on BBC One and available from 22:00 GMT on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.It shows a hopeful, yet raw, portrayal of the realities of living with stage four cancer, while it also brings to life Hoy's realisation that he can use his platform as a force for raising awareness, and money, for other people living with the illness.As he weighs his coffee – perhaps the number one area where Hoy's obsessive eye for detail manifests itself – the Scot is in an upbeat mood, laughing and joking with wife Sarra about their imagined usual morning scenario of a full English breakfast compared to the omelette and green homemade smoothie they are actually tucking into.It has not been anywhere near this rosy for much of the past two years, however, as Hoy explains a few minutes later when the cameras are rolling properly.\"It's about five miles from the hospital back home,\" he says, describing his return journey from seeing doctors after learning of his cancer diagnosis in September 2023. \"I just walked back in a daze. I don't remember the walk. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell Sarra? What am I going to say?\"As soon as I said the words, I broke down.\"What Hoy had to articulate was a terminal cancer diagnosis. Incurable secondary bone cancer. Between two and four years to live.\"In my sporting career it used to be about process, not outcome,\" he says. \"Focus on what you have control over. But if you win or lose, it's not life and death.\"[After the diagnosis] the stakes have changed dramatically. The principle is the same – but now it is life and death.\"Hoy has shrewdly taken on support for this difficult time in his life.Steve Peters is a man that Hoy knew could make a difference.The list of sportspeople that Peters has worked with - the public list he is happy to talk about on the record - is a high-profile 'who's who' ranging from Steven Gerrard to Ronnie O'Sullivan.The donkeys in the front paddock of the psychiatrist's countryside home bely that glitzy, glamourous list.But their tranquil nature make complete sense when you spend a few hours in the company of Peters and Hoy.Peters was Hoy's first port of call throughout his career when it came to training and calming his mind to be at its peak in and around Olympic competition.He was also one of the first people Hoy called when he got his terminal diagnosis last year.At first Peters was part of the firefighting phase of what Hoy's wife Sarra describes as a \"deep grief\" in the first few days post-diagnosis.But in time, with Peters' help, Hoy set about finding a new purpose.Firstly, it is to raise awareness of the limitations of the current provision for prostate cancer in the UK. Both Hoy's father and grandfather have had prostate cancer.Understandably, given an earlier diagnosis could have shifted his diagnosis from terminal to manageable, the 49-year-old Scot argues eloquently that a national screening programme should be made a priority for men from their 45th birthday onwards.But, crucially, his approach is also to show other people living with cancer that sport and exercise can still be a positive part of their lives, even through their treatment.Peters explains: \"What Chris did when he was presented with this illness is he said: 'Right, what's the plan?' After we worked through the initial stages of the shock and grief of it, then he came out the other side and he picked up on the purpose.\"And that was to reach other people. It became a mission for him.\"Peters knows all too well how unstoppable Hoy can be when a mission takes him over.The pair have now worked together for more than 20 years, with perhaps their crowning moment coming at the Athens 2004 Games.It was in the Greek capital that Peters' \"pink elephant\" technique helped Hoy win his first Olympic gold. In the run-up to Athens, Peters had encouraged Hoy to pre-empt a scenario in which his rivals broke the world record in the men's kilometre time trial before the Scot had his chance to ride. The scenario became reality on three occasions, but rather than falter, Hoy, the last to ride, responded with a world record of his own to take gold.The mindset of that moment is one he is tapping into again with his approach to cancer. Control the controllables, but don't waste time worrying about the end result.Just like in Athens.\"As I went to the start line, a personal best would have got me third,\" Hoy remembers.\"Recognising what you have control over is such an important part of life. Focus on what you have control over - but the outcome itself, you don't have control over.\"Steve helped me to access the best of myself, and get the best out of myself.\"The BBC Breakfast and BBC Sport cameras witnessed Hoy, with the help of Lady Sarra - who herself is dealing with her own diagnosis of multiple sclerosis - making the best of his cancer diagnosis in the last 12 months.They have followed Hoy and his family to doctor and physio appointments and out on mountain bike rides in Wales with a GB Olympic cycling A-list group of riders and friends.That same cast list turned out in Glasgow in September as Hoy and a host of his supporters took his cycling fundraising event the Tour de Four from concept to delivery inside a few months.'Overwhelming' response to Hoy missionIt is just after 9am in a back room of the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow – a few minutes before Hoy's charity mass participation cycling event, the Tour de Four, is due to get under way.The ride was set up, and given its title, in an effort to change perceptions around stage four cancer.Every time the door opens, a member of British Olympic and Paralympic royalty walks through it.Sir Mark Cavendish, Sir Jason Kenny, Becky James, Dani King, Sir Ben Ainslie, Sir Steve Redgrave, Dame Sarah Storey...In and among the clip-clop of cycling cleats comes another sporting knight.This one is wearing tennis shoes.Hoy goes over to check in with Sir Andy Murray about his readiness and is met with a typical sardonic quip from his fellow Scot.Hoy asks: \"Are you feeling ready mate?\"\"Well, I've got the kit,\" Murray responds.As it turns out, the two-time Wimbledon champion was woefully ill-prepared – completing the ride in tennis shoes and boxer shorts. Not typical road cycling gear, but typical of the response of Hoy's friends to his diagnosis.\"The response of friends has been quite overwhelming at times,\" Hoy says.The friend response has been mirrored by that of the public.September's Tour de Four raised more than £3m for cancer charities across the UK.However, the highs of that success were followed in November by the UK National Screening Committee's recommendation that a prostate screening cancer programme for all men in the UK was not justified.For Hoy, the fight to raise money and raise awareness is his new Olympic-sized mission and his response therefore was dignified, yet resolutely determined.\"I was quite astonished,\" he said. \"I can't believe that the answer to this situation is to sit on your hands and do nothing. There are 10,000 men a year in the UK who find out they have prostate cancer too late – it's incurable.\"We're failing these men if we don't do something proactive. Regardless, I'm going to keep pushing.\"Again, we meet his Olympic-honed mindset, targeted on a bigger mission.\"The Olympics was something that was my life for so many years and drove me on,\" Hoy says.\"I'm still incredibly proud of it now and I look back with great fondness, but this is something on an entirely different level.\"It's more important than riding bikes in anti-clockwise circles, put it that way.\"",

Here she is showing her togetherness with her family.The photos appear to be from the same shoot used to capture photos for George's 12th and Louis' seventh birthdays.Last year, the couple revealed a Christmas card with a personal significance, using a picture taken from the video released when Catherine announced the end of her chemotherapy.In January, she announced she was in remission from cancer while making an emotional return to the hospital where she received treatment.A few months later William and Catherine celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary during an official visit to the Isle of Mull in Scotland.And in August the couple were preparing to move into their \"forever home\" in Forest Lodge, Windsor.William and Catherine are spending the festive season together and are expected to be joining the King and rest of the royal family at Sandringham in Norfolk on Christmas Day.Earlier this month, King Charles and Queen Camilla released their own Christmas card, showing them in Rome.The photograph, taken in April during their state visit to Italy, shows the smiling couple standing side by side on a garden path.",

    "body": "Archaeologists uncover 3,000-year-old mysterious mass burial site6 hours agoGiancarlo RinaldiSouth Scotland reporterGuard ArchaeologyTightly-packed urns containing human remains were found on the siteNewly published research has revealed a \"mysterious mass burial event\" in the south of Scotland about 3,300 years ago.Excavations were undertaken in 2020 and 2021 by Guard Archaeology during the construction of the access route to the Twentyshilling Wind Farm near Sanquhar in Dumfries and Galloway.It revealed a Bronze Age barrow - an ancient burial mound - with the cremated bones of several people contained inside five closely-packed urns.Archaeologist Thomas Muir, who led the excavation, said it appeared that some kind of \"horrible event\" such as famine had led to so many burials at the same time.Guard ArchaeologyThe site was examined in 2020 and 2021 before the wind farm became operationalThe wind farm sits about three miles (4.8km) south of Sanquhar on open rough upland terrain.During their work, Guard Archaeology found the urns with the cremated bones of at least eight individuals all placed there in one mass burial event some time between 1439 and 1287 BC.A small group of pits some distance north was also excavated, revealing late Neolithic activity between 2867 and 2504 BC.\"The five urns in the Twentyshilling Barrow contained at least eight individuals,\" said Mr Muir.\"The urns were deposited at the same time as they were packed tightly within the pit and adhered to the same 15th to 13th Century BC date range.\"He said that indicated that it was a single mass burial, \"possibly of the same family or group\".Guard ArchaeologyA number of people died in a short space of time in the area\"What is significant about the Twentyshilling remains is that they were cremated and then buried almost immediately,\" he said.He said that was unusual as there was \"quite a tradition\" in the Bronze Age of leaving bodies out for some time, as seen on another dig at Broughton in the Borders.\"That had been reopened a few times and reused so it has been used by a community over a long period of time,\" he said.\"Whereas what we have at Twentyshilling is some sort of horrible event must have happened to the community - possibly famine - and a lot of people have died within a very short period of each other.\"The Bronze Age in the area may have been a \"time of particular stress\" as other burial sites in the region show evidence of famine and abandonment.The archaeological work at Twentyshilling was a required condition of planning permission for the wind farm which is now fully operational.",

    "body": "2 hours agoWatch: Mother of teenage sextortion victim encourages parents to be open to uncomfortable conversationsA Scottish couple whose teenage son took his own life after being blackmailed on Instagram are suing the platform's owner Meta, in what's thought to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray Dowey, from Dunblane, was 16 when he became a victim of sextortion in December 2023.His parents have now launched legal action against Meta in a US court seeking punitive damages claiming that Instagram was not safe.Meta, which also owns Facebook, said it supports law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind sextortion, adding \"we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts\".Murray Dowey was 16 when he took his own lifeIt is thought Murray had been tricked by criminals in West Africa.Murray died in his home in Dunblane in December 2023 after he was targeted by scammers posing as a young girl. He was tricked into sending intimate images of himself and told they would be exposed to his family if he did not pay.Lawyers for his parents are now claiming Meta \"knew of safety features that would prevent sextortion\" prior to his death and instead \"prioritised profit\".Previously the company has said it had made real changes to Instagram, such as introducing teen accounts with built-in protections and giving parents the power to control their children's online experiences.Ros Dowey said they are launching legal action to get justice for Murray and \"all the other boys\" who have taken their own lives after being sextorted on Instagram\".Speaking on BBC Breakfast she said: \"We just feel that it is time that Meta were held accountable for what they've done to a lot of young people.\"There's evidence now that Meta knew at least five years before Murray died that their products weren't safe, there were design decisions that they made that were causing predators to easily find young people and then to be able to extort them.\"A spokesperson for Meta said that since 2021, it had placed teenagers under 16 into private accounts when they sign up for Instagram, meaning they have to approve new followers.They said: \"We work to prevent accounts showing suspicious behaviour from following teens and avoid recommending teens to them. \"We also take other precautionary steps, like blurring potentially sensitive images sent in DMs and reminding teens of the risks of sharing them, and letting people know when they're chatting to someone who may be in a different country.\"Murray's parents, Mark and Ros Dowey, are taking the legal actionBut Ms Dowey said Meta's protections for teens do not go far enough as only new users' accounts are made private if they are under 16, meaning Murray's account was not affected by the change.She said algorithms built in Meta sites were \"letting adults connect to children, and they were pushing those children to them\" and that safety advisors working within the company were \"pleading\" for change.She added: \"You always suspected that the likes of Meta were profits over everything, but to see it written down and to see that they probably could've saved your son it like a punch in the gut. It makes me so upset and angry.\"She wants Meta to acknowledge her son, and many others were \"collateral damage to greed\" and for better safety features to be installed immediately.'Yahoo boys'The lawsuit, filed by the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) on behalf of Mark and Ros Dowey, is believed to be the first UK case of its kind.Murray's parents are named alongside a woman, Tricia Maciejewski, from Pennsylvania. Her son, Levi Maciejewski, took his own life at 13 years old.The SMVLC is also representing four families in the UK who are suing TikTok, as they believe their children died from taking part in viral trends on the video-sharing platform.Sextortion has become big business in Nigeria involving thousands of young men nicknamed \"yahoo boys\".Guides on how to get involved in the crime are openly for sale online, as a BBC News investigation revealed last year.A report from the Network Contagion Research Institute, an American advocacy organisation, on the toll of yahoo boys is cited in court documents filed by lawyers representing the two families.The report calls the problem a \"digital pandemic\".If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, you can get help and support at BBC Action Line.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "12 hours agoHannah KarpelGetty ImagesIt might be a neighbour's car blocking your driveway, music vibrating through the walls, or a flashing inflatable Santa lighting up your bedroom at 3am.Or you may be the problem, unaware that your twinkling festive display is keeping your neighbours awake at night.Whatever the issue, you're unlikely to be alone. Tensions often rise during the festive season and, while raising concerns can feel awkward, there are practical and legal ways to deal with disputes.Here's how to deal with festive fallouts and keep the peace this Christmas.Use a light timerThere's no law that specifies when Christmas lights must be turned off. However, artificial light can be classed as a statutory nuisance if it \"interferes with the use or enjoyment of a home\" or is likely to \"injure health\".\"Speaking to neighbours in advance or using a timer to switch lights off at unsociable hours can help avoid problems,\" lawyer Denise Nurse told the BBC's Morning Live. Some lights are more disruptive than others. Sleep specialist Dr Nerina Ramlakhan says bright, flashing or blue-toned lights are particularly problematic. \"These wavelengths trigger photoreceptors in the eyes that suppress melatonin and shift our sleep-wake cycles,\" she says.If you're affected, she recommends starting with a polite conversation. \"They may not realise their lights are causing disruption and would be happy to make adjustments once they know,\" she says.If that fails, you can complain to your local council, who are obliged to investigate. If the council agrees the lights amount to a statutory nuisance, it can issue an abatement notice which if ignored could result in a fine.Warn them there will be noiseEven if you're only planning a one-off celebration, Nurse advises letting neighbours know in advance that they can expect some extra noise.Jon from east London, who enjoys hosting parties with his wife Sharon, says he always does this.\"It's  polite to let them know and apologise in advance if it disturbs them. We'll normally turn the music down by 11 or midnight - or sometimes just invite them to join us.\"If you're affected by noise, Nurse recommends asking them to turn it down in the first instance. If that doesn't work you can contact your local council under the Environmental Protection Act to report excessive noise.Parking can also be a point of contention over the festive period.Doug, who lives in Windsor says neighbours and their visitors often block his driveway or access path. \"It really winds me up,\" he says, explaining how his family have to walk across the garden or struggle to get out.\"I don't approach my neighbours because I always hope they'll realise how inconsiderate it is,\" he adds. \"But it keeps happening.\"\"Public roads are public roads, but parking on your driveway is trespassing,\" Nurse says, suggesting putting up signs to help deter the behaviour.If the problem continues, she suggests contacting your local council.Dumping your Christmas tree is fly-tippingGetty ImagesLobbing a Christmas tree into a park or over a fence might feel tempting once the festivities are over, but it counts as fly-tipping which is illegal and can result in fines, says Nurse.Not all councils offer a scheme for recycling your Christmas tree but most in the UK do through drop off points or collections. You can find your local scheme using websites like Recycle now, by entering your post code and finding your local drop-off or collection point or by checking your local council's website.Alternatively, some charities offer collection for a donation or local garden centres may chip up your old trees for mulch.It's not just trees that cause problems. Nurse says that households generate around a third more waste during the festive period which can often means bins spill over. \"Talk to your neighbours, and ask them to move anything that's causing an issue,\" she advises.If you still can't resolve itIf you've tried talking and things still aren't improving or last beyond the festive period, Nurse recommends seeking help from Citizens Advice.Each nation has a  service that connects neighbours with trained, neutral mediators who help both sides reach a resolution.Your local council may also be able to help you find a mediator, even if you're not a council tenant.Citizens Advice advises keeping a detailed record of incidents, noting what happened, how long it lasted and how it affected you. When you report it let them know what steps you've taken to try and resolve it. Ask when you can expect a response and what to do if the problem gets worse.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "Police turned me from victim to offender after I reported school assault6 hours agoAmy JohnstonWest Midlands Investigations TeamBBCTheo Rose was \"misled\" into accepting a sanction by West Midlands Police, a review has foundThe son of a former police officer was \"misled\" by a force into accepting a community resolution for violence he did not admit to, an investigation has found.Theo Rose reported being a victim of an assault at school to West Midlands Police (WMP) but was himself given a sanction over the incident instead.A report by the Office of the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) expressed \"concern\" the teenager might have agreed to accept it under \"false pretences\" - even if they were unintended - and was \"misinformed\" about the potential consequences.The force rescinded the community resolution in February and apologised to Theo the following month, in a letter seen by the BBC.Theo, with the help of his then police officer father, Rod Rose, lodged a complaint against the forceTheo made the initial report to Halesowen police station in December 2023 claiming that he had been twice attacked by a fellow student at his sixth form college. The then-18-year-old said he had been advised to do so on the advice of a lecturer, who had seen the attack, and told officers he had been kicked and punched.Police asked him to return to the station the following February and the OPCC found in an interview that day, Theo was \"misled\" into accepting a community resolution for affray - the use or threatening of unlawful violence towards another person.Theo said it was only afterwards, when he spoke to his parents, that he realised he had potentially been unfairly treated and the sanction could affect his job prospects.\"I was quite fearful for my future,\" said Theo, from Halesowen.'I still didn't understand'His father Rod Rose, a serving detective chief inspector with the force at the time, helped Theo lodge a complaint with its professional standards department.That investigation found officers told the teenager there was \"overwhelming and contradictory evidence\" against him.A further review of the complaint by the OPCC included bodycam footage which showed Theo telling police: \"I didn't use or threaten violence towards [the other teenager]\".It also found the \"most relevant\" witness statement backed up Theo's account.Theo, now 19, told the BBC he didn't know what affray was and had asked the handling officer.\"He explained it to me and I still didn't really understand,\" he said.According to the professional standards department, officers later reclassified the affray as two assaults - one with Theo as a victim and one as an offender - which he did not know and had not admitted to.The OPCC raised the question as to whether Theo would therefore have been entitled to use \"reasonable force\" to defend himself.Its report said: \"Although it appears unintended, [we] remain concerned that the document may have been signed under false pretences... It appears that Mr Rose had agreed to a resolution for one crime but it turned out to be another.\"Former Det Con Insp Rod Rose worked at Halesowen station, where his son made his initial reportCommunity resolution orders allow police to deal with low-level offences without going through the courts. They're usually aimed at first-time offenders but guidelines state there must be a clear admission of guilt and they must have the victim's agreement.They do not show up on a criminal record but do appear on enhanced Disclosure and Barring service (DBS) checks, which are required by certain jobs and can therefore affect a person's future career options.According to the OPCC report, officers \"misinformed\" Theo about the consequences of accepting the sanction.He told the BBC he asked for assurance several times and only accepted it because he feared being taken to court.\"That was the only reason why I was more than happy to accept a community resolution,\" Theo said.'What have you admitted to?'Mr Rose, who is now retired, was working at Halesowen station at the time and had previously worked in the out-of-court disposals department that dealt with community resolutions.He realised officers had not followed procedure during the handling of Theo's case.\"My first words were, what have you admitted to Theo? And he said, 'uh, I don't know',\" said Mr Rose.\"I was angry because it seemed like they [had] interviewed [Theo] without letting him know they [were] interviewing him and not giving him an opportunity to seek advice.\"Following the investigation and OPCC review, which made recommendations, WMP rescinded the community resolution, accepting that \"it would appear on review you [Theo] did not take responsibility for the offence of affray or assault\".Theo said \"no justice has been served\" as his original complaint as a victim of assault had not been resolved.\"My trust in the police has just been diminished,\" said Mr Rose.Rod RoseMr Rose received a commendation for courage and bravery in 2002 Mr Rose said he was \"disheartened\" by Theo's experience and said it was the first time in his 30-year career he had \"seen this side of policing\".\"It's going to take a lot for Theo to have any sort of trust and confidence back in the police. And if he doesn't, he's going to tell his children, don't trust the police because of my experiences.\"Two days before his retirement last year, Mr Rose was served gross misconduct papers by the force, the timing of which he described as \"malicious\".It was alleged he abused his role over Theo's sanction but the force's professional standards department found there was no case to answer in January.\"I was just a parent supporting and defending my son,\" he said.'Decisions can be reviewed'When asked by the BBC, the force did not comment on Mr Rose's claims about the timing of the misconduct allegations.A police spokesperson added: \"Community resolutions enable officers to make decisions about how to deal proportionately with lower-level crime but interventions agreed within them are voluntary and not legally enforceable.\"As it is an informal disposal which does not create a formal criminal record, we would not confirm the details of any person issued with a community resolution.\"As with all disposal types, it is occasionally appropriate that decisions can be reviewed, and where necessary rescinded.\"WMP issued 8,280 community resolutions in 2024, accounting for 77% of total out of court disposals - a 163% increase from 2019, when they accounted for only 47%.National statistics from the Ministry of Justice for that year showed 164,000 community resolutions were issued, also accounting for 77% of total out of court disposals - a 56% increase on five years ago.In a Freedom of Information request, the BBC asked WMP and other Midlands forces how many complaints they had received regarding community resolutions and how many had been rescinded.They said neither datasets were held in a retrievable way.The National Police Chiefs' Council said out-of-court resolutions were a \"highly effective\" way of delivering justice.Its deputy assistant commissioner, Dr Alison Heydari, added: \"We regularly review the use of community resolutions and over the next few months will be updating our guidance to reflect several recent and forthcoming significant reports.\"WMP was placed in special measures by His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services in November 2023 for four points, including \"failure to carry out effective investigations leading to satisfactory results for victims\".It came out of special measures in September.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLucy CarlinBBC News NIBBCJayla Boyd worked part time in JD while studying for her A-LevelsA student who worked as a sales assistant has settled a sexual harassment case against her former employer JD Sports for £65,000. Jayla Boyd worked part time in a Belfast store while studying for her A-levels. During a shift, Ms Boyd, who was 17 at the time, was slapped on the bottom by a male supervisor and was upset that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident.In settling the case, JD Sports Fashion PLC acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset to Ms Boyd. It also agreed to liaise with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI), who supported the case, to review its policies.Muscle memoryA JD Sports Fashion plc spokesperson said the individual involved is no longer employed by the company.In a statement the company said: \"This incident occurred in July 2024 and was promptly addressed in line with our policies.\"They also apologised to Ms Boyd.Following the incident, on the same day, Ms Boyd made a report to her manager and was told that CCTV had captured the incident. However, the supervisor was allowed to continue to work alongside her for the rest of the shift. She said he approached her twice during that time to talk to her and apologised for what he had done, explaining that it was \"muscle memory\".Despite raising a complaint of sexual harassment, Ms Boyd claimed that while she made a written statement, she was not formally interviewed about her experience. She said she felt upset and distressed that her employer failed to offer her support after the incident, so she used some annual leave to take time away from her job.Upon her return, she said no return-to-work meeting was arranged. ReutersJD Sports Fashion PLC has agreed to liaise with the Equality Commission to review its policies, practices and proceduresMs Boyd said she was not updated about the investigation or outcome of her complaint. \"I didn't really ever hear much, I didn't want to ask because I thought it was standard procedure that I was kept out of an investigation... I learned that wasn't really standard procedure and I should have been involved,\" Ms Boyd told BBC News NI. She also believes that her personal information relating to the incident was seen by other staff on a manager's computer.Ms Boyd experienced further embarrassment during a staff training session when an example involving a woman being slapped on the bottom by a supervisor was discussed. She felt certain the example referred to her own experience. Ms Boyd later resigned from her job.'I never expected this to happen to me'\"I never expected this to happen to me. The initial incident was embarrassing, but it was made worse because I felt like they were trying to ignore what had happened to me instead of dealing with it properly,\" Ms Boyd said.\"I had to remain working with this male supervisor after he had sexually harassed me. Everyone deserves to feel safe and supported at work. \"It took me a long time to understand that it was really serious and I think that came from the stigma around it, I was so worried about what other people thought... because of how people would see me... but now I am so glad I said something,\" she continued.\"I hope that by speaking out I can give others the confidence to challenge this type of behaviour.\"Zero-tolerance approachIn a statement, Chief Commissioner Geraldine McGahey said a \"zero-tolerance approach\" by employers to sexual harassment in the workplace \"will remind everyone how seriously it will be dealt with should any instances arise\". \"In order to prevent it, employers must ensure that all staff know what behaviour is acceptable, and unacceptable, in the workplace,\" she added.\"Employers must have clear policies and procedures in place to deal with harassment, and managers must be trained to use them appropriately. This type of behaviour must be investigated thoroughly, with the complaint dealt with sensitively and in a timely manner.\"In settling the case, ECNI said JD Sports Fashion PLC \"acknowledged and apologised for the significant upset, distress, and injury to feelings experienced by Ms Boyd\". It added: \"We work hard to create an environment where all colleagues are treated with dignity and respect in the workplace and whilst we have already made some changes to our processes, we welcome the opportunity to liaise with the Equality Commission to further review our policies, practices and procedures.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoMoose Campbell/BBCThe Flamingo missile is a new, long-range Ukrainian cruise missile, designed for deep strikes against Russia with a range of up to 3,000km Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent in KyivWe're driven blindfolded to a secret location where Ukraine is making one of its latest weapons. We're told to turn off our phones - such is the secrecy around the production of Ukraine's Flamingo cruise missile.For Ukraine, dispersing and hiding the production of weapons like this is key to survival. Two factories belonging to the company that makes it - Fire Point - have already been hit.Inside the one we're visiting we're told not to film any features such as pillars, windows or ceilings. We're also asked not to show the faces of workers on the assembly line - where Flamingo missiles are at various stages of completion.Even under fire, Ukraine is ramping up its arms industry. President Volodymyr Zelensky says the country now produces more than 50% of the weapons it uses on the front line. Almost its entire inventory of long-range weapons is domestically made.At the start of the war Ukraine mostly relied on its old Soviet-era arsenal. Western military support helped modernise the country's armed forces, but it now leads much of the world in developing unmanned systems – like robots and drones.Now, domestically produced cruise missiles are adding to Ukraine's long-range capability.Moose Campbell/BBCUkraine builds the missiles in secret factories - the BBC team were blindfolded before they were taken thereIryna Terekh is the chief technical officer of Fire Point – one of Ukraine's largest drone and missile manufacturers whose Latin motto translates to \"if not us, then who\".The 33-year-old once studied architecture, but she is now trying to help dismantle the Russian war machine.She cuts a tiny figure in front of the giant Flamingo missile, which she tells me is painted black not pink (unlike early prototypes) \"because it eats Russian oil\".The end product looks similar to the German V1 rocket from World War Two. It consists of a large jet engine placed on top of a tube the length of a London bus. They've already been used in combat, though the company won't confirm specific targets.Moose Campbell/BBCIrena Terekh from Fire Point says the Flamingo missile is black because it \"eats Russian oil\"The Flamingo is the kind of deep-strike weapon that Western nations have been reluctant to supply. The cruise missile is said to have a range of 3,000km (1,900 miles). That's similar to a US-made Tomahawk – the more sophisticated and expensive weapon that US President Donald Trump refused to give Ukraine.But deep strikes are seen as a critical part of the war, for which Ukraine mainly uses long-range drones. It is still losing ground to Russia on a front line that stretches for more than a thousand kilometres. So Ukraine is increasingly trying to target Russia's war economy, to slow those advances. The head of Ukraine's Armed Forces, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, says Ukraine's long-range strikes have already cost the Russian economy more than $21.5bn this year.Moose Campbell/BBCThe name Flamingo is a reference to early prototypes of the missiles, which were painted pinkRuslan, an officer in Ukraine's Special Operations Forces, says the strategy is simple: \"To reduce the enemy's military capabilities and their economic potential.\" He says Ukraine's Special Operations Forces have carried out hundreds of strikes on oil refineries, weapons factories and ammunition dumps - deep inside enemy territory. Of course Russia has been doing the same, and on a greater scale. On average it has been launching around 200 Shahed drones a day; Ukraine's response has been about half that number.Nor is Russia limiting its strikes to military targets. Its long-range missile and drone attacks have led to massive power cuts right across the country – making life harder for millions of civilians. \"I'd like to launch as many drones as Russia does,\" Ruslan says. \"But we're scaling up very quickly\".Ms Terekh, of Fire Point, says Ukraine may not be able to match Russia's resources, but, she says, \"we are trying to fight with brains and tactics\". Denys Shtilerman, the chief designer and co-founder of the company, admits there is no \"Wunderwaffe\" – or wonder weapon. \"The game changer is our will to win,\" he says.Kevin McGregor/BBCRuslan, in Ukraine Special Operations Forces, says they're quickly scaling up domestic weapons manufacturingFire Point didn't even exist before Russia's full-scale invasion. But the start-up is now producing 200 drones a day. Its FP1 and FP2 drones, each the size of a small aeroplane, have carried out 60% of Ukraine's long-range strikes. Each drone costs around $50,000 - a third of the price of a Russian Shahed drone. Russia is still producing nearly 3,000 of those a month.Ukraine still needs outside help, not least with intelligence, targeting and money. But it is trying to be more self-sufficient. Ms Terekh says they've made a deliberate decision to source as many of their components as possible from within Ukraine. \"We are following the principle that no one can influence the weapons we build,\" she says. They avoid parts from two specific countries – China and the United States. Asked why there should be no American components, she says \"we're on an emotional roller coaster [with the US]. Tomorrow somebody may want to shut it down, and we would not be able to use our own weapons.\"Matthew Goddard/BBCFire Point now produces 200 drones a dayUntil the end of last year, under President Biden, the United States supplied nearly $70bn-worth of military support to Ukraine. That was soon stopped under President Trump – instead he has set up a scheme to allow European Nato to purchase US weapons. The US is no longer Ukraine's biggest military backer, and Europe has struggled to fill the gap left by America or to match its previous support.Concerns about future US support spills over into talk of future US security guarantees – a key issue of the current peace talks. Ms Terekh dismisses the ongoing negotiations as \"capitulation talks\", and says that Ukraine making its own weapons \"is the only way to really provide security guarantees\".The former architecture student also hopes that the rest of Europe will be watching, and learning lessons. \"We are a bloody example,\" she says, \"in terms of being prepared for war.\"Ms Terekh says she wants to shock them into action, and believes that if any other country had faced the same onslaught as Ukraine \"then they'd already have been conquered.\"Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Kyla Herrmannsen.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorUkrinform/NurPhotoBelgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever is yet to be convinced that the money held in Belgium should be loaned to Ukraine (file pic)Volodymyr Zelensky is urging European Union leaders gathered at a crunch summit in Brussels to loan billions of euros in frozen Russian money to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs.Most of Russia's €210bn (£185bn; $245bn) worth of assets in the EU are held by Belgium-based organisation Euroclear, and so far Belgium and some other members of the bloc have said they are opposed to using the cash as a \"reparations loan\".Russia has warned the EU not to use its money, but without a boost in funding Ukraine's finances are set to run dry in a matter of months.\"I hope we will be able to get a positive decision,\" Zelensky told reporters. \"Without this there will be a big problem for Ukraine\". The Brussels summit comes at a pivotal moment in the war and Russia has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in a bid to get its money back.One European government official described being \"cautiously optimistic, not overly optimistic\" that a deal would be agreed. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said \"we will not leave the summit without a solution\".All eyes are on Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, who told the Belgian parliament on Thursday: \"I haven't yet seen any text that would persuade me to change Belgium's position\".US President Donald Trump has said a deal is closer than ever to end the war - which began with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. US and Russian officials are due to meet in Miami this weekend for further talks on a peace plan, a White House official told the AFP news agency. It is thought Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev will talk to Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Ukrainian officials are also heading to the US, and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is in Brussels, told reporters that Kyiv needed the money, either to support its army if the war continued, or to direct the funding entirely for recovery.Russia has not yet responded to the latest peace proposals, but the Kremlin has stressed that plans for a European-led multinational force for Ukraine supported by the US would not be acceptable.President Vladimir Putin made his feelings towards Europe clear on Wednesday, when he said the continent was in a state of \"total degradation\" and that \"European piglets\" - a derogatory description of Ukraine's European allies - were hoping to profit from Russia's collapse.Alexander KAZAKOV/POOL/AFPThose in favour of loaning Ukraine the money believe it will help deter Putin from continuing the warThe European Commission - the EU's executive arm - has proposed loaning Kyiv about €90bn (£79bn) over the next two years - out of the €210bn of Russian assets sitting in Europe.That is about two-thirds of the €137bn that Kyiv is thought to need to get through 2026 and 2027.Until now the EU has handed Ukraine the interest generated by the cash but not the cash itself.\"This is a crunch time for Ukraine to keep fighting for the next year,\" a Finnish government official told the BBC. \"There are of course peace negotiations but this gives Ukraine leverage to say 'we're not desperate and we have the funds to continue fighting'.\"The head of the European Commission says it will also ramp up the cost of war for Russia.Russia's frozen assets are not the only option on the table for EU leaders. Another idea, backed by Belgium, is based on the EU borrowing the money on the international markets, using the EU budget as a guarantee.However, that would require a unanimous vote and Hungary's Viktor Orban has made it clear he will not allow any more EU money to help Ukraine.For Ukraine, the hours ahead are significant and EU leaders have been keen to stress the momentous nature of the loan decision.\"We know the urgency. It is acute. We all feel it. We all see it,\" Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament.EPAUrsula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that two choices were on the table for EU leadersGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has played a leading role in pushing for the Russian assets to be used, telling the Bundestag on the eve of the summit it was about sending a \"clear signal\" to Moscow that continuing the war was pointless.EU officials are confident they have a sound legal basis to use the frozen Russian assets, but so far the Belgian prime minister remains unconvinced. His defence minister Theo Francken warned ahead of the talks that it would be a big mistake to loan the Euroclear cash.Hungary is seen as the biggest opponent of the move and, ahead of the summit, Prime Minister Orban and his entourage even suggested that the frozen assets plan had been removed from the summit agenda. A European Commission official stressed that was not the case and it would be a matter for the 27 member states at the summit.Slovakia's Robert Fico has also opposed using the Russian assets, if it means the money being used to procure weapons rather than for reconstruction needs.When the pivotal vote does finally take place, it will require a majority of at least 15 member states making up 65% of Europe's population to go through. Whatever happens, European Council President António Costa has promised not to go over the heads of the Belgians.\"We're not going to vote against Belgium,\" he told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. \"We'll continue to work very intensively with the Belgian government because we don't want to approve something that might not be acceptable for Belgium.\"Belgium will also be aware that ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on a negative watch, partly because of \"low\" legal risks to its balance sheet from the European Commission's plans to use the Russian assets. Euroclear's chief executive has also warned against the plan.\"There are many hiccups and obstacles of course still on the way. We have to find a way to respond to Belgium's worries,\" the Finnish official added. \"We are on the same side as Belgium. We will find a solution together to make sure all the risks are checked as much as they can be checked.\"However, Belgium is not the only country to have doubts, and a majority is not guaranteed.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has told Italian MPs she will endorse the deal \"if the legal basis is solid\".\"If the legal basis for this initiative were not solid, we would be handing Russia its first real victory since the beginning of this conflict.\"Malta, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are also said to be unconvinced by the controversial proposals.If the deal is passed and the Russian assets are given to Ukraine, the worst-case scenario for Belgium would be one in which a court would order it to hand the money back to Russia. Some countries have said they would be prepared to provide billions of euros in financial guarantees, but Belgium will want to see the numbers add up.At any rate, Commission officials are confident that the only way for Russia to get it back would be by paying reparations to Ukraine - at which point Ukraine would hand its \"reparations loan\" back to the EU.",

    "body": "The tech firms embracing a 72-hour working week13 hours agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentBBCThe recruitment website is jazzy, awash with pictures of happy young workers, and festooned with upbeat mini-slogans such as \"insane speed\", \"infinite curiosity\" and \"customer obsession\".Read a bit lower, and there are promises of perks galore: competitive compensation, free meals, free gym membership, free health and dental care and so on. But then comes the catch.Each job ad contains a warning: \"Please don't join if you're not excited about… working ~70 hrs/week in person with some of the most ambitious people in NYC.\"The website belongs to Rilla, a New York-based tech business which sells AI-based systems that allow employers to monitor sales representatives when they are out and about, interacting with clients.The company has become something of a poster child for a fast-paced workplace culture known as 996, also sometimes referred to as hustle culture or grindcore.In simple terms, it puts a premium on long working hours, typically 9am to 9pm, six days a week (hence \"996\").For most of us, that would be gruelling. But according to Will Gao, head of growth at Rilla, its 120 employees simply don't see it that way.\"We look for people who are like Olympian athletes, with characteristics of, you know, obsession, infinite ambition.\"It's people who want to do incredible things and have a lot of fun while doing so,\" he says.Will GaoWill Gao says the company Rilla looks for people \"like Olympian athletes\"He insists that while the hours are generally long, there's no rigid structure. \"If I'm like, 'Holy cow, I have a super idea I'm working on', then I'll just keep working until 2 or 3am, then I'll just roll in the next day at noon or something\", he explains.This kind of approach has become extremely popular in the technology sector over the past few years, and for good reason. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) has been taking place at a breakneck pace, and companies around the world are now working flat-out to develop ways in which it can be exploited and monetised.Huge amounts of money are being ploughed into AI ventures, many of them start-ups. But for every ambitious company founder, the ever-present fear is that someone else will get there first. Speed is of the essence – and tech sector workers are under pressure to work harder, and longer, to get results quickly.'Slackers are not my brothers'The 996 culture first came to the fore in China a decade ago. It was embraced by tech companies and start-ups at a time when the country was increasingly focused on transforming itself from the world's workshop for cheap goods into a leader in advanced technologies.It had some powerful advocates. They included Jack Ma, the billionaire founder of the retail behemoth Alibaba.com.\"I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing\", he wrote in one blog post for employees.\"It's not just entrepreneurs; most successful or ambitious artists, scientists, athletes, officials, and politicians work 996 or more\", he said in another. \"It's not because they have extraordinary perseverance, but because they are deeply passionate about their chosen careers\", he added.Getty ImagesJack Ma, former chairman of the Alibaba Group, called the 996 trend a \"blessing\"Another enthusiast was Richard Liu, founder of the retail behemoth JD.com, who at one point railed against what he saw as the country's declining work ethic. \"Slackers are not my brothers!\", he wrote in a controversial email to staff in 2019.But such an attitude prompted a backlash, including a wave of online complaints that companies were ignoring labour laws and failing to pay overtime, while forcing employees to work excessive hours. By 2021 this chorus of disapproval had become too loud for the authorities to ignore – and prompted a legal crackdown.In China, 996 has not disappeared, but its advocates have generally been a lot quieter. A notable exception was Baidu's one-time head of public relations, Qu Jing, who posted a series of videos on social media in 2024, aggressively defending a hard-working culture. Her brusque dismissal of employees' wellbeing, with the comment \"I'm not your mother, I only care about results\" provoked outrage. She later apologised, but it ultimately cost Qu her job.Yet the culture still has fans elsewhere. Last year, Narayana Murthy, the founder of Indian software giant Infosys, spoke admiringly about China's use of 996. He remarked in a TV interview that \"no individual, no community, no country has ever come up without hard work\".So why has the US tech industry chosen to embrace the trend? A key factor appears to have been the headlong rush to develop ways of using AI.\"It's mainly AI companies,\" explains Adrian Kinnersley, who runs recruitment businesses in Europe and North America. \"It's those that have some funding from venture capitalists, that are in a race to develop their products and get them out to market before someone else beats them to it. That's led them into the idea that, if you work longer hours, you win the race.\"One of those AI start-ups is run by Magnus Müller, a young German-born entrepreneur. He co-founded Browser-Use, a business that is developing tools to help AI applications interact with web browsers. He lives in a \"hacker-house\", a shared living and workspace, where he and his colleagues continually swap ideas, and believes working long hours is just a fact of life.Magnus MüllerMagnus Müller lives in a \"hacker house\" - a shared home and workspace where he and his colleagues constantly exchange ideas\"I think it's hard, what we're trying to build. I think it's the problems we're trying to solve, giving AI these extra capabilities. It's super hard, and very competitive, and most often the returns come when you just immerse yourself very deeply into a problem… then suddenly fascinating things happen.\"Browser-Use currently has just seven staff, but it is recruiting more. Müller says he is looking for people with the same kind of mentality as himself. Anyone who wants to work a 40-hour week, he says, is unlikely to fit in.\"We really look for people who are just addicted, who love what they're doing\", he emphasises. \"It's like gaming, OK? It's like you're addicted to gaming… for us, it doesn't really feel like work. We just do what we love.\"Others disagree. Deedy Das is a partner at Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm which has a near 50-year record of investing in technology businesses. He thinks the most common mistake young entrepreneurs make is insisting their employees work 996-style hours.Deedy DasDeedy Das says working long hours does not mean staff are being productive or working efficiently\"I think the thing young founders get wrong is they view hours worked in and of itself as necessary and sufficient to think of themselves as productive. And that's where the fallacy lies\", he explains. \"Forcing your employees to come in, and hustle, is a downstream artefact of such a mindset.\"He thinks such an approach can alienate those with families, as well as experienced older workers who \"can actually work far less and achieve much more because they know what they're doing\". He adds that continual long hours will lead to long-term burnout.However, he concedes that for company founders themselves, with skin in the game and the potential to become very wealthy if their business succeeds, different rules apply.\"Frankly, I would be shocked if a founder wasn't working 70-80 hours per week. I can personally say… if I'm investing in an early-stage founder, if they're not working 70-80 hours a week, it's probably not a great investment.\"Academic and author on workplace culture, Tamara Myles, says hustle culture is unsustainable, especially if people feel compelled to be working at all times. But she concedes there are grey areas.More from InDepth\"The nuance here is that a lot of these tech companies that are living this 996 culture are actually not hiding it, they're advertising it. They're selling it as a badge of honour, almost,\" she says.But that doesn't mean everyone who agrees to work 996 actually wants to, she argues. \"You might be staying because the job market is tough right now, or you might be here for a visa, and you depend on it. So there might be power dynamics at play.\"Health risksYet those who do choose to burn the midnight oil could end up paying a heavy price.Concerns over the health impact of working long hours are certainly not new. In Japan, a country with a long-established hard-work culture, where so-called salarymen have notoriously supported the post-war economy with utter dedication to their employers, there is even a word for it: Karōshi.It means death through overwork, and refers principally to strokes and heart attacks suffered by people working very long hours. Karōjisatsu, meanwhile, refers to people taking or attempting to take their own lives due to workplace stress.Both are recognised in Japanese law, and families are in theory eligible for compensation from a government scheme, although in practice proving a death derives from overwork can be difficult.More broadly, analysis published in 2021 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) concluded that long working hours - defined as more than 55 hours per week - had led to 745,000 deaths worldwide from stroke and heart disease in 2016.It concluded that working 55 hours or more a week increased the risk of dying of heart disease by 17% compared to working 35-40 hours, and raised the risk of a stroke by 35%.The productivity thresholdThen, there's productivity - broadly speaking the amount that actually gets done for every hour worked. Studies have shown that as hours go up, productivity initially increases - but once a threshold is reached it starts to decline again as physical and mental exhaustion sets in. The 'sweet spot' is widely recognised to be around 40 hours per week.As one recent study put it: \"At around 40h per five-day work week, workers seem to be able to maintain productivity fairly well, but when individuals exceed this threshold and engage in longer work hours, their job performance gradually weakens because of increased fatigue and underprivileged health conditions.\"In other words, once this threshold is reached, the extra output from every hour worked starts to decline. Even so, there will always be a temptation for companies to employ fewer people and get them to work for longer. This is because each extra employee comes at a cost: they have to be recruited, trained if necessary, and paid.Getty ImagesOffice workers in the 1980s in Japan, where a culture of dedication to the employer has its own word, KarōshiBut research suggests this approach can backfire. According to Michigan State University, productivity can fall so sharply that \"an employee working 70 hours per week has almost no difference in output than an employee working 50 hours per week\".This isn't a new concept. A century ago, Henry Ford set an example that other major industrialists would follow, when he cut working hours for staff in his car factories and adopted a 40-hour, five-day week.100-hour weeksNevertheless, there are those who believe that British companies today could take a leaf out of the US tech sector's book.For example, the co-founder and former CEO of BrewDog, James Watt, posted a widely-shared video in which he said: \"I think the whole concept of work-life balance was invented by people who hate the work they do. So if you love what you do, you don't need work life balance, you need work-life integration.\"He subsequently pointed to a study by academics at King's College London that showed people in the UK are among the least likely to believe work should always come first. He said it showed the UK to be \"one of the world's least work-oriented countries\".In a BBC documentary in 2022, Watt himself was accused of inappropriate behaviour and abuse of power in the workplace. He apologised to anyone who felt uncomfortable because of his behaviour but hit out at \"false rumours and misinformation\". BrewDog's new chief executive James Taylor said last year the business is  \"well past\" its previous controversies.HBOHBO's TV drama Industry, written by two former investment bankers, highlights the tough work culture at some financial institutionsFor some in the UK, talk of 996 culture could feel rather familiar. Jobs at large corporate law firms here pay high salaries, but many demand long hours in return. According to a survey carried out last year by the website Legal Cheek, it is not uncommon for average working days to be 12 hours or more.Investment banking - the wheeling and dealing side of the financial industry, which looks after mergers, acquisitions and stock market launches - is also notorious for long hours. Industry sources suggest 65 to 70 hours a week are relatively common, and can extend up to 100 hours when a major deal is being finalised.'Working smarter'?Is it legal here? UK law, under the working time regulations, states that most employees should not have to work more than 48 hours a week on average. But people can choose to opt out and work longer if they choose. So provided the employee gives their consent, 996 is allowed.However Ben Wilmott, head of public policy at the human resources professionals' association CIPD, thinks it is wrong to believe that long hours lead to better performance.\"There doesn't seem to be any correlation at all between working long hours and productivity\", he says. \"There is quite good evidence which shows there's a risk of ill health if you work long hours… there's a higher risk of stroke and heart disease.\"So I think the focus should be on working smarter rather than longer… improving management capability, technology adoption, adoption of AI to improve productivity, rather than a focus on increasing working hours.\"Universal Images GroupSeeing exhausted 'salarymen' fast asleep on the Tokyo underground is not an uncommon sightSome campaigners believe the UK could actually benefit from a reduction in working hours, and the adoption of a four-day week.They point to the results of a pilot project carried out in 2022, in which 61 organisations agreed to cut working hours for all staff for six months without any reduction in pay.It concluded that this significantly reduced stress and illness in the workforce, and helped companies retain staff, without losing productivity.Recruitment expert Adrian Kinnersley believes the current enthusiasm for 996 remains largely confined to the technology sector, and for a good reason.\"Whether you need to work 80 hours a week is debatable, but I think you would struggle in the current environment to compete with a relaxed 35-hour week culture,\" he says.For Browser-Use founder Magnus Müller meanwhile, the hours he and his peers work in Silicon Valley are really nothing remarkable.\"I'm from a tiny village in south Germany\", he says. \"The farmers there, they get up at five every day and work more than 12 hours per day, seven days a week. And they don't take any holidays, or maybe just two to three days when they can get someone to take care of their cows.\"So I think there are so many industries where people have so much harder jobs, and struggle so much harder, and work so much harder. I would say it's more like kindergarten, what we are doing compared to them.\"Top image credit: Getty.BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, How big will next weekend's Scotland v England match prove to be?ByTom RostanceBBC Sport journalistFrance were sensational yet inconsistent, England outpowered Wales and it was very, very wet in Rome.Who impressed, and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?France 'on a different level'Media caption, France comfortably beat Ireland in Six Nations openerThursday night was an unconventional starting point for the tournament, and for the first 40 minutes hosts France seemed to be playing a different sport altogether in a 36-14 win against Ireland in Paris.The electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored twice but it was the way France attacked from every position - and their strength in depth - that really impressed the pundits.France were able to score seemingly at will, and all without all-time top try-scorer Damian Penaud - left out despite scoring 40 tries in 59 appearances for his country.\"The first-half performance from France was amazing - they blew Ireland away,\" Grand Slam winner Donncha O'Callaghan told 5 Live Sport.\"They are a level ahead of Ireland, maybe two levels. Ireland couldn't compete.\" To Ireland's credit they did threaten a comeback in the second half but France then went again to wrap up an emphatic win.Chris Ashton added on Rugby Union Weekly: \"It was magic. France can flip and flop to different styles seamlessly. There is so much you have to contend with playing against them - you don't know which fire to put out first.\"It's got to be a worry for everyone. France have so much depth - the sport is getting bigger and bigger in the country.\"Can France be stopped? They face Wales in Cardiff next Sunday.Media caption, What makes 'incredible' Bielle-Biarrey a generational talent?2026 Six NationsRound one reviewCatch up with Six Nations Rugby Special on BBC iPlayer and the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast on BBC Sounds'England straight in at full tilt'Media caption, England can't get carried away with big win over WalesIf anyone can match France for strength in depth it is England, who started their campaign by thrashing Wales 48-7.Wing Henry Arundell was handed a first start for two years and promptly helped himself to a first-half hat-trick, the first treble by an England men's player since Arundell himself scored five tries against Chile at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.Incredibly, it was the team's first Six Nations hat-trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.Ben Earl showed some of the fluency France would admire by moving from number eight to centre late on as England showed they are continuing to move in the right direction.\"England now realise where they can be,\" former scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly.\"Whether that's winning a Grand Slam or a World Cup, only they will know their internal targets.\"But you can see that winning a scrum is not enough, scoring a try, not enough, winning the game, not enough. They are setting their standards.\"Dawson's former team-mate Paul Grayson was impressed with England's speed out of the blocks at the start of a new cycle.He said: \"England were straight in at full tilt - they were ruthless and accurate. \"England are exciting to watch now. There are lots of moving pieces being done brilliantly well and that's why England are hard to play against now.\"Tougher challenges await - and England head to Murrayfield next weekend.Townsend's future dominates Scotland chatterMedia caption, Townsend out a necessity if Scotland don't finish top threeThat England visit comes at a crucial time for Scotland and their coach Gregor Townsend.He came into the tournament courted by Newcastle Red Bulls and with question marks over his commitment to the cause.A tame display in some horrendous weather in Rome as Italy picked up a famous 18-15 win has left some calling for a change.Former Scotland forward John Barclay told Rugby Special: \"I thought before the Six Nations that Scotland had to finish third or above.\"If they don't, which is now going to be very hard, I think it becomes a necessity to see a change.\"It's a good group of players and if you are not seeing an improvement there is an option for change. That might be the best thing for Gregor and for Scotland.\"The conditions made the going tough, but it was Scotland's heart, not hands, that were questioned.\"Italy were more aggressive and that's down to desire, not the rain,\" former Scotland and British and Irish Lions prop Peter Wright told BBC Scotland.\"Townsend is an experienced coach and should have known they couldn't play the rugby they wanted to play in those conditions. Scotland lost the war in the set-pieces.\"The defeat was a fifth away loss in a row in the Six Nations for Scotland and their beleaguered coach.Before the match, Townsend - who is contracted as head coach until the end of the 2027 World Cup - dismissed a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup as \"pure speculation\".More displays like this may make that contract end date a moot point. Scotland need to dig deep and find another level of performance against England.Expect recalls for Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham to provide energy and - Scotland will hope - ammunition.'Defence is a mindset' - can Wales reset?Media caption, Arundell scores first-half hat-trick against WalesIf that defeat left Scotland in crisis, where exactly are Wales?Thrashed at Twickenham, they have now won only two of their past 24 Tests and have not won a Six Nations match since 2023.Discipline is a major issue. Wales conceded 16 penalties against England - the most they have conceded in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.Barclay said Wales' issues are mental, not technical.They have shipped 248 points and conceded 34 tries in coach Steve Tandy's first five games in charge.\"It appears there is so much to try and fix in a week for Wales,\" Barclay said.\"First up has to be their tackling. Defence is easier to sort than attack - it's a mindset.\"The lack of intent in the tackle is something to look at. How do you fix ill-discipline? If you fix your defence and be a hard team to beat that will sort itself.\"Wales won a Grand Slam as recently as 2019 and a title in 2021, but are heading towards a third consecutive Wooden Spoon. Next up? Free-scoring France on Sunday.An all-time year for Italy?Media caption, 'What a start for Italy' - Lynagh scores first tryThe opening-day win for Italy was a 17th in the Six Nations - and ninth over Scotland.Their best campaigns to date have featured two wins, and matching or beating that may be on the agenda.Italy's only other home game this year is against England on 7 March, but the Azzurri will surely have their eyes on a trip to Wales a week later.\"It makes you feel very confident in what you can do,\" captain Michele Lamaro said. \"So now we've got a dream in our head. We keep going on.\"It's Ireland away on Saturday for Gonzalo Quesada's side.2026 Guinness Six Nations5 February-14 MarchWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day three: Monday, 9 FebruaryMedals: FiveMedal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)Newly crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, has reached the final for a second consecutive Games. The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli.Curling: Mixed doubles - semi-final (17:05-1900)Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds finished top of the round-robin stage with eight wins and one defeat and will face Sweden, who they lost to at this stage four years ago.Victory would guarantee GB a first mixed doubles medal, but defeat would mean they enter a bronze-medal match. Figure skating: Ice dance – rhythm dance (18:20-2200)Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. The omens are good for the British pair – last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez.Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick – and an Olympic medal – in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix.Good to knowThe curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 – Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today.Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question – their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria.Day four: Tuesday, 10 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10)The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud – who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhoodAlpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here.Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20)The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  – Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy.Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10)The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings.Good to knowMost athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) – another Olympic medal would be her 12th.Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion.The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) – and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles.

Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow.Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40)  The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round.Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00)Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44.Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05)Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December.Figure skating: Ice dance – free dance (18:30-22:05)Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing.Good to knowUSA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30.

Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany.Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games.Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's \"good to go\" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January.Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50)It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance.Good to knowWomen's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05.

Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion?

The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019.

A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France.

The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit.

Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

    "body": "13 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterGetty ImagesSenior university leaders previously attended a briefing with MI5 to discuss what interference might look like on campusesUniversity bosses have been told by ministers to report threats of foreign interference directly to the government and security services.Skills Minister Jacqui Smith said UK universities had become \"a prime target for foreign states and hostile actors\".She said the government did \"not take this lightly\" and would spend £3m on measures including a new secure platform for vice-chancellors and designated security leaders at universities to report suspicious approaches or interference.It comes after senior leaders at 70 universities attended a briefing with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum to discuss what interference might look like, such as censoring research and intimidating staff.The UK-China Transparency (UKCT) think tank said its survey of China studies academics had found reports of Chinese government officials warning lecturers to avoid discussing certain topics in their classes.Some academics also reported intimidation by visiting scholars or other Chinese officials, as well as by staff at Confucius Institutes.These institutes are partnership organisations linking Chinese and UK universities with a Chinese government agency which provides funding.They promote Chinese culture and language on UK campuses, but have been criticised over alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.The Chinese embassy in London at the time called the UKCT report's findings \"groundless and absurd\", adding that China respects freedom of speech in the UK and elsewhere.Laura Murphy, a professor of human rights and contemporary slavery, said at the time that the university had \"negotiated directly with a foreign intelligence service to trade my academic freedom for access to the Chinese student market\".Sheffield Hallam apologised to Murphy. The Chinese embassy criticised some of the university's work on Xinjiang as being \"seriously flawed\".Following the UK government's latest intervention urging universities to report any foreign interference, higher education regulator the Office for Students said it would work with the sector to address \"significant and growing threats\".Arif Ahmed, the regulator's director for freedom of speech, said: \"We've always been clear that universities must resist external state threats to academic freedom, and that suppression of research because of the disapproval of a foreign government is unacceptable in practically any circumstances.\"Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, welcomed the idea of a single point of contact for reports, saying this would \"empower institutions to report and take action more swiftly and confidently, knowing there is support in place\".",

    "body": "7 minutes agoHafsa KhalilPA MediaMonday morning brought flooding to roads in Leicestershire, with more heavy rain forecast in other parts of the country More than 100 flood warnings are in place as more heavy downpours are set to drench parts of the country on Monday.The Environment Agency has issued more than 105 flood warnings and 181 flood alerts across England as of midday, with saturated ground and already-swollen rivers making flooding more likely.Heavy rain in south-west England and south Wales has also prompted a Met Office yellow warning, which will remain in place until the end of the day.The Met Office added: \"10-15mm (0.6in) of rain is likely fairly widely with 20-30mm in some places exposed to the strong south to south-easterly winds.\"Further Met Office rain warnings have also been issued for Tuesday and Wednesday in parts of eastern Scotland.A flood warning means flooding is expected, and an alert means flooding is possible.\"There will be some heavy rain and the rain is falling on saturated ground so further flooding is possible, particularly as we move into the evening,\" Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said on Monday.He added there was potential for \"surface water on the roads\" on Monday, which could cause disruption to travel.The Met Office previously confirmed that rain fell every day of 2026 in south-west England and south Wales, with both areas seeing 50% more rainfall than usual.The Environment Agency estimated at least 300 properties had been reported as flooded on Sunday, with about 16,200 more now having been protected.\"We urge people not to drive through flood-water - it is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car,\" Sarah Cook, the agency's flood duty manager cautioned.S Pace/BBC Weather WatchersWindsor and Maidenhead also experienced flooding on SundayMonday to Wednesday will be cloudy with intermittent rain for most areas. The heaviest downpours once again will be focused around south-west England and south Wales where rain will fall on very saturated ground.From midweek onwards, a trend to colder and drier conditions is expected.Snow showers are likely over hills and mountains in Scotland and perhaps northern England for a time but most parts of the UK should see a return to drier weather and sunshine throughout Thursday and into Friday.Flood warnings are clustered in Devon and Hampshire, as well as between Gloucester and Worcester. However, more than 180 flood alerts are scattered across much of England apart from the far north and East Anglia.Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service warned that flooding was \"imminent\" after \"heavy prolonged rainfall\" had caused local levels at the River Dene to rise.PA MediaHeavy rainfall has led to flooding, causing disruption to road travel in HampshireFloods Minister Emma Hardy said her thoughts were with those affected as she urged residents to follow local advice over the coming days.Northern Ireland has had its wettest January in 149 years, while County Down and Cornwall had the wettest January on record, according to the Met Office.February has also seen similarly intense rainfall.Provisional Met Office data shows some parts of the UK recorded more rainfall in the first five days of the month than it would normally expect over the course of the whole month.Aberdeenshire has been one of the wettest places of all, with Aboyne receiving more than 130% of its normal February rainfall in just five days.Last month, Storm Chandra brought flooding and travel disruption, and saw dozens of schools close.It was the third named storm to batter the UK so far this year, after Ingrid and Goretti.",

    "body": "4 hours agoPA MediaAlbert Lamond was a teenager when he took part in the 1944 D-Day landingsOne of Scotland's last surviving D-Day veterans has died aged 100.Albert Lamond, from Glasgow, was an 18-year-old signalman aboard HMS Rowley when he took part in the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944.He also served in the lead up to VJ day the following year, helping to evacuate prisoners of war (PoWs) from remote islands in the Pacific and transport them to Australia.Lamond's family said he \"never thought of himself as a hero\" and believed he was \"just doing his duty\".His nephew, Martin, said: \"Not only have Albert's friends and family suffered a great loss, everyone has, even if they never had the pleasure of knowing him.\"Albert carried the memory of those who didn't make it with him throughout his life.\"We are incredibly proud of him and grateful for the time we had.\"Lamond was born in Glasgow's east end and joined the Royal Navy in 1943.He was deployed to the coast of northern France a year later aboard HMS Rowley.The frigate's role was to act as a first line of defence by circling battleship HMS Warspite and it was expected that the sailors would sacrifice their lives.PA MediaAlbert joined the Royal Navy in 1943 - aged just 18He said: \"It was horrible. It lives with you forever.\"If we don't pass the stories on, people will forget, and we can't let that happen.\"In 1945, he served in the Pacific in the lead up to Japan's surrender.He described the rescued PoWs as \"like living skeletons,\" but said they were still able to smile.A short time later, Lamond was part of an American fleet sailing to invade Japan when victory was declared.\"It was the end. It was a relief it was over and it was finished. It was good to get home.\"After the war, Lamond worked on the railways and later lived at the McKellar House in Renfrewshire, run by the Erskine veterans' charity.The organisation's chief executive, wing commander Ian Cumming, said he would never forget Lamond's \"cheeky patter\".He said: \"Albert represented the very best of his generation.\"He spoke honestly about his service, not to glorify war, but to make sure people understood its cost.\"We won't forget the ever-present twinkle in Albert's eye. \"We were truly privileged to care for and support him in later life.\"",

    "body": "Twenty years is 'a death sentence', son of British media tycoon jailed by China says37 minutes agoJohanna ChisholmBBC NewsGetty ImagesA Hong Kong court jailed pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai for 20 years after he was found guilty of national security offences last DecemberThe son of Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai has called his imprisonment by Chinese authorities essentially a \"death sentence\".The 78-year-old British citizen was sentenced on Monday for 20 years after he was found guilty of national security offences last December, marking the harshest sentence to be given under the city's controversial national security law (NSL).Sebastien Lai, his son, told the BBC that he believes his father is being punished for \"defending the freedom of Hong Kong\".As a British citizen, Sebastian told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that Lai deserves much more.\"Surely a man who has given so much for liberty, for freedom deserves a bit of it himself,\" Sebastien said.Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK government intends to \"rapidly engage further\" with Beijing on Lai's release. \"I again call on the Hong Kong authorities to end this appalling ordeal and release him on humanitarian grounds, so that he may be reunited with his family,\" Cooper said in a statement.She added: \"We stand with the people of Hong Kong.\"Hailed as a hero by the pro-democracy movement, Lai was also seen as a traitor by Beijing.Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for his release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.China introduced the controversial national security law in 2020 in response to pro-democracy protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before.The legislation makes illegal a wider range of dissenting acts, including anything the state regards as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. It also allows Hong Kong to send cases to be tried in mainland China.Getty ImagesSebastien Lai, the son of pro-democracy tycoon Jimmy Lai, says the prison term is a death sentenceLai was found guilty of foreign collusion and publishing seditious material under the NSL. A court found that he used his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper as part of a wider effort to lobby foreign governments to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.For the last five years, he has been held in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison - a detention his son believes is causing his health to \"tremendously suffer\".\"Given his health, given that he has heart issues, given that he's lost 10kg over the last year alone, that's basically a death sentence,\" his son said.On a trip to Beijing last month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters that he had raised the issue of Lai's release with Chinese authorities. \"Part of the rationale for engagement is to make sure that we can both seize the opportunities that are available - which is what we've done - but also have a mature discussion about issues that we disagree on,\" Sir Keir said after his meeting with President Xi Jinping.Former UK prime minister David Cameron joined the government in calling for Lai's release, saying the activist's imprisonment was \"an affront to freedom of speech\".\"China must know that the world is watching,\" he wrote in a social media post.The trip also saw an agreement to cut import taxes on UK whisky from 10% to 5%, as the government seeks closer trade ties with Beijing to help boost economic growth.Asked about how he viewed the UK government's recent diplomatic efforts to normalise relations with China, Sebastien pointed out that his father's case could present an \"easy\" opportunity to build even stronger ties.\"If we talk about warming a relationship, well, I think for most people listening to this, isn't putting a 78-year-old man on a plane and sending him back here a very easy way for Hong Kong and China to do that?\", he told the BBC.China maintains that its actions in the Lai case were \"reasonable, legitimate and legal\", with its foreign ministry saying on Monday there is \"no room for argument\".

    "body": "41 minutes agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterBBCDean Mero has run Barry M since the death of his father, Barry Mero, in 2014Barry M, the affordable make-up brand, has been bought out of administration by Warpaint, which produces cosmetics for men.The family-run firm, which was set up in north London in 1982 by Barry Mero, collapsed earlier this month.Warpaint said on Monday it has acquired the Barry M name for £1.4m.The deal does not protect more than 100 staff who worked at Barry M or its factory in the capital where it produces its nail varnish and make-up lines.Barry M had been a favourite of make-up fans and drag queens for its eye-catching colours.It is stocked in around 1,300 shops across the UK, including Superdrug, Boots, Sainsbury's and Tesco.Patrick O'Brien, retail research director at analytics firm GlobalData, said Barry M had failed to innovate and had instead been \"more reactive\".He told the BBC that the company had also struggled as, despite being stocked in well-known retailers, it faced increasing competition from rival brands at affordable price points.O'Brien said Barry M had become \"a small brand in a sea of new and fun names, which are generating traction through social media marketing\".Since Mero's death in 2014, the compamy has been run by his son, Dean Mero. His father reasoned that these people were looking for \"the blacks and the blues and the greens and the yellows\", but why not offer more than that? He remembers his father saying that no other make-up company had produced 100 colours and Barry M would become the first firm to reach that target.Getty ImagesBarry Mero was inspired by the \"new romantics\" of the early 1980s  In the year to 28 February, 2025 the most recent for which figures are available, Barry M reported sales of £15m.Alongside the deal, Warpaint also provided a trading update in which it said full-year profits would be lower due to a \"challenging consumer and customer environment\" as well as US tariffs. It said the levies, announced by US President Donald Trump, resulted in a £2m hit to its business as \"uncertainty earlier in the year\" led to \"stalled momentum in the US\".While sales for 2025 are expected to be higher at £105m, compared to £102m in the previous year, underlying profit is forecast to fall from £25m to £22m.  Warpaint said taking over Barry M would increase its sales by expanding its reach in stores.Warpaint's takeover of Barry M is subject to court approval. Warpaint's share price climbed by 8.5% after the announcement.",

    "body": "21 hours agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterShutterstockMorgan McSweeney has long been considered instrumental to the rise of Sir Keir Starmer - it remains to be seen whether his resignation as chief of staff helps keep his former boss in position.The prime minister's right-hand man leaves government after several Labour MPs and peers called for someone to be held accountable for the decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to the United States.While Lord Mandelson was sacked from the role last September, pressure mounted on Downing Street when newly-released files raised further questions about the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Questions focused on how much the prime minister knew at the time of Lord Mandelson's appointment as well as the vetting process.Sir Keir apologised last week, using a press conference to state that \"none of us knew the depths and the darkness\" of the relationship between Lord Mandelson and Epstein.On Sunday, McSweeney claimed \"full responsibility\" for advising the prime minister to make that appointment.Announcing his resignation as chief of staff, he said: \"The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong.\"Sir Keir said it had been \"an honour\" working with McSweeney for many years and credited him with having \"turned our party around after one of its worst ever defeats and played a central role running our election campaign\".McSweeney derived his power and influence from his track record as a political strategist - he masterminded Labour's landslide 2024 general election victory and Sir Keir's 2020 Labour leadership bid.Like previous powerful but unelected advisers in Downing Street, such as Dominic Cummings or Alastair Campbell, he has been the target of negative stories.His closeness to Sir Keir - as a seasoned political operator to a relatively inexperienced prime minister - meant he was seen as \"proxy\" for the PM.McSweeney emerged victorious from an internal power struggle to become Sir Keir's chief of staff in 2024 after the dramatic resignation of Sue Gray.ReutersMorgan McSweeney arriving for the annual Lady Mayor's Banquet at the Guildhall in London, in December 2025Quiet, unassuming, even shy, particularly in public, McSweeney was known for being obsessed by winning, constantly fearful of complacency and ever aware of Labour's track record of losing far more elections than it wins.Born in Macroom, County Cork, he had a comfortable upbringing as the son of an accountant and a retired office worker, according to a profile by The Times newspaper's Patrick Maguire and Gabriel Pogrund.He moved to London as a teenager, initially working on building sites before winning a place at the London School of Economics.According to the book Get In, authored by Maguire and Pogrund, he dropped out and went to live in an Israeli kibbutz for six months, before returning to London to study at Middlesex University - leaving with a degree in politics and marketing.McSweeney then joined Labour under Tony Blair, working in a junior role at the party's headquarters.He later started working for Steve Reed, who is now housing secretary, but at the time was a councillor in Lambeth, south London, where he was trying to regain control of the party from the hard left.In 2006, McSweeney helped run the party's successful campaign to take control of the council, with Reed becoming leader.His reputation as a skilled campaign strategist was further cemented in Barking and Dagenham, where the far-right, anti-immigrant British National Party was gaining support and hoping to win its first parliamentary seat 2010.McSweeney played a key role in the fight to defeat the BNP in the area, with a campaign which focused on local issues.However, his campaigns were not always a success - in 2015 he ran Blairite Liz Kendall's bid to become Labour leader, where she secured only 4.5% of votes in the contest won by Jeremy Corbyn.In 2017, McSweeney became a director of the think tank Labour Together, which opposed the direction of the party under Corbyn and went on to back Sir Keir.The Electoral Commission later fined Labour Together £14,250 for late and inaccurate reporting of donations during the period when McSweeney was a director.The fine later fuelled calls from Conservative MPs for a deeper investigation into Labour's campaign finances - though the Electoral Commission decided not to reopen an investigation.At the time of the fine, McSweeney had left Labour Together to run Sir Keir's 2020 leadership bid, later becoming his chief of staff in opposition, where he played a key role in removing Corbyn supporters from positions of power.The Times reported it was here that he masterminded what became Starmer's three-year plan: detoxifying the party, becoming an effective opposition then outflanking the Conservatives on crime, defence and the economy in order to win power.As Labour's campaign director, McSweeney was tasked with devising the party's strategy for the 2024 general election, including Labour's selection process for parliamentary candidates, which saw left-wing figures sidelined and caused fierce rows with the trade union movement.Among the new Labour MPs to be elected was his wife, Imogen Walker, a former councillor in Lambeth who now represents Hamilton and Clyde Valley.McSweeney was credited with keeping Labour HQ focussed on winning back so called \"hero voters\", the Leave-backing constituents who supported Boris Johnson in 2019 but were willing to swing back behind Labour.He also oversaw the deployment of money and teams into marginal constituencies, often to the detriment of senior Labour figures in safe seats.The result was a historic landslide, with Labour gaining over 200 seats despite increasing their vote share by less than two percentage points.",

    "body": "45 minutes agoSean SeddonandDaniela Relph,Royal correspondentReutersThe Prince and Princess of Wales have said they are \"deeply concerned\" by the latest revelations about Jeffrey Epstein in their first public statement on the scandal.A Kensington Palace spokesperson said Prince William and Princess Catherine were \"focused on the victims\" in light of new information contained in documents related to the late sex offender released in the US.The statement was released after more allegations against Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor emerged, increasing the scrutiny on the former prince.A royal spokesperson said: \"I can confirm The Prince and Princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations. \"Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.\"Although the two-line statement from the Prince and Princess of Wales made no direct reference to Epstein, Andrew or his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also faced further questions in light of the latest document release, it remains significant, if not explicit. It was published as Prince William prepared to begin an official visit to Saudi Arabia, a trip which has been viewed as highly significant diplomatically. He and royal aides are well aware that as headlines around Epstein continue to swirl, so does the scrutiny on the Royal Family's response.Fallout continues after Mandelson resigns over Epstein links - follow liveIn releasing the statement, William will hope that it shows he is concerned and not oblivious to the damaging headlines, as well as clearing the way for focus on his official trip to Saudi Arabia.However, it is unlikely that it will completely shut down questions over the royal's handling of the Andrew scandal.King Charles was heckled during a visit to Clitheroe train station in Lancashire on Monday, with one member of the public shouting, \"how long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\" as he greeted a crowd.Watch: Crowd boos heckler as King visits ClitheroeMountbatten-Windsor had a long-running friendship with Epstein and maintained contact with the American financier after his conviction for a child sex offence in 2008.He has previously apologised for his past ties with Epstein but has strenuously denied any wrongdoing.While reports have emerged in recent years that William favours a further cutting of ties with his disgraced uncle, he and other senior royals have largely refrained from commenting on the allegations against him. The King last directly mentioned Epstein's victims in October when he stripped Andrew of his titles, and last week Prince Edward referred to victims when asked about the Epstein fallout at a government conference in Dubai.Buckingham Palace had said he would leave Royal Lodge in early 2026, but his departure appears to have been sped up, with the former prince now living on the King's privately owned Sandringham Estate.No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken.He has previously questioned whether a picture of him with his arm around Guiffre had been doctored and claimed he had never met her. She alleged she was made to have sex with him as a teenager. But in an email apparently written by Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is also in the image, in 2015, she said: \"In 2001 I was in London when [redacted] met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph was taken as I imagine she wanted to show it to friends and family.\"PA MediaAndrew was pictured alongside his late accuser Virginia Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite now jailed in the US for child sex traffickingHe has always denied the claim and reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.The encounter allegedly occurred at his former Royal Lodge residence in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.But emails show the former prince passing on reports of visits to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and confidential details of investment opportunities, to Epstein.The Royal Family has sought to distance itself from Andrew, beginning in 2019 when it was announced he would step back from royal duties. Since then, he has lost his titles, military offices and official roles, and has only very occasionally been seen at official events.But there has been continued pressure on the Palace to signal a clean break from Andrew as public anger over his alleged conduct continues.",

    "body": "So much for the 'rise of the machines'.BBC Sport's predictions expert Chris Sutton saw off the joint challenge of AI and the Football Manager 26 computer game to triumph last week - his first victory since the start of September.This week, as well as AI, he takes on a human guest, but one who is a star in a different sport - Bath and England rugby player Ollie Lawrence, who supports Chelsea.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image caption, Lawrence, 26, returned from an Achilles injury in time to start the new Prem Rugby season and is in the England squad for the Autumn Internationals. England's next match is against Fiji at Twickenham on Saturday - kick-off is at 17:40 GMT and you can listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra.Lawrence also excelled at football and cricket as a boy, and was with the academies of Aston Villa and Birmingham City, as well as Worcester Warriors, before focusing on rugby at the age of 16.Sutton is a keen cricketer himself, and has regularly turned out for Norwich cricket club in recent years, but says his rugby career did not really take off.\"I only played rugby once, for my school team,\" Sutton said. \"We were really excited on the bus on the way there, but we lost 72-0 and I never played again.\"Anyway, it's great that Ollie played for Villa's academy, but I'd like to remind him I actually played for their first team.\"Being compared to a rugby side is not usually seen as a compliment for football teams, but Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta revealed recently that he has been inspired by New Zealand rugby head coach Scott Robertson.From playing both sports, Lawrence can understand why both coaches have shared ideas successfully.\"It definitely makes sense,\" he told BBC Sport. \"There's lots to learn from both sports, for example in the way teams try to contain the opposition or set up for a counter-attack.\"I saw Paris St-Germain coach Luis Enrique was watching games from the stands recently, like we do in rugby, rather than the touchline. It is only a small thing but it can make a big difference because you see the game from a different perspective.\"Arteta has been using the rugby term 'finishers' rather than 'substitutes' too. I think the first time we started using that was with Eddie [former England coach Eddie Jones] who was massive on the bench having an impact on the game, and I can see why Arteta likes that mindset.\"Image caption, Lawrence was a constant presence at centre for Bath and England before his Achilles injury in March. It robbed him of any further involvement for Bath as they lifted a first league title in 27 years and also the chance to tour Australia with the British and Irish Lions.Lawrence grew up in the midlands but became a Chelsea fan because of their kit.\"A lot of my best mates and my family support Villa, while my dad supports Wolves and my grandad was a West Brom fan - so I had a few different influences there,\" he explained.\"But when I was about five or six I went in a sports shop that had all the different shirts in there. I saw a blue one I liked so I picked that, and my dad said 'you know that's a Chelsea kit?' and I was like 'yeah - but I like it!'\"It was around 2004 or 2005, when Jose Mourinho was in charge, so it was pretty good timing to start supporting them. From then, I have stuck with them through the good times - and the not so good times too!\"Chris Sutton and Ollie Lawrence were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this weekend's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsSaturday, 8 NovemberTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 12:30 GMTIt's hard to know how to view Tottenham at the moment, especially at home where they have been pretty underwhelming in the Premier League so far.Spurs have taken only one point from their past four league games in their own stadium since beating Burnley on the opening weekend of the season, including last week's defeat by Chelsea when a couple of their players gave Thomas Frank the cold shoulder afterwards.They did beat Copenhagen comfortably there in the Champions League on Tuesday, but it is still hard to make a case for them to overcome Manchester United because I am not really sure where their goals are going to come from.Mind you, I am still not convinced by United either. There is no doubt they have shown strong signs of improvement but I still don't fully trust them to turn up, especially on the road.Tottenham beat United four times last season, including in the Europa League final. This time? If I had to pick a winner I would actually back United, but I don't - so I am going for a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Spurs will take this one. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-2Hill Dickinson Stadium, 15:00Everton were superb in the first half hour against Sunderland and, had Thierno Barry not ballooned his shot over the bar from close range at 1-0, they would have gone on to win that game.Instead it was another reminder they are missing a top-class centre-forward. I feel sorry for Toffees boss David Moyes because Beto has also missed so many wonderful opportunities that his side have created this season.Fulham's win over bottom side Wolves last week ended a run of four straight league defeats but it's hard to really gauge their form off that - it was only Wolves they beat.That makes this a really tough game to predict. I don't think there are going to be loads of goals in it, and I can see it ending up in another draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Everton have been playing quite well, but Fulham are a good team. 2-2AI's prediction: 1-1London Stadium, 15:00Which West Ham will turn up? If they rock up and play in the manner they did when they beat Newcastle here last week then there is only one winner, but will we see Nuno Espirito Santo's side play with that same intensity? I thought Freddie Potts did well on his first senior start against the Magpies, Lucas Paqueta was at his mercurial best and Jarrod Bowen impressed me with his strong running.But the problem here is that this is exactly the kind of game where you expect West Ham to win, and they will mess it up.Burnley are awkward opponents and they have got a bit about them. They are nothing like the open and expansive side under Vincent Kompany a few years back.There was a softness about that Clarets side, which simply isn't there any more.So, West Ham are going to have to work hard to win this and maybe Callum Wilson holds the key.He was a nuisance for the Hammers last time out. It meant Bowen did not have to carry the team, and Wilson could make the difference this time too.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Ollie's prediction: West Ham to edge it. 1-0AI's prediction: 2-0Stadium of Light, 17:30Sunderland improved a lot as their game went on against Everton, but they got a real good going-over in the early stages.They cannot afford to start like that against Arsenal, who have superior players and are such a threat from set-pieces too.The Gunners don't have to play well to win, they just grind away until they find a way through.Mikel Arteta's side weren't pretty when they beat Slavia Prague in the Champions League but they don't care, and why should they?Some of the football they play might get people asking whether that is the way you'd want to win a title, but do you think the Arsenal players will be bothered when they are popping open the champagne?It is about knowing how to do it, not how you do it. There is a lot of the old '1-0 to the Arsenal' in this current Gunners team, although I do expect them to take more goals off other teams at times.It is at the back where they are so strong. Can Sunderland cause them problems? Absolutely, but I think this latest Arsenal win will come off the back of another Arsenal clean sheet.Sutton's prediction: 0-2Ollie's prediction: This should be quite comfortable for Arsenal. 0-3AI's prediction: 0-3Stamford Bridge, 20:00Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said after Wednesday's draw with Qarabag that he is rotating his team so much because the Club World Cup is taking its toll on his squad.That must be a factor in their inconsistency, but I don't think it will matter here because Wolves have been such a rabble recently.He has gone now but after last weekend's 3-0 defeat by Fulham, their former boss Vitor Pereira said that technically, tactically and physically they were not at the required level, and I don't expect anything to change at Stamford Bridge.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Ollie on Chelsea's prospects: Hopefully we are making a turn for the better now. We just need to be a bit more consistent, so having a few defenders stay fit would be great and getting Cole Palmer back from injury would definitely help too.Ollie's prediction: I'd back us to win this, it is just whether we can keep a clean sheet. It's either 3-1 or 3-0 so I am going to be confident and say we will keep them out. 3-0AI's prediction: 3-1Sunday, 9 NovemberVilla Park, 14:00Aston Villa were on a really good run until they lost at Liverpool last weekend, and they were quite unlucky at Anfield too.Even so, I find it very difficult to write Bournemouth off in games like this. They can cause any team problems and I always feel like they will score.I admire Villa boss Unai Emery for sticking to his guns tactically. He has his principles and even with people talking about teams having success by going direct this season, he hasn't changed his approach.That might have given Liverpool a bit of encouragement, however, and it may give Bournemouth some encouragement too.Playing in the Europa League on Thursday won't help Villa either, and that toll of games could catch up with them at some point.The Cherries rescued a point with a 96th-minute goal in this fixture last season and I have a feeling it will end up all square this time too.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: Bournemouth are going to score because Antoine Semenyo is on fire, but I am going with Villa to win. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-0Gtech Community Stadium, 14:00I didn't recognise Newcastle when I watched them lose at West Ham last weekend.They were better when they beat Athletic Club at St James' Park in the Champions League in midweek, but their away form - or lack of it - must be a concern for boss Eddie Howe.They are still solid defensively most of the time but scoring goals seems a particular problem for them when they are on the road. I can see why from watching that West Ham game because they just did not work the goalkeeper enough.The way Brentford play under Keith Andrews, he is happy to set them up to play on the counter-attack even when they are at home, and I can see Newcastle struggling to break them down too.I know I have gone for a few draws already this week, but this game smells of another one to me.Sutton's prediction: 0-0Ollie's prediction: This will end up in a draw. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-3Selhurst Park, 14:00The M23 derby is one of my favourite games.Crystal Palace won it home and away last season but it's so hard to call this time.The two teams are next to each other in mid-table, with Palace ninth, one place above Brighton.Both teams won comfortably last week too, but Palace have got the Uefa Conference League on Thursday and that is going to affect them.Without Europe, I probably would have gone for the Eagles to win but the more I think about it, the more I think the Seagulls will get something.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Ollie's prediction: I am backing Brighton to nick this. 1-2AI's prediction: 1-2City Ground, 14:00This is a big game for both teams because they could both really do with a positive result going into the international break.Nottingham Forest nearly got over the line against Manchester United last week and they had a bit of spirit about the way they played, but Sean Dyche is still waiting for his first Premier League win with them and he will want to get that monkey off his back.Leeds have done pretty well at Elland Road but, so far, the only time they have picked up any points or even scored a goal away from home was when they beat bottom side Wolves in September.Their fragility on the road means this is a great opportunity for Forest, even though they play away in Europe on Thursday.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Ollie's prediction: Neither side is doing too well at the moment but I feel like Forest's luck has to turn after last season. 1-0AI's prediction: 2-1Etihad Stadium, 16:30Did Liverpool turn a corner with their great win over Real Madrid in midweek? Maybe, but this will show us where they are really at.I feel like a lot of the time these two teams have cancelled each other out when they have met in recent years, but this time it feels like a game they both have to try to win - and it is City I am backing to come out on top.The big call for all Fantasy Premier League managers is whether to triple-captain Erling Haaland. I am not going to do that, but I do think he will score - seriously, how can you go into any game at the moment and think he won't?Whoever wins this, I feel like both teams are fighting for second place anyway, because I don't see anyone catching Arsenal now.People sometimes get angry when I say things like that but I do think they will win the title from here and I have changed my prediction from before the season started, when I went for Liverpool. I don't often do that so early, but I don't think Liverpool can win it any more - we've already seen in the first 10 games how, defensively, they are too vulnerable, and then you look at how good Arsenal are at the back.It is a similar story with City. I feel they will need Rodri at his very best to push the Gunners, but his injury problems don't appear to be over.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Ollie's prediction: I can see this being a game where City go 2-0 up, Liverpool get back into it and then City score another one at the end. 3-1AI's prediction: 2-2How did Sutton do last week?Chris was trailing the collective efforts of the BBC readers until the final two matches of week nine, but then got two exact scores from Manchester City's 3-1 win over Bournemouth and Everton's 1-1 draw at Sunderland.That meant Chris ended up with eight correct results from 10 matches, including those two exact scores, for a total of 140 points.He edged out the BBC readers, who got seven correct results with two exact scores, for a total of 130 points.AI, who won outright for the first time in week eight, did not come close to a repeat triumph. It got six correct results with one exact score, giving it 90 points.Chris' guests, the computer game Football Manager 26 and Miles Jacobson, the studio director of the company behind it, finished further back.FM26 got four correct results with no exact scores for a tally of 40 points, while Miles got four correct results with one exact score, giving him 70 points. That meant they ended up with an average score of 55 points that counts towards the guests' total in the table below.Weekly wins, ties and total points after week 10WinsTiesPointsChris40770Guests21640You20910AI11760Source: BBCGuest leaderboard 2025-26PointsJames Skelly190James Walsh110Addison from JJFC100You *91Rod Jones80Chris Sutton *77AI *76Kid Wild& Miles Jacobson70Mark Collins& Tommy Longhurst60Blanco, Orlando Bloom,Theo Ellis & Tom Grennan50Football Manager 2640Aya from JJC30Katherine Parlour10* Average after 10 weeksSource: BBC",

Alongside Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York and the governor races in New Jersey and West Virginia, the party also won important - albeit less glamorous - races in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\nIn this episode, Justin, Anthony and Sarah unpack how and where the Democrats won, and what it means for the party and next year’s midterm elections.\nFor Republicans, the inquest has already begun into a bruising night for the party that has raised fears ahead of the 2026 midterms and the party’s congressional majority. Donald Trump is blaming poor results on the ongoing government shutdown and his name not being on the ballot.\nAnd we’re joined by Jim Messina, a Democrat strategist and former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama. He gives his take on what he thinks lies behind Tuesday’s wins, what he thinks the party has learned since 2024 and whether he agrees with Prop 50 - the redistricting measures passed in California to redraw the state’s political lines to favour Democrats.\nHOSTS:\n* Sarah Smith, North America editor\n* Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Jim Messina, Former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Alix Pickles and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "10 hours agoDharshini DavidDeputy economics editorThere is a buzz outside the Bank of England.City workers are taking advantage of the unusually mild weather to enjoy lunch outside, and there has been a shift in temperature too inside the Bank.The decision to hold rates at 4% was made by the narrowest of margins, and the interest rate panel thinks inflation has peaked.Governor Andrew Bailey said he wanted to see if forthcoming developments confirmed this view before cutting rates; weakness in the labour market could also play a part.The Bank also noted last year's Budget measures – such as an increase in employer National Insurance Contributions and minimum wages – contributed to price pressures over the last year.A key factor in future decisions will be the contents of the forthcoming Budget, which may ease price pressures with direct measures on bills, but also tax rises  taking money out of pockets.The chancellor has been keen to claim credit for creating the conditions for rate cuts by providing the right environment. But the Bank's report makes clear that last year's Budget measures have contributed to price pressures, and hiring hesitancy by adding to employer's costs.Ironically it is the impact on the labour market that may have contributed to views of the rate setters already looking to cut the cost of borrowing.While the Bank itself refused to speculate about the contents of this Budget, it noted signs that concerns elsewhere, among consumers and businesses, may be holding back the economy. With consumer spending remaining cautious, it expects the economy to grow by 1.2% in 2026, less than the 1.5% it predicts this year - that will not be welcomed in the Treasury.The interest rate panel will have plenty to evaluate in the Budget – the scale and shape of tax rises, help with energy bills and possibly other cost of living challenges, and increases in the National Living Wage.According to the Bank's research, labour costs remain a key uncertainty for employers and also for consumer prices.The rate setters will have to judge the impact of those policies – and the usual monthly evidence on inflation, jobs and so forth – by the next meeting in mid-December. By, in effect, holding the cast vote, it's the governor who may find himself deliberating whether to play Santa – or Scrooge.If not then, economists reckon a cut will come in February. And how many more to follow?The Bank says it sees rates continuing on a \"gradual downward path\". Some members remain nervous about lingering inflation pressures. Its research, for example, shows our expectations of inflation are shaped by recent experience, and in particular, the movements of food prices. We are still reeling from the exceptional pace  of price hikes in recent years and that can lead people and businesses to behave as if inflation is higher than it really is - through wage demands or price increases.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of homeowners will still face rising costs when renewing their mortgages as rates remain higher than a few years ago: they've been slower to come down than they were to go up.Borrowers may expect more gifts in 2026, but they may arrive only gradually.",

    "description": "A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps,",
    "body": "A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, and accused the administration of withholding the food aid \"for political reasons\".Judge John McConnell said in his order on Thursday that without the aid, \"16 million children are immediately at risk of going hungry\".The programme is used by about 42 million - or about 1 in 8 - in America and helps those with low income afford groceries.The administration at first planned to halt its funding entirely this month due to the government shutdown, which is now the longest in US history, but had been ordered to doll out at least partial payment.The judge, who is based in Rhode Island, also criticised President Donald Trump for saying that benefits would only be distributed after the government shutdown ends, calling it \"an intent to defy the court order\".He granted a request from several local governments and non-profit groups that asked that the government provide full food benefits, rather than the 65% that had been ordered to be paid out this month. Judge McConnell, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, ordered that benefits be paid by Friday, adding that any further delay would be \"simply unacceptable\".\"This should never happen in America,\" he continued.He added that the government \"knew there would be a long delay in paying [partial] SNAP benefits and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer\".Why the US government has shut down and what happens now‘I have to get what I need right now’: Americans brace for expiry of critical food benefitsThe White House has yet to respond to the judge's latest decision. After Trump had earlier vowed to withhold aid until the shutdown ends, his spokeswoman clarified that the administration would comply with the judge's order. Democracy Forward, an advocacy group which brought the lawsuit, praised the judge's ruling as a \"major victory\".\"The court could not be more clear — the Trump-Vance administration must stop playing politics with people's lives by delaying Snap payments they are obligated to issue,\" Democracy Forward President Skye Perryman said in a statement.More than 42 million Americans received Snap benefits, however the programme has been in limbo during the more-than-month-long shutdown.While individual US states administer the benefits, the programme relies on money from the federal government, which has been unfunded and shut down since 1 October.Late last month, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which runs Snap, said it would not distribute food-assistance funds entirely starting 01 November because of the shutdown, saying: \"The well has run dry.\"Half the states and the District of Columbia sued the administration over the food-aid freeze and argued that they had a legal obligation to keep the programme running in their jurisdictions.Federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled that the administration needs to use $5.25bn (£4bn) in emergency funds to make at least partial payments to Americans.Snap costs about $8bn per month and allows many low-income Americans to buy groceries. It provides them reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy food.A family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.Amid the uncertainty over Snap funding, local governments have been helping direct recipients to charity food pantries which have been holding emergency drives.Cost-saving recipes have also gone viral online, as Americans search for ways to stretch their budget.",

    "body": "McDonald's faces new crackdown on sexual abuse57 minutes agoNoor Nanji & Zoe ConwayBBC NewsGetty ImagesMcDonald's will bring in new sexual harassment training for managers in strengthened measures agreed with the equality watchdog to protect its staff from abuse.The move was \"in response to serious allegations raised\", the watchdog said, after it initially intervened in the company.A BBC investigation two years ago was told that workers, some as young as 17, were being groped and harassed. Earlier this year, McDonald's staff told us they still faced sexual abuse and harassment. McDonald's said it welcomed the new measures, adding that they would \"build on the significant progress we have already made in this space\". But one former worker said the announcement would not make a difference.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is now extending its original plan agreed in 2023 to protect staff at the fast-food chain from sexual harassment.The new training will focus on the grooming of young workers and the use of social media.McDonald's has agreed to bring in an external body to review whether it was handling sexual harassment claims appropriately, the EHRC said.The new measures apply to McDonald's restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales. Although franchises are not directly party to the agreement it is expected that they will adopt some of the action points.McDonald's - A toxic workplace for teenagers?The fast-food chain signed its legally binding agreement with the EHRC in February 2023.The BBC first began investigating working conditions at McDonald's after that agreement was signed. In July 2023, the BBC heard from more than 100 current and recent workers at the fast-food chain who claimed they faced sexual assault, harassment, racism and bullying.At the time, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.But since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations, while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.In January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.One former McDonald's employee, who previously spoke up as part of the BBC's initial investigation, said she did not think the changes would make any difference.\"They've looked at what they can possibly do, in terms of what will sound promising enough, but not actually what will bring change,\" she said.\"I don't actually think they have any personal desire to make the change, I don't think they care enough,\" she added.\"It's a check box for them to tick, like just with the training, it's something on a to-do list and they think they'll do it and it'll go away, but it just won't happen.\"Earlier this year, law firm Leigh Day said it had been instructed to start legal action against McDonald's by hundreds of staff and former staff, with more than 450 restaurants implicated in the claims.\"I think we can assume that the equality watchdog wouldn't be taking this action if things were ok at McDonald's,\" Leigh Day employment lawyer Kiran Daurka said.\"They already had their initial agreement with McDonald's in 2023. So the EHRC appear to be concerned that not enough progress has been made.\"Ms Daurka said the firm would like to see \"more interrogation\" of the relationship between the corporate side of the business and the franchises, \"as we've seen how issues of sexual harassment can fall between the gaps\".Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, said: \"After serious allegations were raised, we decided we needed to update the action plan with stronger actions that were more specific to the way McDonald's operates.\"We're pleased with the significant steps McDonald's has agreed to take towards a safer working environment for its staff and recognise the hard work they've done so far.\"Other measures to which McDonald's is now committing include strengthening risk assessments and continuing to encourage staff to speak out when something feels wrong.It will work with external experts to design and implement a new safeguarding plan to protect vulnerable workers, to be rolled out across McDonald's restaurants and franchisees' restaurants.\"Once completed, the actions that make up this legal agreement will ensure that there is zero tolerance for harassment at McDonald's and there are clear routes to report and resolve complaints if it does occur,\" Baroness Falkner said.Ian Hodson, national president of the Bakers Union which represents food workers, said there needed to be \"real change\" at McDonald's.\"It's a huge problem. Workers should be entitled to go work without being sexually harassed, and employers should have a duty to act,\" he told BBC News.Other claims the BBC heard include:A 19-year-old worker said managers would \"touch up\" other members of staff and some colleagues were scared of going into work. He quit the branch in the Midlands last year.A 21-year-old worker said managers had inappropriately touched her and customers sexually harassed her. When she raised it, she said she was told to \"suck it up\". She quit her job in the West Midlands at the end of 2023.A 16-year-old employee based in the West Midlands said he had been bullied, shouted at and sworn at by managers.A 20-year-old said a male manager had sent her topless pictures. She left her McDonald's branch in the East of England in August last year.Earlier this year, the watchdog wrote to every McDonald's in Britain warning that their owners could face legal action if they failed to take steps to protect staff from sexual abuse.The boss of McDonald's in the UK has been summoned twice to Parliament to answer questions in front of MPs since the BBC's initial investigation.In January, Alistair Macrow said 29 people had been dismissed over sexual harassment allegations over the past 12 months. Mr Macrow left McDonald's in September.A McDonald's spokesperson said: \"Over the last three years, alongside our franchisees, we have embedded an extensive set of robust and far-reaching initiatives, as part of our steadfast commitment to ensuring a safe working environment in McDonald's restaurants.\"We welcome the fact that these measures have been formalised within the latest EHRC agreement. This will build on the significant progress we have already made in this space.\"The agreement incorporates many of our existing measures which have been developed in consultation with leading experts. This includes a range of initiatives, from enhanced training programmes and onboarding practices, to the launch of a new digital Speak Up channel designed with our crew - for our crew, providing a 24/7 channel that reflects the way young people feel most comfortable engaging.\"We are confident the measures we have implemented are working and making a difference to the 148,000 people currently employed by McDonald's and our Franchisees across the UK today. In the latest anonymous employee survey, 95% of people are aware of ways in which they can speak up.\"We look forward to continuing our work with the EHRC and believe it will help us remain at the forefront of the industry when it comes to creating a safe and respectful workplace culture that embeds safeguarding across every one of our restaurants.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues in this story, information and support is available via the BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMattea Bubalo,in London and Aoife Walsh,in WashingtonAndrew Mountbatten Windsor has been asked by Democrats in US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Members of the House Oversight Committee wrote to Andrew in a letter addressed to Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, which the former prince has agreed to leave.The committee does not have the power to compel Andrew to appear in front of them, but said it intends to ask questions related to information on Epstein's network and associates based on the pair's \"longstanding\" friendship.Andrew was stripped of his \"prince\" title last month following months of pressure over his ties to Epstein. He has always denied wrongdoing.Signed by 16 Democrats, the letter asked Andrew to sit for a \"transcribed interview\" in front of the congressional committee investigating the Epstein case.\"The committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,\" the letter read.\"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation.\"In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you co-operate with the committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the committee.\"The committee is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.The invite was a matter for Andrew to consider \"personally\", Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said.\"My view, and this is not about the individual case, more broadly, is that anybody who has relevant information should always be willing to give it to whatever inquiries need that information.\"But the individual decision is a matter for him.\"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said it was \"right\" that Andrew appear before Congress over his links to Epstein. \"He should also give evidence to our Parliament. The public deserve answers and full transparency about this scandal,\" he wrote in a post on X.Buckingham Palace announced last month that Andrew would lose his \"prince\" title and leave his Royal Lodge home as his links to Epstein continued to cause controversy.Ahead of this, Andrew said he had chosen to give up his titles, including the Duke of York. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first,\" he said at the time, adding that the decision had been taken after a discussion with the King. In a posthumous memoir published in October, Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew denies the accusations.The committee addressed those allegations in the letter, requesting the former prince make himself available for an interview \"given these recent events and the appalling allegations that have come to light from Ms Giuffre's memoir and other reliable sources.\"Some members of the committee had already intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions about his links to the late sex offender days after he was stripped of his \"prince\" title.",

Consumers are set to pay between $245 and $350 per month for obesity drugs including Wegovy and Zepbound.Many GLP-1 drugs, used to treat diabetes and obesity, cost over $1,000 a month without insurance or discounts.The deals will expand Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's access to Medicare and Medicaid, the government's public healthcare plans for elderly and low-income Americans.Eli Lilly also said in a statement it would escape tariffs for three years as part of the agreement with the Trump administration.An estimated 10% of Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible for expanded access to GLP-1 drugs, and will only pay $50, according to senior administration officials.Those enrolled in Medicaid will see a rolling start date based on when states sign up to participate, the officials said.Trump has long pushed for \"most-favoured nations\" prices - a policy aimed at aligning drug prices in the US with lower ones abroad.The obesity drugs will be sold at discounted prices on the direct-to-consumer TrumpRx, a government-run website set to launch by January.On TrumpRx, Wegovy and Zepbound will start at $350 per month on average, and drop to $250 within two years, administration officials said. The Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.Along with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, Eli Lilly's weight-loss pill, orforglipron, will be sold for $149 for the lowest dose, Eli Lilly said in a statement. The company's Zepbound medication will cost $299 for a starting dose.Those prices are dependent on Food and Drug Administration approval of the pills.\"Lilly is in a unique position to work with the US government to rebalance the global system, expand access and lower costs for Americans,\" David Ricks, Eli Lilly's chief executive, said in a statement.GLP-1 drugs are often not covered by private insurance. Federal law bans Medicare from covering the drugs when used for weight loss, though they usually are covered when used to treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Only 13 states provide coverage under Medicaid for weight loss purposes.Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, speaking at the White House, said the deals were products of months of negotiations with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. He called obesity \"the number one driver of chronic disease\" in the US.\"This will be a lifesaver to them,\" Kennedy said. \"It's not a panacea, it's not a silver bullet,\" he added, stressing the importance of dietary changes and physical exercise.Since July, Trump has been pressuring pharmaceutical firms to lower drug prices. He sent letters to 17 drug companies in the summer, giving them 60 days to respond to his demands for lower prices.Pfizer was the first major drug maker to reach a deal with Trump, slashing prices for some medicines by up to 85% on the TrumpRx site. Pfizer also agreed to lower prescription drug prices for Medicaid.AstraZeneca and EMD Serono have also reached deals with the administration in recent weeks.",

    "body": "7 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorFour senior figures in the Greek coastguard, including its current commander, are to face criminal prosecution for negligent manslaughter in connection with a 2023 migrant boat disaster in which up to 650 people are thought to have drowned.The fishing boat Adriana went down off the Greek coast near Pylos. Survivors told the BBC that the vessel capsized after coastguards made a botched attempt to tow it.Greek authorities have always denied any wrongdoing over the shipwreck.Now a prosecutor at the naval appeal court in Piraeus has recommended that the current head of the Hellenic coastguard, Vice Adm Tryfon Kontizas, and three other senior officers should go on trial.Among the charges cited by the court of appeal are manslaughter by negligence in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone, exposure by negligence with a legal obligation to rescue people that resulted in death and repeated exposure by omission of other people to danger.The Adriana had left Libya for Italy in June 2023 and was monitored by a Greek patrol vessel for some 15 hours off Pylos before it went down. Some of the 104 survivors later revealed that a coastguard vessel had caused the boat to sink by towing the boat away too fast when the boat was unbalanced.Although only 82 bodies were recovered, hundreds more people are believed to have died.Prosecutors at the maritime court in Piraeus decided earlier this year that 17 members of the Greek coastguard should face charges, including the captain of the coastguard ship, the-then head of the coastguard Vice Adm Giorgos Alexandrakis and the supervisor of the national search and rescue centre.However, they cleared Tryfon Kontizas and three other senior officers of blame. Vice Adm Kontizas had been appointed coastguard chief a few weeks before the court's decision.That decision not to prosecute the four officers was then challenged by lawyers for survivors and relatives of the victims.Greece has always maintained it fully respects human rights and has rescued more than 250,000 people at sea in the past decade.",

    "body": "COP30: World leaders take aim at Trump for climate inaction5 hours agoEsme Stallard,Climate and science reporter, BBC News and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondent, BBC NewsPablo Porciuncula/AFPBrazilian President Lula warned of \"extremist forces\" when he addressed world leaders at the global climate summitUS President Donald Trump has been criticised by world leaders for his stance on climate change, ahead of the global COP30 summit.President Trump, who is not attending the meeting in the Amazonian city of Belém, was called a liar by the leaders of Colombia and Chile for his rejection of climate science.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the waning political support on climate change. He said it had been a unity issue internationally and in the UK but \"today sadly that consensus is gone\".Over the next two weeks countries will try and negotiate a new deal on climate change, with a particular focus on channelling more money to forest protection.Many leaders from the world's largest nations – India, Russia, US and China - are notably absent from this year's summit.And while Trump isn't attending this meeting in Belém, his views on climate change are certainly on the minds of many of the other leaders present.Speaking at the UN in September, the US president said that climate change was \"the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world\".He said: \"The entire globalist concept, asking successful industrialised nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies, must be rejected completely and totally.\"Without naming the US leader, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil warned on Thursday of \"extremist forces that fabricate fake news and are condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming\".The leaders of Chile and Colombia went further, calling the US president a liar, and asking other countries to ignore US efforts to move away from climate action.Maisa Rojas, Chile's environment minister, told the BBC: \"The science is very clear. It is very important not to falsify the truth.\"But while Trump-bashing went down well with the audience, getting agreement on new steps to tackle warming is proving much harder.Only a few dozen leaders have turned up here in Belém, and a majority of countries have failed to submit new plans to cut carbon emissions, the root cause of rising temperatures.AFP via Getty ImagesOuteiro Port in Belém was recently expanded to accommodate cruise ships acting as \"floating hotels\" for COP30 delegatesDespite Starmer acknowledging that global political support for the climate movement is waning, he told the gathering of those that were present: \"My message is that the UK is all-in.\"However, on Wednesday night, in a blow to the Brazilian hosts, the UK chose to opt out of its flagship $125bn (£95bn) fund to support the world's rainforests.President Lula hoped that $25bn could be raised for the Tropical Forests Forever Facility from public sources – mainly from developed countries like the UK – to support governments and communities protecting the world's rainforests like the Amazon and the Congo Basin.The protection of these ecosystems is crucial for tackling climate change - they cover just 6% of the world's land, yet store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases and host half of the planet's species.The move by the UK has come as a surprise as it had been heavily involved in the fund's design, and launched a global commitment for countries to halt deforestation by 2030 when it hosted the COP summit in Glasgow in 2021.Lord Zach Goldsmith, who worked on the issue when he was former environment minister, told the BBC's PM programme: \"The assumption was that the UK would be a leading participant and at the last minute the UK has walked away. It has caused real frustration to put it mildly here in Brazil... the Brazilian government behind the scenes is furious.\"The decision also seems at odds with the stance of the Prince of Wales. Also addressing leaders on Thursday he declared the fund \"a visionary step toward valuing nature's role in climate stability\" and shortlisted it for his £1m Earthshot Prize.COP26: World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030'Let us rise to this moment': Prince William and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer address COP30Prince William tried to encourage leaders to overcome their differences and move forward with action. \"I have long believed in the power of urgent optimism: the conviction that, even in the face of daunting challenges, we have the ingenuity and determination to make a difference, and to do so now,\" he said.And he urged them to take action for the sake of their children and grandchildren.\"Let us rise to this moment with the clarity that history demands of us. Let us be the generation that turned the tide - not for applause, but for the quiet gratitude of those yet to be born,\" he said.From Monday, countries will spend two weeks negotiating further action on climate change - with crucial questions on how to raise finance previously pledged for those already affected by the worst impacts of climate change.The last few weeks have seen devastating extreme weather globally. Hurricane Melissa, which hit the Caribbean last week, is one of the strongest the island nations have ever experienced - resulting in the deaths of more than 75 people. Recent analysis from Imperial College has suggested that climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with the Category 5 hurricane by 16%.ReutersResearchers at Imperial College believe climate change increased the extreme rainfall associated with Hurricane Melissa, which caused at least 30 deaths and widespread flooding in Haiti (pictured)Additional reporting by Ione Wells and Justin Rowlatt",

    "body": "Manfred Goldberg, a Holocaust survivor who dedicated his life to educating school children about the genocide of European Jews during World War Two, has died aged 95.Mr Goldberg was just 11-years-old when he, his mother Rosa and his younger brother Hermann were deported to the Riga Ghetto in Latvia in 1941 before he was moved to the Stutthof concentration camp in Poland.After being liberated by the British army in May 1945, Mr Goldberg and his mother moved to the UK the following year to be reunited with his father who escaped just before the war began. His younger brother did not survive.He was made an MBE by the King in September for his services to Holocaust remembrance and education.\"He was truly extraordinary,\" said Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, adding: \"Manfred understood the power of education. He spent decades sharing his story with young people across the country.\"At the beginning of the year, Mr Goldberg visited children in Shropshire to talk about his experiences, describing the \"hell on earth\" that followed when the Nazis closed his Jewish school in Germany, where he was born in 1930, and deported him.Between then and being imprisoned in a number of concentration camps, Mr Goldberg's brother was taken away, \"his fate unknown\", said the trust.When he came to the UK, Mr Goldberg learned English and went on to complete an engineering degree. Learning was important to him, according to the trust \"having been forced out of education as a young child\". In 1961, he met his wife Shary and they went onto to have four sons, several grandchildren and one great grandchild.Mr Goldberg visited a school in Newport earlier this year as Holocaust Memorial Day marked the 80-year anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp on 27 January 1945.He told pupils: \"My purpose for coming here is because what happened must never be forgotten, in order to make sure it can never ever happen again.\"He said: \"Once people understand what the Holocaust represents, I think every single one of them contributes to preventing it ever happening again.\"Silence never helps the oppressed.\"More than six million Jewish men, women and children were murdered by the Nazis between 1939 and 1945. Hundreds of thousands of Romani people were also killed by the regime, as were gay men and political opponents of the Nazis. ",

    "body": "10 minutes agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondentWatch: Tesla shareholders cheer Elon Musk's $1tn pay dealTesla boss Elon Musk has had a record-breaking pay package that could be worth nearly $1tn (£760bn) approved by shareholders.The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm's annual general meeting on Thursday.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm's market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares.The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.Following the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name.\"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said.\"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added.The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade to maximise his payout include raising Tesla's market value to $8.5tn from $1.4tn at time of writing.He would also need to get a million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation.But his early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want Musk to focus on reviving the company's electric vehicle business.ReutersElon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets\"Let it sink in where Musk's head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X.\"His vision of the 'new book' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FDS and robotaxi yet.\"Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla's self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries.Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months.Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk's leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla's biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote.\"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.ReutersMusk said everyone would want an Optimus robotTesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon MuskMusk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company's market value - which he did.But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk.Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge's decision.The new pay package was rejected by several major insitutional investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund - the world's largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla's unusually large volume of retail investors.Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursdays meeting.In recent weeks, members of Tesla's board of directors have helped lobby for Musk's new pay package with a marketing blitz that riled some corporate governance experts.A video posted to votetesla.com showed board chair Robyn Denholm and director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson praising Musk.",

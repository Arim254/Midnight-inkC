    "body": "10 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsGetty ImagesA total of 69 schools in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) will be forced to close on Monday after coloured play sand was recalled due to asbestos risk, the government has said.A recall for the products, which were found to have traces of asbestos in some samples, was issued by Kmart and Target on Saturday. The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) said there was a \"low\" risk that the asbestos could become airborne or fine enough for inhalation.Inspections of the schools are under way and could \"take days\", said ACT Education Minister Yvette Berry in a post on Facebook. She added that air testing so far has come back \"negative to airborne asbestos\" from all schools.This comes after several schools and preschools in the region were fully or partially closed on Friday, after a warning over asbestos risks in children's sand sold by Officeworks. There were also school closures in New Zealand due to fears over sand products, with at least two other schools set to close for testing on Monday according to the New Zealand Herald. Addressing the new closures, Berry said:  \"Unfortunately, these sand products are even more widely used in our schools than the Officeworks products.\"The Australian Competition & Consumer CommissionState Emergency Service volunteers and school staff have been walking through buildings and \"mapping all coloured sand they see\" over the weekend, she added. The ACT government said that people who have been in contact with the product do not require a clinical assessment. Berry said despite the minimal risk, the government is \"required to eliminate risk as much as reasonably practicable\".Up to 23 schools will remain open as they either have \"small stocks\" of the sand or do not have any of the product. The products set out in the recall notice are labelled as Active Sandtub 14 piece Sand Castle Building Set, and Blue, Green and Pink Magic Sand. Asbestos, once widely used in building materials, can release toxic fibres into the air   if disturbed or processed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer. Importing or exporting asbestos or goods containing asbestos is prohibited under both Australian and New Zealand law.",

    "body": "A man has been arrested in connection with a deadly car bomb attack that killed eight people and wounded 20 others in Delhi last week, authorities have said.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said the car used in the attack, which the government has called a \"terrorist incident\", was registered in the arrested suspect's name.They have accused him of conspiring with the alleged suicide bomber. The suspect was a resident of Indian-administered Kashmir, authorities say. The explosion happened near a metro station close to the Red Fort, one of Delhi's most high-profile landmarks.The agency said it had seized another vehicle allegedly belonging to the suicide bomber for examination. So far, it has interrogated 73 witnesses, including people injured in the blast.The blast outside the historic fort was the first such explosion in the heavily guarded city since 2011.Monday evening's attack took place at 18:52 local time (13:22 GMT) when a slow-moving vehicle stopped at a busy traffic signal and then exploded.Within hours of the incident, Home Minister Shah confirmed the explosion had taken place in a white Hyundai i20.Footage from the location showed remains of a charred white car and a number of other gutted vehicles, including an autorickshaw and cycle rickshaws.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the attack a \"conspiracy\", and his government vowed to bring the \"perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors\" to justice.Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said the news was \"extremely heartbreaking\".Police on Thursday said they were investigating any links to the recent arrests of seven men by police in Indian-administered Kashmir.Potential connections to the the recent seizure of 2,900kg of explosives from a Delhi suburb were also being probed, police said.The Red Fort is visited by thousands of tourists every day, and was built in the 17th Century. Indian prime ministers use the Mughal fortress as a backdrop for their annual Independence Day speeches.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPritti Mistry,Business reporter and Marc Ashdown,Business correspondent Nature is not a blocker to housing growth and the government risks missing both its housing and nature targets if it views it as one, a cross-party group of MPs has warned in a new report.The Planning and Infrastructure Bill overrides existing habitat protections, which the government has suggested is a barrier to its target to build 1.5 million houses by the end of this parliament.But in a report published on Sunday, the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) found the measures outlined in the bill are not enough to allow the government to meet its goals.\"Using nature as a scapegoat means that the government will be less effective at tackling some of the genuine challenges facing the planning system,\" the report said.A Ministry of Housing spokesperson said it was fixing a failing system with landmark reforms, which would deliver a win-win for the economy and the environment.The Labour government has promised to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029 as part of efforts to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth.Under its housing reforms, it wants to simplify the planning system to speed up house-building on smaller sites by overriding existing habitat and nature protections.If passed, the draft legislation, which is currently making its way through the final stages in parliament, would instead allow developers to make general environmental improvements and pay into a nature restoration fund that improves habitats on other sites.But the EAC has argued that nature is not a \"blocker\" to delivering housing - it is a necessity for building resilient neighbourhoods.The EAC urged the government to instead focus on addressing a skills shortage in ecology, planning and construction.\"The government must not veer down the path of viewing nature as an inconvenience or blocker to housebuilding,\" the report said. \"In most cases, housing delivery is delayed or challenged due to unclear and conflicting policies, land banking and skills shortages.\" The EAC suggested offering people better incentives to build and live in \"carbon-friendly homes\", or to retrofit existing ones.It outlined a series of recommendations aimed at boosting manufacturing viability of green construction products and alter the tax burden to support eco-friendly homes.Environmental group Friends of the Earth said the government needed to set the right priorities.Paul De Zylva, nature campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: \"This report shows that the Planning & Infrastructure Bill is bad legislation that neither provides the quality homes people need nor truly protects our already depleted nature.\"Instead of attacking newts, bats and our nature laws to justify its growth-at-any-cost agenda, the government would be better focusing on delivering against its legal targets for nature which are at risk of being missed.\"A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government said: \"The Government inherited a failing system that delayed new homes and infrastructure while doing nothing for nature's recovery.\"We are fixing this with landmark reforms, including the Nature Restoration Fund, that will create a win-win for the economy and the environment.\"This will get Britain building the 1.5 million homes we desperately need to restore the dream of homeownership, and not at the expense of nature.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoEmma Rossiter,BBC News and Eleanor Doyle,NewsbeatSky Sports has scrapped its new female-focused TikTok channel, Halo, after it faced a backlash online with its posts described as \"patronising\" and \"sexist\".In a statement posted on social media on Saturday night, the broadcaster said it \"didn't get it right\" and that it would be \"stopping all activity\" on the account.The channel, which was only announced on Thursday, was described by the broadcaster as an \"inclusive, dedicated platform for women to enjoy and explore content from all sports, while amplifying female voices and perspectives.\"However, many on social media criticised the \"little sister\" account, which talked about \"hot girl walks\" and matcha in its content.At its inception, Sky said Halo's aim was \"to build a welcoming community for female fans, whether casual or committed, through fun, trend-led, and relatable content\". One post saw a clip of Manchester City players Rayan Cherki and Erling Haaland combining for the latter to score against Bournemouth, given the caption \"How the matcha + hot girl walk combo hits\".Viewers argued the posts were \"infantilising\" and undermined the work done over the past few years to put women's sport in the spotlight. Among those criticising the channel was Emily Trees, 23, who told BBC Newsbeat that she thought Halo calling themselves the \"little sister\" of Sky Sports was a \"really damaging\" thing to say. \"We've spent the last 50 years trying to come away from the stereotypes around women's sport, and trying to make women's sport seen as an entity in itself rather than just as an extension of what men can do. We deserve our own space, something that's ours. We don't need to be the 'little sister' to anyone,\" she said.GirlsontheBall, a prominent platform covering women's football, voiced its frustrations saying on X they could not \"imagine this is what women sports fans want\".\"Have many thoughts which I will get to when not under a mountain of writing but all I can ask is why? The branding (one day can we please be past the pink/peach stage?!), the premise, the copy…\"Sports fan Millie Jones, 27, told BBC Newsbeat that she did not think women needed a separate space for content, rather, she says, they need to be equally represented in the content Sky Sports already put out.\"As a sports fan, I've consumed generic Sky Sports media for the entirety of the time that I've been into sport. I don't need a pink, glittery sidepiece to the normal content,\" she said.One user said that Sky Sports Halo was one of the worst concepts he had ever seen.\"So condescending. Creating a dumbed down sports channel for women is unbelievably sexist. Incredible that it was approved and that it's still live,\" they said.Some social media users have also created spoof posts of the channel's content which have been widely shared.While the channel was aimed at women many of the sports stars featured in its posts were men.Andy Gill, head of social media and audience development at Sky Sports, wrote on LinkedIn that he \"couldn't be prouder and more excited about [Halo's] launch\", but by Saturday night the broadcaster was forced to rethink.All but two posts have been deleted from the Halo account, one of which is a brief statement from Sky which reads: \"Our intention for Halo was to create a space alongside our existing channel for new, young, female fans.\"We've listened. We didn't get it right. As a result we're stopping all activity on this account. We're learning and remain as committed as ever to creating spaces where fans feel included and inspired.\"The BBC contacted Sky for comment but it had nothing further to add.Correction 16 November: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to one post as having been published by Halo but it was a mock-up not produced by the channel.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentJohnReimberg/XEcuador's interior minister shared this picture following news of Chavarria's captureThe leader of one of Ecuador's biggest drug-trafficking gangs has been captured in an operation involving Spanish police, Ecuador's president Daniel Noboa has said. Wilmer \"Pipo\" Chavarria, the head of Los Lobos, was detained in the city of Malaga, according to Spain's National Police. President Noboa said Chavarria had faked his own death, changed his identity and hidden in Europe while continuing to control criminal operations in Ecuador, including illegal mining and ordering murders.His family had claimed in 2021 that he had died from a heart attack due to Covid.Both Ecuador and the US have designated Los Lobos (The Wolves) as a terrorist organisation.In a post on X, Ecuador's interior minister John Reimberg, who said he was in Spain with police, said the capture of Chavarria was a \"historic day\" for his country.Los Lobos is estimated to have 8,000 members and is one of the most powerful criminal organisations in Ecuador.In June 2024, the US Treasury sanctioned the gang and described it as a group with \"thousands of members\" that had significantly contributed to the increase in violence in Ecuador.Violence and murders have soared in Ecuador in recent years as it has become a major cocaine trafficking hub and rival gangs compete for control. It does not produce the drug, but sits next to major drug-producing countries such as Peru and Colombia.President Noboa has defined his presidency through a tough military crackdown on criminal gangs.The high-profile arrest coincides with a referendum in Ecuador on whether to change the constitution to allow foreign military bases in the country again. The US held one on Ecuador's Pacific coast until 2009, when the left-wing president at the time Rafael Correa did not renew it and banned them constitutionally.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has recently toured military facilities in Ecuador.President Noboa told the BBC earlier this year that he wanted US and European armies to join his \"war\" against what he called \"narco-terrorists.\"The US is expanding military operations in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. It has deployed troops and a naval strike force centred around the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier to the region.Additionally, it has carried out at least 20 strikes on alleged narco-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean, killing at least 80 people.It has not yet provided evidence about those on board and some lawyers have argued the strikes could breach international law.Many Los Lobos members are in jail and the gang is thought to have instigated some of Ecuador's bloodiest prison riots. The gang is thought to have links to the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel in Mexico.",

    "body": "Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is reiterating her calls for the release of all Epstein files, after US President Donald Trump called her a \"traitor\" and said he no longer supports her. Speaking to CNN's State of the Union on Sunday, Greene told host Dana Bash that while she still supports the president, she does not agree with his efforts to keep the Epstein files under wraps.She said Trump's attacks on her are not just perpetuating toxic in-fighting in politics, but also putting her safety at risk.\"He called me a traitor, and that is so extremely wrong, and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,\" said Greene. Greene and Trump's relationship has grown increasingly rocky in the past few weeks  after Greene pushed for the Department of Justice to release all files it has on the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The tension escalated on Friday when Trump condemned Greene on Truth Social calling her a \"traitor\", \"wacky\", and a \"ranting Lunatic\". All she does is \"COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN\", Trump wrote. While Trump's post does not mention the Epstein files, Greene told CNN that her fallout with the president has \"all come down to the Epstein files\". The House is expected to hold a vote this week on whether to release the files to the public, and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie said in an interview with ABC News on Sunday that as many as 100 GOP members could vote in favour.  Known as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the aim of the bill is to make the justice department release all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials linked to Jeffrey Epstein.Trump and Epstein were friends in the early 2000s. The US president has said a falling out ended the relationship before Epstein's legal troubles began and he has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Still, he has faced bipartisan criticism over his handling of the case records.\"I believe the country deserves transparency in these files, and I don't believe that rich, powerful people should be protected if they have done anything wrong,\" Greene told Bash. Greene questioned why Trump is pushing so hard to keep the files from public view, but added that she believes Epstein's victims who she says have told her that Trump did nothing illegal. She said she's also focused on ending hate and division in politics, which she said is splitting apart American families, friends and neighbours. \"I think America needs to come together and end all the toxic, dangerous rhetoric and divide, and I'm leading the way with my own example, and I hope that President Trump can do the same,\" she told Bash. It's a stark messaging shift for Greene, who has previously been accused of stoking political divisions by promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories and elevating controversial posts on social media. She liked a post that called for the executions of former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, and posted a photo of herself holding a gun beside images of three progressive Democratic congresswomen. When Bash brought up some of these examples, Greene reiterated her past apologies and said a core part of her Christian faith is forgiveness.  ",

    "body": "20 hours agoNikita YadavBBC News, DelhiFor millions across northern India, the November air tastes ashy, the sky looks visibly hazy and merely stepping outside feels like a challenge.For many, their morning routine starts with checking how bad the air is. But what they see depends entirely on which monitor they use. Government-backed apps like SAFAR and SAMEER top out at 500 - the upper limit of India's AQI (air quality index) scale, which converts complex data on various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, into a single number. But private and international trackers such as IQAir and open-source monitoring platform AQI routinely show far higher numbers, often shooting past 600 and even crossing 1,000 on some days.This contradiction leaves people asking the same question every year: Which numbers should they trust? And why doesn't India officially report air quality beyond 500?India's official air-quality scale shows readings above 200 pose clear breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Readings above 400 and up to 500 are classified as \"severe\" and affect healthy people while also seriously impacting those with existing diseases. The scale however does not go beyond 500 -  a cap set more than a decade ago when the National Air Quality Index was launched.So why was that threshold introduced?\"It was assumed that the health impact would be the same no matter how much higher it goes because we had already hit the worst,\" says Gufran Beig, founder director of SAFAR. He admits that the 500 cap was originally set to avoid creating panic as crossing that mark signalled an alarming situation requiring immediate mitigation.But this approach effectively flattens the data - anything above 500 is treated the same on official monitors, even if the real concentration is far higher.\"International organisations and portals don't impose such a cap,\" says Mr Beig. \"That's why we see numbers going much higher on global platforms.\"The BBC has reached out to India's pollution control board for a comment.Beyond the artificially imposed threshold, there's also a difference in defining hazardous air.For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines classify PM2.5 levels - particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers - above 15 micrograms per cubic metre in a 24-hour period as hazardous, while in India, the threshold is 60 micrograms.Experts say that globally, there's no universal AQI formula. US, China and the European Union each apply their own pollutant thresholds.\"WHO provides guidelines and every country has built its index based on its own adaptability, weather and local environment,\" says Mr Beig. Comparing India's AQI to WHO or US standards can thus be misleading. Then there is also a difference in the instruments used. The Indian pollution control board uses Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAMs), which physically measure the mass of particles in the air and are calibrated to strict, standardised metrics for every reading.In contrast, portals like IQAir rely on sensor-based monitors, says Abhijeet Pathak, a scientist who formerly worked for India's pollution control board.Sensor-based monitors use laser scattering and electrochemical methods to estimate the number of particles suspended in the air.\"The sensor is a different tool and it is not possible to calibrate them for every run,\"  says Mr Pathak, adding that \"sensor-based air quality monitoring has not yet been approved by the Indian government\".According to him, India's air quality framework hasn't been comprehensively revised since 2009, and he, along with other environmental scientists and activists have called for recalibrating the scale based on the latest technology.\"National Air Quality index will need to be revised if we want to include the sensor-based data,\" says Mr Pathak. Removing the upper cap is also crucial says Mr Beig, \"now that most literature available shows health symptoms keep on worsening as the pollution levels increase\". In the end, India's AQI doesn't stop at 500 because the pollution stops there. It stops at 500 because the system was built with a ceiling.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanai Nesta KupembaBBC NewsFederal agents have descended on the city of Charlotte in North Carolina as part of US President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.In a post on X, US Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said at least 81 people had been arrrested in the city on Saturday. Local officials, including Mayor of Charlotte Li Vyles, released a joint statement criticising the operation, saying it was causing \"unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community.Since Trump's return to office he has deployed troops to Washington DC, Los Angeles and Chicago to deliver on his promise of \"the largest deportation programme\" in US history.The DHS announced \"Operation Charlotte's Web\" on Saturday, saying \"criminal illegal aliens\" would be targeted in the Democratic-run city.\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said.Armoured vehicles and special operations teams could be involved in the North Charlotte crackdown, according to internal government documents seen by the BBC's US partner, CBS News. Several church members doing yard work at a church in east Charlotte fled into woods when agents arrived and detained one man, The Charlotte Observer reported, quoting the church's pastor. \"We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,\" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.Officials said there are \"a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters\".The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to \"sanctuary policies\".Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a \"certified welcoming city\". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.  \"President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,\" the DHS said.Charlotte is an ethnically diverse city, with about 17% of residents being born outside of the country, according to Data US. DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown, which began in September is still ongoing. Earlier in the week, US Representative and Democrat, Alma Adams, said she was informed of the operation and was \"extremely concerned\" about Border Patrol and ICE agents coming to North Carolina. The next city on Trump's list is set to be New Orleans, according to CBS, and that as many as 200 agents could be deployed to the city. Operations in previous cities like Chicago and Los Angeles have come under fire over concerns of excessive use of force.",

Gillian McKeith appeared to faint after she was voted to do her seventh trial in 2010.When does the show start?I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! is set to return on ITV1 and ITVX on Sunday 16 November at 21:00 GMT, and will air every night while the series is on.The end date has not been confirmed yet.However, the series usually runs for around three weeks, which would put the finale in early December.",

It will leave behind drier, calmer, and significantly colder weather. Snow is possible on higher ground in the northern half of the UK by Tuesday.The cold snap comes as people rally together to help residents and business owners recover from unprecedented flooding in Monmouth, Wales.The River Monnow has reached record levels - exceeding those recorded during Storm Dennis in 2020 and Storm Bert in 2024. A major incident declaration early on Saturday was rescinded on Sunday afternoon, the fire service said.While that low pressure system has been replaced by mostly calm and dry weather, Sunday and Monday could bring a few wintry showers on exposed eastern coasts. Highs of 5–10°C are expected across much of the UK in the coming days.By Tuesday, low pressure brings rain and sleet, with snow possible on higher ground in the northern half of the UK. Cold Arctic air is sweeping across the UK this week, bringing lower temperatures and the risk of snow in some areasMidweek stays cold with brisk northerly winds, and sleet and snow showers are likely, mainly along northern and eastern coasts, as well as Northern Ireland, west Wales, and possibly the moors of south-west England.The significant drop in temperature is due to a change in wind direction.Since the start of this month, there has generally been a southerly wind bringing a very mild, but cloudy, tropical maritime airmass all the way from the Canary Islands.This pattern will change. After being on the warmer side of the jet stream, the UK will be on the colder side of it.Monmouth town centre in Wales flooded after Storm ClaudiaMajor flooding in Monmouth saw people rescued from their homes. Some had to be evacuated to a nearby library.Monmouthshire MP Catherine Fookes said it was a \"really worrying time\" for residents and businesses\" and while the \"big clear up\" continued, its existing flood defences would need to be reconsidered.\"This community is incredibly resilient and kind,\" Fookes said. The town's fire and rescue service said hundreds of homes had been left without power. Flooding has been less severe in England, but an ongoing risk remains, with 24 flood warnings in place.The weather has also triggered major disruption on rail networks.All lines were blocked between Swindon and Bristol Parkway on Sunday morning, Great Western Railway said, with services impacted between London Paddington and Swansea. The disruption is expected to last until 16:00.National Rail has warned passengers to check before they travel and the AA told drivers to avoid travelling in \"hazardous weather\".Additional reporting by Nicholas Bourne",

    "body": "12 hours agoGeorgina RannardClimate and science reporter, Belém, BrazilGetty ImagesAçaí is a popular health food sold around the worldIn a lab in a renovated warehouse on the banks of a churning, brown river in Belém, Brazil, machines are pulping candidates for the next global \"superfood\".Cupuaçu... Taperebá... Bacaba... Like açaí berries - these fruits are rich in antioxidants, fibre or fatty acids.If Brazil has its way, they could soon be popping up on your social media feeds and being sold in fashionable cafes in the UK, Europe and the US.It's part of a bold plan by the country, which is hosting the COP30 UN climate talks, to tackle climate change, protect nature and create wealth in the face of considerable regional poverty.\"There's a lot of superfoods in the forest that people don't know,\" says Max Petrucci, founder of a local company Mahta that sells powdered cacao and Brazil nuts for shakes.The drink he gives me to try is gritty and tastes like chocolate without sugar.Getty ImagesCupuaçu fruit is little known outside of the Amazon\"We're focussed first on nutrition and the health benefits that these Amazonian ingredients provide,\" he explains.But the second benefit, he explains, is \"social and environmental\". He says they pay fair prices and only buy from farmers who practice sustainable farming.It sounds like a marketing pitch and the company's slick packaging promises \"ancestral ingredients\" and the \"power of purple fruits from the forest\". Getty ImagesTaperebá is another Amazonian fruit used for juices in some parts of northern BrazilScientific research into the benefits of \"superfoods\" is limited, but eating Amazonian fruits is generally recognised to be good for you.Larissa Bueno, also at Mahta, explains that they only sell powdered foods - \"similar to Huel in the UK,\" she says.Transporting raw fruits that degrade within days of picking is expensive. But if companies freeze dry ingredients into powders to sell to supermarkets or ship abroad, \"it keeps more of the nutritional value and it's a smart way to keep more economic value in Brazil\", she explains. Getty ImagesAçaí fruit is harvested from palm trees - many in Pará state in BrazilThe lab in Belém's Bioeconomy Park is helping small companies test new ways of preserving fruits.\"People have been eating from these forests for more than 10,000 years. There are many, many, many undiscovered superfoods, \" Max says.The Amazon rainforest, which covers 6 million sq km (2.3 million sq miles), has always been full of natural wealth. But for decades its vast ecosystem has been decaying, with areas chopped down to sell timber or clear space for cattle or crops like soy.This damaged one of the earth's great protections against climate change - trees that soak up planet-warming carbon dioxide.Unusually, more than two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions come from land use and agriculture, rather than energy like most countries. Those emissions mainly stem from cutting down forest or growing vast amounts of food.Getty ImagesSome farmers work on small parcels of land in the rainforest to sell products like coffee or fruitPresident Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to halve deforestation by 2030. In the 12 months to July 2025, rates reached an 11-year low.But the forest is a resource. The nearly 30 million people living in the Amazon region, and across Brazil, need and want to make a living.Brazil is pushing the idea of building a prospering economy by sustainably using natural resources, preserving nature to protect the vitality of the land, and developing valuable products including fuels, pharmaceuticals, and foods.Building this \"bio-economy\" features strongly in its national climate action plan.Sarah Sampaio runs a small coffee company that grows coffee beans in the shadow of trees, using a method called agroforesty - or agriculture that helps cultivate forests. She works with around 200 farming families in the Apui region, which has one of the highest rates of deforestation.CapozoliSarah Sampaio's company grows coffee in the shade in the Amazon\"We plant native Amazonian trees and the coffee together. The trees shade the coffee plants and farmers can also grow their own food around those plants,\" she says.\"When the coffee plant dies, the trees remain as the forest, so it's helping to restore the Amazon.\"The fresh brew I'm given has a light, fruity taste, and she's proud that three of her coffees were selected among the 30 best in Brazil in the national Coffee of the Year competition. \"If we want to stop more trees from being chopped down, we have to provide people with an alternative income, a sustainable way of living,\" Sarah says.Whatever the next Amazonian superfood is, it will need to challenge açaí. The purple berry is grown and eaten in huge quantities in northern Brazil and sold for nearly £10 ($13) per smoothie bowl in parts of London.Getty ImagesBrazil produces around a third of the world's coffeeDamien Benoit sells açaí ice cream in Europe. \"It's very high in antioxidants, in fibres and unsaturated fatty acids, and in different minerals that make it very popular among people who do sports,\" he says.He works with families who keeps four hectares of açai plants in the forest \"with a minimum number of species per hectare that must be monitored.\"\"We make sure children go to school, and gender equality is a huge topic for us,\" he claims.On their own, these small companies cannot feed millions of people and, so far, they've prospered due to grants or capital from charities and funds that invest in companies aimed at protecting nature.CapozoliThe Laboratório-Fábrica in Belém's new Bioeconomy parkAnd there are questions around how much they can be scaled up. If açaí production was expanded into many industrial-size plantations, it could start to cause exactly the same problems that people like Damien are trying to solve.But there's a reason the word \"bioeconomy\" is plastered all over the UN climate talks.\"We need to move from a world dependent on fossil fuels - that is clear,\" says Ana Yang, Director of the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House.\"And if we don't have solutions that are bio-based, we will not be able to do that,\" she says.This is by no means a magic bullet solution to the problem of how to replace fossil fuels with clean energy and use the land in a way that protects nature.Brazil has also promised a four-fold increase in the use of biofuels, which can be controversial, by 2035. Biofuels such as ethanol are often touted as a replacement for fossil fuels, but they can lead to deforestation as demand increases for the crop to burn to make the fuel.Some are concerned this will lead to the unsustainable extraction of timber or sugarcane to export abroad and burn, and the theft of indigenous peoples' land.Ms Yang says it's essential to put safeguards like strong regulation in place.\"Not all bio-based transitions are good,\" she says.\"If they lead to destruction of natural habitat or they don't have good social practices, then it isn't solving the original problem.\"",

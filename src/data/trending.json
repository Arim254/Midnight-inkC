    "body": "5 hours agoLyse DoucetChief international correspondentWatch: BBC asks Trump if breakup of Nato is price he is willing to pay for GreenlandOn day one, he put the world on notice. \"Nothing will stand in our way,\" President Donald Trump declared, to thunderous applause, as he ended his inauguration speech in a cold Washington winter on this day last year, at the start of his second term. Did the world fail to take enough notice?Tucked into his speech was a mention of the 19th Century doctrine of \"manifest destiny\" – the idea that the US was divinely ordained to expand its territory across the continent, spreading American ideals.At that moment, the Panama Canal was in his sights. \"We're taking it back,\" Trump announced.Now that same declaration, expressed with absolute resolve, is directed at Greenland. \"We have to have it,\" is the new mantra. It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.EPA/ShutterstockFrench President Emmanuel Macron spoke at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday but avoided any direct mention of TrumpThere is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.He doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"And he doesn't hide it.\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.ReutersMerchandise opposing a US takeover of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, have appeared in shops in CopenhagenIn the Saudi capital Riyadh in May, we watched how his major speech on his first foreign trip of his second term met a rapturous reception.Trump took aim at the American \"interventionists\" whom he excoriated for having \"wrecked far more nations than they built... in complex societies that they did not even understand themselves.\"In June when Israel attacked Iran, Trump reportedly warned Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to put his diplomacy at risk with his military threats against Tehran. By the end of the week, when he saw Israel's success in assassinating top nuclear scientists and security chiefs, Trump exclaimed: \"I think it's been excellent.\"\"Sane-washing\" was the phrase coined months ago by Edward Luce of the Financial Times to describe the world's polite portrayals of Trump, the succession of leaders landing at his door with glittering gifts and gilded praise to try to win him over to their side.\"Trump's apologists – a more numerous crowd than true believers - work round the clock to sane-wash his policies into something coherent,\" Luce wrote in his latest column.ReutersTrump met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh in May 2025It was on full display last October when leaders the world over were summoned to join him at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh to celebrate his ringing declaration that \"at long last we have peace in the Middle East\" for the first time in \"3,000 years.\"The first significant phase of his peace plan had brought about a desperately needed ceasefire in Gaza and the urgent release of Israeli hostages. It was Trump's muscular diplomacy that forced Netanyahu, as well as Hamas, to agree to it. It was a major breakthrough only Trump could achieve. But it wasn't – sadly - the dawn of peace. No-one there said the quiet part out loud.Last year Trump's approach was framed as manifest destiny. This year it's the early 19th Century Monroe Doctrine now updated, since the Venezuela invasion, as the \"Donroe Doctrine.\" President Trump now owns it, bolstered by his fervent backers on his team, with his belief that America can act at will in its backyard, and beyond, to protect American interests.ReutersIn October, Benjamin Netanyahu called Trump the \"greatest friend\" Israel had ever had in the White HouseSometimes he is called an isolationist, sometimes an interventionist. But there's always that slogan which returned him to power - Make America Great Again.And his letter to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre highlighted his obsessive pique over not winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize. Trump informed Støre: \"I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"\"It's a good day to have a Nordic temperament,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide diplomatically remarked to me when I asked about this moment. Norway has been calm, with ice-hard firmness, in its defence of Greenland and Denmark and collective security in the Arctic.European responses still stretch across this slippery political ice.Macron has vowed to launch the EU's \"trade bazooka\" of counter-tariffs and restricting access to the EU's lucrative market.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, one of the American president's closest European allies, has vaguely spoken of a \"problem of understanding and miscommunication.\"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has strongly and publicly defended Greenland's territorial integrity but wants to protect the strong personal bond he's built over the past year by avoiding retaliatory tariffs.ReutersSir Keir Starmer has maintained a largely cordial relationship with Trump since he started his second term as presidentThe gloves are off for Trump as he posts the private messages he's receiving from leaders using the old tools of statecraft to try to keep him on side.\"Let us have a dinner in Paris together on Thursday before you go back to the US,\" suggested the French president who also queried, in the midst of praise for other foreign policy successes, \"I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland\".\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of the Iran-Israel 12-day war last year.Nato boss commends 'daddy' Trump's handling of Israel-Iran conflictRutte, and others, have credited Trump's blunt threats for forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.\"We have to take the world as it is, not the way we want it to be,\" was the candid reflection of Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney on his trip to China last week.It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear signal of this fast changing world.Watch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyTrump's astonishing threat to annex his neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.Carney, the former central banker, rose to Canada's highest office last year buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world watching.Asked by the New York Times this month what could stop him, Trump replied: \"My own morality. My own mind. It's the only thing that can stop me.\"That's what lies behind an armada of allies now seeking to persuade, flatter, force him – to change his mind.This time, it's not certain they will succeed.",

    "body": "17 hours agoKatya Adler Europe EditorBBCSomething in Europe has snapped. Donald Trump doubled down again on Monday night in his insistence that the US \"has to have\" Greenland for national security reasons. He predicted that Europe's leaders aren't \"gonna push back too much\". But that's not the plan they have in mind when their paths cross with the US president at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday.Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark - a member of the EU and of Nato.President Trump is now leaning heavily on Denmark's allies in both those organisations to abandon Copenhagen and let the US take control of Greenland, or face punitive taxes on all their exports to the United States.It's a horror scenario for European economies, which are already in the doldrums, especially those reliant on exporting to the US like Germany's car industry and Italy's luxury goods market.AFP via Getty ImagesPolls suggest that 55% of Americans don't want to buy GreenlandOn Monday Germany's finance minister said “we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,” after an emergency meeting ahead of the WEF with his French counterpart.The Trump threats landed like a slap in the face of European governments, who (separately, in the case of the EU and the UK) had only just settled tariff deals with the US president last year.\"We're living through uncharted territories. We've never seen this before. An ally, a friend of 250 years, is considering using tariffs… as a geopolitical weapon,\" said France's Finance Minister Roland Lescure.His German counterpart Lars Klingbeil added: \"A line has been crossed... You'll understand that today I'm not saying exactly what will happen. But one thing must be clear: Europe must be prepared.\"All of a sudden, the softly-softly approach to Trump, that Europe's leaders had clearly favoured since he returned for a second term to the White House, seems to have passed its sell-by date.Europe's good cop, bad cop approachIt's too early to read the last rites on transatlantic relations altogether but the EU, at least, is hoping to approach the US president in Switzerland this Wednesday at the Global Economic Forum \"speaking softly, while carrying a big stick\" to paraphrase a former US president.Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt believed that, to achieve your goals, you need diplomacy backed by credible power. And Europe now seems to be adopting a good cop, bad cop approach.European leaders are telling President Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over Greenland.At the same time, EU diplomats have let it be known they're considering imposing €93 billion (£80 billion) worth of tariffs on US goods or even restricting the access of American businesses, possibly including banks and high tech companies - to the bloc's massive single market, if Trump goes ahead with his \"Greenland tariffs\" as they've become known.Bloomberg via Getty ImagesEuropean leaders are telling Trump they'll support him in prioritising Arctic security, so there's no need for him to go it alone over GreenlandThese retaliatory measures would most likely have a knock-on effect on US consumers too.European Union investors have a massive presence in nearly all 50 US states and are said to be responsible for employing 3.4 million Americans.The EU has a weak voice on the world stage of international diplomacy. The bloc is made up of 27 often bickering countries. But it has huge clout when it comes to the global economy and trade, where decisions are largely taken by the European Commission on behalf of EU single market members. The European Union is the world's biggest trader of goods and services, accounting for nearly 16% of world trade in 2024.So, Brussels is crossing its fingers that President Trump will climb down from from his maximalist position and negotiate a compromise solution, if he realises, that he may end up gaining an island (Greenland) but he'll probably lose close allies (Europe), and be seen as responsible for US consumer costs going up (because of EU retaliatory tariffs).\"Our priority is to engage, not escalate,\" EU Commission deputy spokesperson Olof Gill said on Monday.WPA Pool/Getty ImagesEurope needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security\"Trump is forcing the Europeans to grow a spine,\" says Niclas Poitiers, an economist and expert in international trade at the Brussels-based Bruegel think-tank.\"[While] the damage of [Trump's] tariffs is very manageable for Europe… the much bigger question here is not economic but security and foreign policy.\"The EU cannot afford not to react.\"Trust in US security guaranteesBut on Monday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared less than impressed.Speaking in Davos, he painted a picture of a US president with his mind set: \"The president is looking at Greenland as a strategic asset for the United States. We are not going to outsource our hemispheric security to anyone else.\"European tariff retaliation would be \"unwise\", he warned. And here Europe feels stuck. Damned if it takes action. Damned if it doesn't.Some in Europe worry that if they are now more confrontational with Trump, they risk alienating the US even further.And the brutal truth is: Europe needs Washington to secure a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine and for its own continental security. Despite pledging more defence-spending, Europe is still heavily reliant on the US.Getty ImagesThe Danish Navy patrols near Nuuk, Greenland earlier this monthWhile also reiterating his support for Danish and Greenlandic sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, was at pains to make that point on Monday, saying it was in the UK's \"national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence.\"Our nuclear deterrence is our foremost weapon. A deterrent when it comes to securing the safety of everybody in the United Kingdom is my primary duty and that requires us to have a good relationship with the United States.\"But, if Europe continues to try to \"manage\" president Trump, rather than stand up to him, when he is threatening the sovereignty of his fellow Nato ally (Denmark), and brandishing economic sanctions over other allies if they support Copenhagen, then the continent risks looking seriously weak.ShutterstockIt's in the UK's 'national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defence, to security and to intelligence,' Sir Keir Starmer has saidOn X on Monday the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote, \"We have no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\".As a former prime minister of Estonia, a country that fears the looming shadow of an expansionist Russia, she is keen to demonstrate to Moscow that Europe can - and will - bare its teeth, if pushed.\"Europeans can't shy away anymore,\" Tara Varma told me. She's an expert in security and geopolitics at think tank, German Marshall Fund.\"They tried personal diplomacy alone [with Donald Trump] over the last year, in order to try and tie him into Europe's collective defence and guaranteeing Ukraine's security after a ceasefire with Russia,\" she said.But if he can suddenly turn around (as he just has), linking economic and security issues and threatening Nato, if he doesn't get his way over a certain issue, then, she says, how much trust can Europe ultimately put in US security guarantees under this administration?\"Putin and the Board of PeaceWatching all this from the sidelines is not only Russia, but China. In their eyes the West - traditionally with the US and Europe tightly-knit at its core, dominant for decades in global politics - is now unravelling.The world is increasingly dominated by a number of big powers, including Russia and China, but also India, Saudi Arabia and, to an extent, Brazil.China hopes Donald Trump's apparent fickleness with his allies may make Beijing appear a more stable, reliable partner and drive more international trade its way.Canada, which President Trump had threatened to make the 51st state of the US, has just agreed to a limited trade deal with Beijing. It's trying to reduce its exposure to Washington.AFP via GettyThe Kremlin has said that Vladimir Putin was invited to join the Board of PeaceThe US president has also shown little regard for multilateral institutions like Nato and the United Nations set up by western powers after the second world war, to manage global order.Some point to the Board of Peace that President Trump is now establishing, and that he reportedly wants to stage a signing ceremony for this Thursday in Davos. Many world leaders and leading business figures are attending the conference.The Board is ostensibly designed to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after Israel's devastating two year offensive, aimed at destroying Hamas following its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.But the Board's charter calls for \"a more nimble and effective international peace-building body\", suggesting its remit would be far wider, possibly to rival the UN.AFP via Getty ImagesFrance does not plan to accept an invitation that it has received to join the Board of Peace, according to a sourceThat's how France's President sees it. A source close to Emmanuel Macron issued a statement on Monday saying that France did not plan to accept an invitation that, \"along with many countries\", it had received to join the Board of Peace.\"The [Board's] Charter... raises major questions, particularly with regard to respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question under any circumstances,\" the statement reads.The Kremlin said on Monday that Vladimir Putin had also been asked to join the Board, suggesting that Trump is keen to maintain ties with the Russian president, despite Moscow's four-year long assault on Ukraine and its failure so far to accept a US-backed peace plan.Questions have been raised too about Trump's overarching role on the Board, and his demand that world leaders pay $1 billion for permanent membership.More from InDepthBut Tara Varma insists that the Peace Board isn't about peace. \"How can it be, if you invite leaders like Putin to be part of it?\"Trump wants to be seen as a peacemaker. He wants the headlines, but without doing the hard graft to lay the groundwork needed for peace to be durable. His is more of a hit and run strategy.\"He can't replace multilateral institutions like the UN that have been around for 80 years.\"Relations are strained but not brokenPerhaps, though, President Trump, with his flouting of decades-old international norms, is shaking some of these multilateral institutions up a bit, pushing or even forcing them to modernise and become more relevant.The membership of the UN security council should arguably be less western-centric, and more representative of changes in global power structures.Nato's European members have admitted they ought to be paying more for their own defence. Trump is not the first US president to say that they should, though he's far blunter.It was after he threatened that the US would no longer defend nations that didn't pay their way, that all Nato members except Spain agreed to dramatically increase security spending.Back to Greenland, polls suggest 55% of Americans don't want to buy the island and 86% oppose a military takeover by the US. Denmark and other European powers have been lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill to persuade them that Greenlandic and Danish sovereignty must be protected.Getty ImagesAsked if he was prepared to use force to seize Greenland, President Trump said, \"No comment\", sending chills down the spine of many GreenlandersTransatlantic relations aren't broken yet, though they are damaged. Donald Trump is still picking up the phone to his pal, the Italian premier, Giorgia Meloni, to Starmer, and to Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte. Lines of communication are still open.Ultimately, though, if Europeans want to try to cut through with Donald Trump, they will have to stick together.Not only the EU's disparate member states, not just Nato: all countries together. And the UK, with its closer relationship with the US will be key here.But Europe's leaders are torn between wanting to do what they see as right internationally, and their own domestic concerns. If a full-blown transatlantic trade war were to break out, that would hurt their voters.All singing from the same sheet over Greenland for any length of time, is going to be tough.Top picture credits: Getty Images and Getty/Bloomberg/LightrocketBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "4 hours agoYasmin RufoLeicester SquareHe has built a career on high-speed chases, bruising fight scenes and gravity-defying stunts, but Jason Statham says that even after decades in action cinema, he is still determined to push himself \"a little bit further than the last time\". Speaking to BBC News at the premiere of his latest film Shelter, Statham admitted that his commitment to doing his own stunts has sometimes comes at a cost. \"There have been a lot of stunts where I went too far,\" he says. \"When you get hurt, a lot of the time you think, 'why did I do that, why didn't I get a stunt man to do that?' \"I've hurt my neck a few times, I've hurt a lot of things a few times and that reminds you of your mistakes.\"Even so, the 58-year-old, who has two young children with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, shows little inclination to step back from the physical demands of his work and has an \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" mentality. \"I like to get in front of the camera and do as much as I can,\" he explains. \"I've spent many years learning different disciplines and given I have the technical skills to take on these complex action sequences, I like to get stuck in.\" Reflecting on age and longevity, he adds that he's \"not that old\". \"As you get into your later years you're less bouncy than when you were 25, but I'm still going,\" he laughs, adding that his secret to longevity is \"lots of physio.\"Shelter sees Statham play a reclusive former assassin whose isolated life is shattered when rescuing a young girl forces him to confront violent enemies and the past he tried to escape.He says what makes this film different is that it has more of a \"thriller element\" to it compared to straight action films. Director Ric Waugh agrees and says the film \"punches you in the gut\". \"I don't like using visual effects where nothing feels real anymore - I make films where everything is real, authentic and grounded because that's what gets people emotionally gripped,\" he explains. One of the film's most challenging moments involved an open-sea rescue sequence, which Statham described as particularly punishing. \"That pushed me really physically,\" he says.\"It's hard to make under water work look good and anyone will know that swimming with a jacket and size 10 boots on isn't easy.\" Despite the intensity of the stunts, Statham says nerves are no longer something he struggles with. \"There's nothing to be nervous about anymore, I've done it for a few too many years now.\" He describes the few nerves he does feel as good ones which comes from a \"desire to do something good and get it right\". Statham also jokes that audiences \"will be sick of me by the end of the year\" as he stars in several films being released in 2026 including Mutiny and a sequel to The Beekeeper. He will also star in Viva La Madness, which reunites him with director Guy Ritchie. \"I own Ritchie a lot as he started my career so I'm excited to be back with him,\" he says, though he wouldn't give anything else away about the project other than that filming will start next week.

    "body": "28 minutes agoEuropean leaders hitting back at Donald Trump's Greenland threat at the World Economic Forum in Davos dominates Wednesday's papers. The Guardian leads with a photo of French president Emmanuel Macron wearing sunglasses while delivering his speech, during which he warned that now was \"not the time for new imperialism or new colonialism\".\"Macron takes aim at 'bully' Trump\" says the Independent, focusing on the French president denouncing \"bullies\" and calling for the \"rule of law over brutality\".The Financial Times reports that the \"rift with Europe deepens\" as Donald Trump continues to stand firm on his intent to seize Greenland. The paper quotes the US leader saying there was \"no going back\" as he opens the door for talks ahead of his arrival in Davos on Wednesday.\"We'll work something out\" is the message Donald Trump sent to Nato allies before his departure for the World Economic Forum, according to the Times. When asked how far he was prepared to go to acquire Greenland, Trump said: \"You'll find out,\" the paper says.In a bid to reassure Donald Trump Europe can defend itself, the i Paper says surveillance units from the UK military could join a \"tripwire\" of troops stationed in Greenland. It adds that the Arctic deployment could include sea and air reconnaissance units.The Metro shifts its focus to Donald Trump's criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a \"stunning\" social media post on Tuesday. The paper fills its front page with a screenshot of the US president's Truth Social message, accusing the PM of \"giving away\" the Chagos Islands where the US has a military base and calling it \"an act of great stupidity\".Following the post, the Daily Telegraph details more criticism from Donald Trump of the UK PM when he spoke to reporters. When asked about his relationship with Sir Keir, Trump said the prime minister needed to \"straighten out\" the UK because \"London is having a lot of problems\".Echoing Donald Trump's attack on the prime minister is Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch writing in the Daily Express. Badenoch says Sir Keir is \"out of his depth\" on the world stage and praised the US president as being \"dead right\" for denouncing the Chagos Island deal.The Daily Star keeps its eye on the fallout from Brooklyn Peltz Beckham's bombshell statement on the family feud with his parents Sir David and Lady Victoria Beckham. \"Becks bites back\" is the headline on the paper's top story as it features Sir David's first comments after his eldest son's Instagram post, saying \"kids make mistakes\".Quotes from think pieces on the Beckham family saga are plastered across the Daily Mail's front page. Elsewhere, the paper reports on national security warnings from spy chiefs to Sir Keir Starmer after the government approved plans for a Chinese super-embassy in London.Finally, the Sun headlines its Beckham coverage with \"Becks, 'lies' and videotape,\" highlighting one of Brooklyn Peltz's Beckham's claims that his mother danced with him \"inappropriately\" at his wedding.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "7 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterWatch: BBC political correspondent Damian Grammaticas explains why the site of the new embassy is controversialThe UK has approved China's plans for a huge new embassy in central London, despite opponents warning it could be used as a base for spying and pose security risks.Security Minister Dan Jarvis said intelligence agencies had been \"integral\" to the process and he was \"content any risks are being appropriately managed\".The decision, which has repeatedly been delayed, had posed a challenge for the government, as it seeks to balance its desire for closer ties with Beijing with warnings of the threat posed by China.It comes as Sir Keir Starmer is expected to visit Beijing early this year, becoming the first UK prime minister to do so since 2018. In a letter, the housing department confirmed that Housing Secretary Steve Reed, who is responsible for planning policy, had given permission for the development to go ahead, subject to certain conditions.The site at Royal Mint Court is close to the City of London and fibre optic cables that carry vast quantities of highly sensitive data, sparking concerns they could be used by China to infiltrate the UK's financial system.However, in its decision letter, the department said there was no suggestion the use of the site as an embassy would interfere with the cables.It added that no bodies with responsibility for national security, including the Home Office and the Foreign Office, had raised concerns or objected to the proposal on the basis of the proximity of the cables.Jarvis told MPs the government had \"acted to increase the resilience of cables in the area through an extensive series of measures to protect sensitive data\".The minister argued that the development brought \"clear national security advantages\", by consolidating China's diplomatic premises from seven sites into a single location.In a joint letter to the home secretary and foreign secretary about the embassy plans, MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum and GCHQ's director Anne Keast-Butler said it was \"not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk\".However, they added a \"proportionate\" package of national security mitigations had been developed for the site. Conditions on the planning approval include that the development must begin within three years, and a steering group of local bodies should be established to manage protests outside the site. BBC visits the location where China plans to put its mega-embassyOpposition parties and some Labour MPs had called for the project to be blocked. Local residents also oppose the plans and are planning a legal challenge.Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel said: \"Keir Starmer has sold off our national security to the Chinese Communist Party with his shameful super embassy surrender.\"Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller said the decision would \"amplify China's surveillance efforts here in the UK and endanger the security of our data - not to speak of the safety of the brave Hong Kongers on British soil\".He added that it was \"categorically wrong\" that the prime minister had \"embraced these threats to further his flirtation with China\".Reform UK said the decision was \"a serious threat to national security\" and \"a desperate attempt by the Labour government to cosy up to the Chinese Communist Party\". China tiesEmbassies act as the headquarters for a country's representatives abroad. Downing Street said they were \"the first line of communication\" between nations and \"those who don't accept this basic premise are either naive or recklessly isolationist\".At 20,000 square metres, China's proposed new London embassy would be the biggest of its kind anywhere in Europe.Approval for the site has long been a priority for China's government, which bought the site for £255m in 2018.The plans were initially rejected by Tower Hamlets Council in 2022 over safety concerns, but when China resubmitted its application in 2024 the government took over the decision.Meanwhile, the UK is waiting for its own £100m plan to redevelop the British embassy in Beijing to be approved by China's authorities.Rejecting China's plans would have risked setting back diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since winning power, Labour has sought closer trade ties with China, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves among several senior government figures to visit the country.However, critics have argued the threat of spying by the Chinese state and its intimidation against dissidents abroad are reasons for a more cautious relationship.",

According to local officials, on Tuesday evening the Rodalies train collided with a retaining wall which fell onto the track between Gelida and Sant Sadurní. Catalonia regional fire Inspector Claudi Gallardo said all passengers had been removed from the train.The incident occurred as heavy storms battered north-eastern Spain, as coastal areas in the east and north-west of Spain are on high alert because of the weather. Eleven ambulances were on the scene in Gelida, Catalonia - around 35km (21.7 miles) west of Barcelona - treating those injured, emergency services said.The local fire service said 35 crews had been sent to the area and one passenger trapped inside the train had been rescued.In a later update it said that no-one remained inside and that its crews were conducting a sweep of the area to rule out any further victims.Emergency services said they had evacuated some of the injured to nearby Moisès Broggi, Bellvitge, and Vila Franca hospitals.As well as the five seriously injured people, six were in a less serious condition and 26 were in a \"mild\" condition, emergency medical services said.MossosLocal police shared an image of emergency services at the scene near GélidaAnother train on the Barcelona commuter network also derailed on Tuesday.\"The axle was struck by a rock dislodged by the storm,\" Spain's rail network operator Adif said in a statement.The train was running between Blanes and Maçanet-Massanes, north-east of Barcelona.No injuries have been reported and services have been suspended.The crashes in Catalonia come two days after two high-speed trains collided in Adamuz, Andalusia, in one of the worst Spanish rail accidents in over a decade.At least 42 people are known to have died after carriages on a Madrid-bound train derailed and crossed over to the opposite tracks and then collided with an oncoming high-speed train.",

    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterElon Musk has suggested he could buy Ryanair and called for its chief executive to be fired amid a deepening spat between the pair. The budget airline on Tuesday branded the Tesla chief executive an \"idiot\", and used the extraordinary row to promote its January sale. Musk and Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary have been trading insults over the past week after O'Leary rejected the idea of using Musk's Starlink technology to provide wi-fi on flights.The two are among the world's most outspoken business chiefs, with Musk the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $769bn (£573bn), and O'Leary running Europe's busiest airline. A statement on Ryanair's X account on Tuesday evening said: \"Perhaps Musk needs a break??\"Ryanair is launching a Great Idiots seat sale especially for Elon and any other idiots on 'X'.\" It came after Musk floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, suggesting that O'Leary should be sacked for rejecting the use of Starlink to provide wi-fi on Ryanair flights.EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.The Irish airline also said O'Leary would hold a press conference in Dublin on Wednesday to \"address\" Musk's latest move.Ryanair's social media is known for its punchy posts, often mocking criticisms of the airline or weighing in on current events.Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.He told Irish radio station Newstalk that passengers would not want to pay a small charge for wi-fi on an hour-long flight, and that Starlink hardware would increase fuel costs because of drag.\"We [would] have to put an aerial antenna on top of the aircraft. It would cost us about $200-250m a year, in other words about an extra dollar for every passenger we fly.\"We can't afford those costs. Passengers won't pay for internet usage... so we're not putting it on board.\"O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\", with Musk using the same insult in response.Airlines have become increasingly important for Starlink, a network powered by thousands of low-earth orbit satellites.The technology is already being rolled out by airlines such as Qatar Airways and United Airlines.Both Musk and O'Leary have been known to court media attention with provocative public statements.",

    "body": "Usha Vance, the wife of Vice-President JD Vance, has announced she is pregnant with her fourth child. In a post on X, the second lady said she is looking forward to welcoming a boy in late July. \"Usha and the baby are doing well,\" a statement posted on Tuesday to the second lady's social media account read. Vance and his wife, Usha, 40, have three young children: Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.Usha Vance (née Chilukuri) was born and raised in the working-class suburbs of San Diego, California, to a mechanical engineer father and a molecular biologist mother who had moved to the US from Andhra Pradesh, India.She met JD Vance as a student at Yale Law School in 2010, when they joined a discussion group on \"social decline in white America\".Before becoming second lady, Usha Vance had a legal career, including a job as a corporate litigator at firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco. She also worked for conservative judges, Chief Justice John Roberts on the Supreme Court and appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the Supreme Court. Usha Vance is the first to have a baby as second lady, though other first ladies have had children while their husbands were in office. First lady Frances Cleveland, wife of President Grover Cleveland, gave birth to daughter Esther in the White House in 1893, followed by a second child, Marion, who was born outside the White House. JD Vance has been one of the most vocal members of the Trump administration in calling for higher birth rates in the US. \"Let me say very simply: I want more babies in the United States of America,\" he said in 2025.

    "body": "Luke Littler won the inaugural Saudi Arabia Darts Masters with an emphatic 8-5 victory over Michael van Gerwen in the final.Littler, who turns 19 on Wednesday, seized control of the match when he raced into a 4-0 lead against the Dutchman.Van Gerwen was able to move within one leg of Littler at 4-3 and 5-4 down but could not forces his way back to the contest.Littler averaged an impressive 104.84, with a much higher checkout rate (61.5%) than Van Gerwen (45.5%).\"Obviously last week it didn't work out in Bahrain but really glad to come over to Saudi Arabia for the first time and be the first winner,\" Littler told ITV4.\"Michael got back into it so I had to find my form again but I'm just really glad to win. As players coming over here, we didn't know what to expect but there's been a brilliant turnout.\"Van Gerwen, who averaged 101.79 but threw two 180s to Littler's six, acknowledged the Warrington teenager's fast start made it difficult for him.\"Being 4-0 down at the beginning of the game didn't really help me but I always keep fighting,\" added the 36-year-old.\"Fair play to him [Littler]. He had a fantastic tournament. Sometimes you have to take it on the chin and move on.\"Players were offered a $200,000 (£149,400) bonus if they could produce a nine-darter but none of the competitors could manage the feat.The two-day event, featuring some of the world's best players was the first to be held in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has strict no-alcohol regulations.It was part of the World Series of Darts, and was held at the 1,000-capacity Global Theater, Riyadh.Nathan Aspinall, who was knocked out by van Gerwen in the semi-finals, said earlier in the day the crowd at the event \"weren't all there of their own accord\".A PDC spokesperson told BBC Sport the organisation was \"delighted to see such strong interest\" in the Saudi event, and Aspinall's comments were \"reflecting on the fact that this was a first-of-its-kind darts event in the region\".The spokesperson said all spectators attended as ticket-holders or guests, adding: \"As with any new market, the atmosphere and crowd make-up can differ from long-established darts events such as those in the UK and Europe.\"Saudi Arabia has staged many major sports events in recent years, including Formula 1 and golf, and will host the men's football World Cup in 2034.

    "body": "Audi have set their targets on becoming \"the most successful team in Formula 1 history\" as they launched their assault on the highest level of the sport.Audi is entering F1 for the first time in its history this season, having taken over the Swiss-based Sauber team.Team principal Jonathan Wheatley described the launch of the new team at a lavish event in Berlin as a \"historic moment\".Wheatley said: \"We're not here to mess around, it's an ambitious project. We're humble. We know where we're starting from and we know where we want to go.\"We want to make Audi the most successful F1 team in history. There are milestones on that journey and we are starting it today.\"Audi chief executive officer Gernot Dollner added: \"Whenever we join a racing series, we join to win and to innovate and to bring motorsport forward. The ambition is to compete at the highest level and to compete for championships by 2030.\"Mattia Binotto, the head of the Audi F1 project, said: \"There is an awareness we are just at the beginning of our journey. We are conscious there are a lot of challenges ahead of us but we are ready for it.\"Although Audi ran its new car at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya last week, the car unveiled at the event was a show car not representative of the actual Audi design.Audi will join the rest of the teams at the first pre-season test, which is to be held in private at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya next week.Audi unveiled a slogan for their new project: \"To start something, stop at nothing.\"Binotto said this described \"our approach to the journey - we aware there may be bumpy periods and failures, but to never stop, to have the passion to grow, it is the mindset to never stop pushing forward.\"He added: \"We spent a long time discussing what our targets should be for 2026, whether it be championship positions or points. It is to become competitive. We need to stay humble. There is much to learn. It is more about the attitude, being here learning. And becoming competitive means average is not an option anymore.\"Wheatley added: \"It is about a commitment, if we are going to start something, we are going to finish it. We are serious, and we are going to do whatever is necessary to make this a success.\"Racing Bulls gave their 2026 car a brief shakedown at a private test at a wet Imola on Tuesday.Their rookie British driver Arvid Lindblad spun at the Villeneuve chicane and the car had to be recovered on a truck. His team-mate Liam Lawson also briefly drove the car at a test that was limited to 15km by F1 rules.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHideharu Tamura,TokyoandKelly Ng,SingaporeThere is little question that the man who killed Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022 will be convicted when the court delivers its verdict – Tetsuya Yamagami himself pleaded guilty to the crime at the trial's opening last year.The 45-year-old is set to be sentenced on Wednesday but what punishment he deserves has divided public opinion in Japan. While many see Yamagami as a cold-blooded murderer, some sympathise with his troubled upbringing.Prosecutors have demanded life in prison for the \"grave act\" of shooting Abe dead. The former PM was a huge figure in public life in Japan, where there is virtually no gun crime - and the country was left stunned by his assassination.Seeking leniency, Yamagami's defence team say he was a victim of \"religious abuse\".  His mother's devotion to the Unification Church bankrupted the family, and Yamagami bore a grudge against Abe after realising the ex-leader's ties to the  controversial church.Abe's shocking death while giving a speech in broad daylight prompted investigations into the Unification Church and its questionable practices, including soliciting financially ruinous donations from its followers.The case also exposed links with politicians from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party and resulted in the resignations of several cabinet ministers.Journalist Eito Suzuki, who covered all but one of Yamagami's court hearings, said Yamagami and his family seemed \"overwhelmed with despair\" throughout the trial.Yamagami \"exuded a sense of world-weariness and resignation\", recounts Suzuki, who began looking into the Unification Church long before Abe's shocking murder.\"Everything is true. There is no doubt that I did this,\" Yamagami said solemnly on the first day of his trial in October 2025. Armed with a homemade gun assembled using two metal pipes and duct tape, he fired two shots at Abe during a political campaign event in the western city of Nara on 8 July 2022.The murder of Japan's most recognisable public figure at the time – Abe remains the longest-serving PM in Japanese history – sent shockwaves around the world.Calling for a jail term of no more than 20 years, Yamagami's lawyers argued that he was a victim of \"religious abuse\". He resented the church because his mother donated to it his late father's life insurance and other assets, amounting to 100 million yen (S$828,750), the court heard.Yamagami spoke of his grievance against Abe after seeing his video message at a church-related event in 2021, but said he had initially planned to attack church executives, not Abe. Suzuki recalls Abe's widow Akie's look of disbelief when Yamagami said the ex-leader was not his main target. Her expression \"remains vividly etched in my mind\", Suzuki says.\"It conveyed a sense of shock, like she was asking: Was my husband merely a tool used to settle a grudge against the religious organisation? Is that all it was?\" In an emotional statement read to the court, Akie Abe said the sorrow of losing her husband \"will never be relieved\". \"I just wanted him to stay alive,\" she had said.Founded in South Korea, the Unification Church entered Japan in the 1960s and cultivated ties with politicians to grow its following, researchers say.While not a member, Abe, like several other Japanese politicians, would occasionally appear at church-related events. His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.In March last year, a Tokyo court revoked the church's status as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.But prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says. But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\". \"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.",

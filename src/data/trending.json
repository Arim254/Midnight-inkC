    "body": "3 hours agoThere's a mix of stories on the front pages of Wednesday's papers. The UK is set to rejoin Erasmus, the EU's student exchange programme, with the announcement expected on Wednesday, the Guardian reports. The paper says the plan would allow students to take part in the EU-wide scheme without paying any additional fees from January 2027. Its top picture spot features US congresswoman Ilhan Omar and an interview where she criticises \"vile\" comments made by Donald Trump.The Times also leads on British students being allowed to rejoin Erasmus, saying the deal is the \"first tangible outcome\" of the PM's reset with the European Union. Elsewhere, the Princess of Wales and her daughter Charlotte are featured on their way to the annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace.The Daily Mail makes its focus the BBC's charter renewal. The paper says the government will consider new ways of funding the broadcaster, including via advertising or a subscription model. This means that fan favourite shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Traitors could be placed behind paywall, the Mail says.In other news involving the broadcaster, the Mirror turns its attention to Donald Trump filing a defamation lawsuit against the BBC over its editing of a Panorama documentary. \"BBC comes out fighting\" is the headline. A BBC spokesperson said: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case.\"The Financial Times splashes on French football star Kylian Mbappé \"settling scores\" as Paris Saint-Germain was ordered to pay him more than €60m (£52.5m) over alleged unpaid wages and bonuses. Also prominent, the government's flagship workers' rights bill has cleared its final hurdle in the House of Lords and is set to become law.The Metro spotlights the story of a nurse who has dedicated her life to saving prematurely born babies. Sarah Alcock has volunteered to support her emergency neonatal unit over the busy Christmas period and her sacrifice has been rewarded with a free holiday for her and her family, the paper says.The i Paper is launching a campaign to end silicosis, a deadly lung disease affecting workers exposed to toxic dust while cutting engineered stone for kitchen counters. The initiative calls for a clampdown on silica dust as health experts and unions demand better protections for tradespeople at risk.A former police officer injured in the 1983 Harrods bomb blast that killed six people is calling for the government to honour those injured in the line of duty, the Daily Express says, in an interview for the 42nd anniversary of the attack.The Sun follows with a story about a woman it says was \"once dubbed Britain's Benefits Queen\" who is now a top businesswoman. Cheryl-Anne Prudham is criticising Labour's decision to cut the two-child cap, the paper says.Finally, the Daily Star reports on a \"thrilling victory for common sense\" and \"joy\" from football fans after Fifa slashed ticket prices for next year's World Cup final.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "13 hours agoLaura GozziFootage supplied by the team of scientists show the scale of the footprints and a recreation of how they were formedThousands of dinosaur footprints dating back 210 million years have been found in a national park in northern Italy.The footprints - some of which are up to 40cm (15in) in diameter - are aligned in parallel rows, and many show clear traces of toes and claws. It is thought the dinosaurs were prosauropods - herbivores with long necks, small heads and sharp claws. \"I never would have imagined I'd come across such a spectacular discovery in the region where I live,\" said Milan-based paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso.Illustrazione di Fabio Manucci, Arch. PaleoStelvioArtist's rendition of a herd of prosauropods walking across a muddy plain during low tide. Smaller footprints suggest the herd also included young specimensLast September a photographer spotted the footprints stretching hundreds of metres on a vertical mountain wall in the Stelvio national park, north-east of Milan.In the Triassic period - between about 250 and 201 million years ago - the wall was a tidal flat, which later became part of the Alpine chain.\"This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure,\" Mr Dal Sasso said.The herds moved in harmony, he added, \"and there are also traces of more complex behaviours, like groups of animals gathering in a circle, perhaps for the purposes of defence.\"The prosauropods, which could be up to 10m (33ft) long,  walked on two legs but in some cases handprints were found in front of footprints, indicating that they probably stopped and rested their forelimbs on the ground.Elio Della Ferrera, Arch. PaleoStelvioPhotographer Elio Della Ferrera snapped the first picture of the mountain wall showing the footprintsElio Della Ferrera, the photographer who discovered the site, said he hoped the discovery would \"spark reflection in all of us, highlighting how little we know about the places we live in: our home, our planet\".According to a press release from the Italian culture ministry, the area is remote and not accessible by paths, so drones and remote sensing technology will be employed instead.The Stelvio national park is located in the Fraele valley by Italy's border with Switzerland, near where the Winter Olympics will take place next year. \"It's as if history itself wanted to pay homage to the greatest global sporting event, combining past and present in a symbolic passing of the baton between nature and sport,\" said the Italian Ministry of Culture.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is ordering a \"a total and complete\" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers going into and out of Venezuela.In a post on Truth Social, he said Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's government had been designated a foreign terrorist organisation and accused it of stealing US assets, as well as \"Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking\". \"Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" he added.His remarks came a week after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. In a statement, Venezuela's government said it rejected Trump's \"grotesque threat\".In his post, Trump said Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it will \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\". Trump also accused Maduro's government of using stolen oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed at least 90 people in strikes on boats it alleged were carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. In recent months, the US has also moved warships into the region. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by instituting stringent sanctions.Last week, the US imposed fresh sanctions on six more ships it said were carrying Venezuelan oil.Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.A day earlier the US said it had seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast. The White House said the seized vessel, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to an American port. Venezuela's government denounced the seizure, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.The US had built up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the days before the raid.It involved thousands of troops and USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier– being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".He added that US lawmakers will on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\".

    "body": "9 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterThe government has ordered an independent review into foreign financial interference in UK politics in response to what it called the \"shocking\" case of Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales. Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).Announcing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\".The review will be led by former senior civil Philip Rycroft and will report back in March. Speaking in the House of Commons, Reed said: \"The facts are clear. A British politician took bribes to further the interests of the Russian regime, a regime which forcefully deported vulnerable Ukrainian children and killed a British citizen on British soil using a deadly nerve agent.\"This conduct is a stain on our democracy. The independent review will work to remove that stain.\"Earlier this year the government published its strategy for \"modern and secure elections\", which Reed said \"will close loopholes that should have been closed long before we entered office\".\"However, in the time since that strategy was published, events have shown that we need to consider whether our firewall is enough,\" he added.He said the findings of the review would inform the government's Election and Democracy Bill, which it plans to publish next year.  The government said the review would conduct an \"in-depth assessment of the current financial rules and safeguards and offer recommendations to further mitigate risks from foreign political interference\".It will also examine whether rules are in place to \"protect our democracy from illicit money from abroad, including cryptocurrencies\".The government described the review as \"a response to the evolving threat posed by political interference to British democracy, including the shocking cases of former MEP Nathan Gill and Christine Lee\".In 2022, MI5 issued a rare warning alleging that Ms Lee was a Chinese agent who infiltrated Parliament and made donations to politicians. Ms Lee has previously said the MI5 alert \"wrongly accused her of knowingly engaging in political interference\" on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.Last month, Gill became the first politician to be jailed under the Bribery Act. He is thought to have received up to £40,000 to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.He was an MEP when he accepted money from Oleg Voloshyn, a man once described by the US government as a \"pawn\" of Russian secret services.Gill was an MEP for UKIP and the Brexit Party, before joining Reform UK, where he served for a brief period as its leader in Wales until May 2021.At the time of Gill's conviction Reform UK said it was glad justice was served, calling his actions \"reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable\".Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Reed replied that the review could look into \"all potential sources of malign foreign financial interference\". Conservative shadow communities minister Paul Holmes also welcomed the review and said all political parties should be consulted during the inquiry.He called for better \"information sharing\" so political parties could more easily be able to \"identify irregular sources\" when accepting donations. Liberal Democrat spokesperson Zöe Franklin expressed concern that \"a small number of extremely wealthy individuals now wield disproportionate influence over British politics - that includes overseas donors\".She urged the government to introduce a cap on political donations. Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies said her party had been \"calling for action in Westminster and the Senedd for months, only to be repeatedly dismissed by this Labour government\".She added: \"Unfortunately, because of the government's delay, there is now no time to implement reforms before the 2026 Senedd elections.\"Asked by reporters if the government was targeting Reform, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"No, this review isn't aimed at any specific party or individual.\"It's about protecting the integrity of our democratic system.\"The spokesman also said the review would focus on contemporary threats and recent cases but it would not consider previous allegations of interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

    "body": "4 hours agoGetty ImagesYoung men are behind the growing popularity of nicotine pouches in Great Britain, a study suggests.Around 7.5% of 16 to 24-year-old-men are using the small sachets that fit under the top lip, compared with 1.9% use among young women and 1% among adults overall.Most pouch users - estimated to be around half a million people - also smoke or vape, and a growing number are using them to give up smoking, University College London researchers found.They say research is needed to determine whether the nicotine-filled pouches could help people quit cigarettes, which contain harmful tobacco and other chemicals.The small, white teabag-like pouches are bought in round, brightly-coloured tins. They contain synthetic nicotine rather than tobacco, and young men have told the BBC they can produce a powerful hit.Sales of nicotine pouches have been going up rapidly in recent years, with the rise driven \"almost exclusively\" by young people using them, especially young men, say the researchers.Less than 1% of young men and women were using nicotine pouches in 2022,  increasing to 4% in March 2025.This is due to the \"aggressive and targeted\" way the pouches are marketed, the study says.\"Marketing of nicotine pouches has been heavily targeted at spaces and platforms that disproportionately reach young men, including sponsorship of Formula 1 teams, promotion at music festivals, reports of use among professional footballers, and influencer marketing aimed at male audiences,\" says Dr Harry Tattan-Birch, UCL researcher and study author.Advertising on social media also tends to reach young men more than young women, he adds.In contrast, over the last three years, adult use has remained low and pretty constant.The findings are based on a survey of 127,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales between 2020 and 2025, published in Lancet Public Health.Ban sales to under 18sBut the rules around how the nicotine pouches are marketed is set to change.Legislation passing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - would ban their sale to anyone under 18, restrict how they are advertised, and give powers to regulate the flavours, packaging and nicotine they contain.The study says this new regulation should be looked at carefully so that it doesn't undermine any potential the pouches have to reduce the harms from smokingThe researchers found that nearly three-quarters of current users of nicotine pouches are men, with half under the age of 25.Around 6.5% of attempts to quit smoking in 2025 involved the use of pouches, they said.It's possible they are also being used to cut down or quit vaping, which is more popular than smoking in young people.There was also a rise in their use in places where smoking is banned.\"The key is getting the balance right, discouraging uptake among young people, without making pouches so restricted that people are pushed back towards more harmful products like cigarettes,\" said Dr Tattan-Birch.While they carry fewer health risks than cigarettes and vapes, there are cardiovascular risks for people using pouches with high quantities of nicotine - and there is growing concern over the damage nicotine pouches do to gums.In other countries, the rules on pouches are far more strict. Nicotine pouches are banned in Germany and the Netherlands, and soon to be banned in France.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has expanded a US travel ban, barring nationals of five additional countries and people travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued documents from entering the US.The White House said the restrictions were intended \"to protect the security of the United States\" and will come into force on 1 January.Full-entry restrictions will be imposed on people from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders.The administration also moved Laos and Sierra Leone, which were previously subject to partial restrictions, to the full ban list and put partial restrictions on 15 other countries, including Nigeria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.Trump, who has tightened immigration controls since returning to the White House in January, said the expanded travel ban was necessary because of what his administration described as failures in screening and vetting systems overseas. Officials cited high visa overstay rates, unreliable civil records, corruption, terrorist activity and a lack of cooperation in accepting deported nationals.The announcement followed the arrest of an Afghan national suspected of shooting two National Guard troops over the Thanksgiving weekend, an incident the White House pointed to in highlighting its security concerns.This is the third time Trump has imposed a travel ban. During his first term, he introduced a similar order in 2017, which sparked protests and legal challenges at home and abroad. The policy was later upheld by the US Supreme Court.The White House said the restrictions would remain in place until affected countries show \"credible improvements\" in identity management, information-sharing and cooperation with US immigration authorities.A number of exceptions apply and the ban will not affect lawful permanent residents, many existing visa holders, diplomats, or athletes travelling for major sporting events. Officials said case-by-case waivers would also be available where travel is deemed to be in the national interest.Countries with full restrictions:AfghanistanBurkina FasoBurmaChadEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLaosLibyaMaliNigerRepublic of the CongoSierra LeoneSomaliaSouth SudanSudanSyriaYemenIndividuals travelling on Palestinian Authority issued or endorsed travel documents are also subject to a full suspension of entryPartial restrictions:AngolaAntigua and BarbudaBeninBurundiCôte d'IvoireCubaDominicaGabonThe GambiaMalawiMauritaniaNigeriaSenegalTanzaniaTogoTongaVenezuelaZambiaZimbabweSpecial case: Turkmenistan (restrictions remain for immigrants but have been lifted for non-immigrant visas)",

    "body": "7 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterThe UK is set to rejoin the Erasmus scheme, the BBC understands, five years after announcing it would end its participation as part of a deal to leave the European Union.Through the scheme the EU provides funding for people to study, train or volunteer in other European countries for up to a year.The UK replaced it with its own Turing scheme in 2021, which funds similar placements worldwide.The government said it would not comment on ongoing talks. Ministers are expected to make an announcement on Wednesday.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had suggested in May that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU.UK students will be able to participate in the Erasmus scheme from January 2027, the BBC understands.Alex Stanley, from the National Union of Students (NUS), said it was \"fantastic that another generation of students will be able to be part of the Erasmus programme\", adding that it would represent a \"huge win for the student movement\".\"Students have been campaigning to rejoin Erasmus from the day we left,\" he said.The Erasmus scheme, named after the Dutch Renaissance theologian, was scrapped in the UK in December 2020, when the government announced its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.Boris Johnson, the then-prime minister, said it was a \"tough decision\" but the scheme had become \"extremely expensive\".He said it would be replaced by the Turing scheme - named after British mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing - which has operated since then.Both schemes are open not just to university students, but also to people doing vocational courses, as well as apprentices and people training at college or school.In 2020, the last year in which the UK participated in Erasmus, the scheme received €144m (£126m) of EU funding for 55,700 people to take part in Erasmus projects overall.The UK sent out 9,900 students and trainees to other countries as part of the scheme that year, while 16,100 came the other way.Glasgow, Bristol and Edinburgh were the three universities to send the most students, with Spain, France and Germany being the most popular destinations for UK students.In the 2024/25 academic year, the Turing scheme had £105m of funding, which paid for 43,200 placements, with 24,000 of those being in higher education, 12,100 in further education and 7,000 in schools.The majority (38,000) of students were from England, with 2,900 from Scotland, 1,000 from Wales and 1,200 from Northern Ireland.Ministers who introduced the Turing scheme in 2021 said it was designed to benefit more people from disadvantaged backgrounds and provide greater support for travel costs than the Erasmus scheme did.It is not yet clear what will happen to the Turing scheme once Erasmus is reintroduced for UK students.Welcoming the news that Erasmus was returning, Liberal Democrat universities spokesman Ian Sollom said it was a \"moment of real opportunity and a clear step towards repairing the disastrous Conservative Brexit deal\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoMax MatzaandNardine Saad,in Los AngelesProsecutors in Los Angeles have filed murder charges against Nick Reiner over the deaths of his parents, Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.Nick Reiner is facing two counts of first-degree murder with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders, District Attorney Nathan Hochman said.He could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if found guilty. He will be brought to court to formally face charges and enter a plea after he is medically cleared by prison officials, Mr Hochman said.The charges came two days after the couple were found dead in their home in Brentwood, California, with multiple stab wounds.The charges also include a \"special allegation\" that Reiner used a knife.During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Hochman said no decision had been made about whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty.The suspect, 32, was also accused of using a \"dangerous and deadly weapon, that being a knife\".He was expected to appear before a judge later on Tuesday for an arraignment hearing, where he would have been formally charged. The district attorney later said it would be scheduled for a later date.Rob Reiner directed several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told the news conference: \"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city.\"\"We extend our deepest condolences to everyone affected by this tragedy.\"Asked whether the murder weapon was recovered, Mr Hochman said that would be revealed in court.Officials said autopsies, which have to be completed, would determine the precise cause, manner and times of death.",

    "body": "4 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterMedExpressMedExpress's social media advert was banned for targeting new mumsAn advert which targeted weight-loss injections at new mums has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).MedExpress's social media post used a harmful gender stereotype which suggested women should prioritise losing weight soon after giving birth, the ASA said.The ad was banned along with two by SkinnyJab and CheqUp for irresponsibly exploiting insecurities around body image. All three firms have removed the ads.It is illegal to advertise prescription-only weight loss drugs to the public. The ASA said the \"scale of the problem\" was worst now as people feel extra pressure to lose weight as part of New Year resolutions.MedExpress's video advert on Instagram featured a woman taking a selfie in the mirror with text reading: \"I wish I knew sooner that I could lose post-baby weight with a medicated weight loss treatment from MedExpress\".The ASA said it understood the weight-loss medication \"carried safety warnings for people who were breast-feeding\". It said the advert was \"irresponsible\" as it \"perpetuated pressure for them to conform to body image stereotypes\".MedExpress told the BBC that as a result of the ASA ban, it had \"strengthened our internal sign-off processes, introduced additional sensitivity checks, and enhanced advertising governance across all conditions and categories we serve.\"Stigma associated with being a certain sizeAll three adverts appeared on social media platforms including Facebook and TikTok where online sellers seek to gain space in the hugely popular weight-loss jab market which is now worth billions of dollars globally. CheqUp's Facebook advert featured a woman looking in the mirror with the quote: \"I don't want to be skinny, I just don't want to be the biggest person in the room\". Complaints to the ASA said this suggested a stigma associated with being a certain size.\"Furthermore, by showing the model looking into a mirror, the ad emphasised physical appearance rather than health,\" the ASA said.CheqUpThe ASA said this model wasn't necessarily unhealthily overweightThe firm had argued that the advert's text focused on the model not wanting to be \"skinny\", but rather wanting to get to a healthy weight - but the advertising watchdog disagreed, saying the model was not necessarily unhealthily overweight in the first place. CheqUp sells prescription-only weight-loss jabs as well as over-the-counter ones, and says it has a three-minute online consultation with a healthcare professional that tests buyers for suitability. Weight-loss jabs have grown in popularity A spokesperson for the company said it moved quickly to comply with the ASA, had removed the advert and was fully committed to taking an \"ethical approach\" to advertising in the health and wellness space.Weight-loss jabs were originally developed to help patients lose weight to control their diabetes, but soon began to be used for cosmetic purposes. They gained further popularity as celebrities such as Adele, Rebel Wilson, Sharon Osbourne and Tesla-owner Elon Musk were open about the rapid weight loss they've experienced using the jabs.Meanwhile, SkinnyJab's video of its founder talking about weight loss injections was not an educational and informative resource, as the firm had argued, but was in fact an advert and subject to the ASA's regulations. It said the firm could not promote prescription-only medicines to the public in future by, for example, using the term \"SkinnyJab\" in marketing material. The firm said it had removed the advert and was conducting a full review of its branding, terminology and communications.",

The film is based on real life post-war table tennis star, Marty Reisman. The semi-fictionalised film version Marty Mauser, however, has some dubious morals, getting involved in a heist and trying to destroy the marriage of his biggest sponsor, who he resents.Despite his questionable on-screen actions, Chalamet is a big fan of his character.\"You know, when you're in your early twenties, you're an idiot,\" he laughs. \"And this movie, in large part, is about being an idiot in your early twenties. \"And if on top of that, you have a passion that you're singular about, you risk looking foolish in addition to being an idiot.\"A24Chalamet stars as table tennis player Marty Mauser in his latest film Marty SupremeMarty Mauser exudes the same confidence that Chalamet demonstrated while collecting his best actor SAG Award this year for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.During his acceptance speech he pontificated: \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats,\" before listing Daniel Day Lewis, Marlon Brando, Viola Davis and Michael Jordan, as people who inspired him. I ask where his confidence comes from. \"You know, it ebbs and flows. And I feel like that's kind of what keeps me on my toes,\" he says, being far more humble than he was on stage at the SAGs, wearing a bright green shirt and leather suit.  \"It's my New York mentality insofar as if I'm on a movie or in a social situation, if things are going well, you feel great. And if not, the world's falling apart,\" he says, becoming far more introspective than I had expected.\"And I think increasingly in my life, like as I approach 30 here in a couple weeks, you want to be more on your feet. You want to grow into yourself. But that is a constant learning process. And it's a huge learning curve. And I try not to be too hard on myself or those around me who are also growing.\"Getty ImagesAt the SAG Awards in February, Chalamet said he wanted to be \"one of the greats\"The actor's landmark birthday presents the perfect chance to ask him how he looks back at his twenties, a decade in which he has twice been nominated for best actor at the Oscars, and starred in huge box office hits including Dune and Wonka. A huge smile comes over his face as he says: \"It's been great. You know, it's been awesome. \"I feel like I'm living in a dream. I'm on top of a fancy hotel in London and talking about a film I'm deeply passionate about. \"And, you know, I got to offend somebody from Scotland the second they walked in, with my English shirt,\" he jokes, referencing my barely disguised displeasure at his choice of interview garb. Chalamet's dedication to roles is part of his success. He spent five years learning to play the guitar for A Complete Unknown; for Marty Supreme he embarked on seven years of table tennis lessons. \"I got approached with this project in 2018. So that basically gave me six, seven years to prepare on and off. In all my downtime, I would train as much as possible,\" he enthuses.\"I think the responsibility in this movie, like in the Bob Dylan movie, if you were a Dylan fan or a guitar player, that that looks real to you on screen. Similarly here, if you're a ping-pong aficionado, that that looks believable to you.\"His dedication included taking his table tennis table into the desert during Dune and it was oompah-loompah ping-pong between takes on Wonka.And he's already learning skills for film roles way in the future. \"I can't give anything away, but I do have a couple of white rabbits up my sleeve.\"Getty ImagesMarty Supreme also marks Gwyneth Paltrow's first film role for seven yearsOne thing that is totally clear, is his love of the big screen.In the same month that Netflix has announced its intention to buy one of the major film studios, Warner Bros, Marty Supreme is a film which will have a wide cinema release and has not been made for any streaming service. It has been produced by A24, the independent film company behind recent Oscar favourites Moonlight, Past Lives and The Brutalist.\"That is an intense question,\" Chalamet muses after I ask him if he thinks cinemas will actually survive the length of his career.\"I do think with streaming stuff, there's less incentive for these streaming companies to try to put things in theatres, which is dangerous.\"But equally, I do think cinemas will survive and thrive. And that's not to be a false optimist.\"And he wants to play his part.\"I feel like my responsibility as a young actor especially, is less to go, 'Hey, how do we get people to revisit this traditional form?' And rather to go, \"Hey, how do we take this traditional form and bring it to people?\"Chalamet sincerely believes that Marty Supreme will, in its own way, help cinemas be saved.\"This is an original film at a time where a lot of original films aren't made.\"And there's no part of me that's a salesman that's saying this, but I've never been more confident in saying, \"Hey, if you bring yourself to see this movie, you won't be let down. It's really like a slingshot.\"Timothée Chalamet – about to turn 30 and more than ready to channel his inner Susan Boyle and dream his dream.Marty Supreme is released on Boxing Day.",

Residents said they feel \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" by what has happened.\"I was walking my dogs...I saw the police at the corner and as I glanced down the alleyway I saw some more police,\" said local resident Star Barzey.\"I'm horrified that a young child has been [killed], I mean that is shocking\".Glynis Field, who has lived in the area for 49 years, said: \"I've never seen so many police cars in all my life, and ambulances, armed police.\"To think that's right on our doorstep… It's awful, terrible, absolutely terrible.\"Margaret Jones, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"The chances are that I would have seen her playing out, because a lot of the children round here play out here, it's a horrible thought.\"It saddens me… I find it sad that I may have spoken to her and known her.\"Police have asked the local community to remain \"patient\" as inquiries are carried out at the house and in the surrounding area.There will also be an increased police presence in the streets around the crime scene in the coming days, although Avon and Somerset Police stressed it was not aware of any risk to the wider public.",

Made a smart save to deny David Brooks, but didn't have much more to trouble him. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Ezri Konsa: </b>The Aston Villa defender was moved to right-back as John Stones came into the centre and the absence of the injured Reece James. Konsa looked solid as he has done in the past when playing in that position for England and offered an attacking outlet. Not tested defensively. <b>6</b></p><p><b>John Stones: </b> His first match under Thomas Tuchel since he became England manager. Stones stepped into midfield to start attacks and it was an extremely comfortable return to international football after his injury troubles. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Marc Guehi:</b> The Crystal Palace defender was his usual composed self at centre-back. Produced a great piece of play to keep the ball in and set up Morgan Rogers for his opening goal. Guehi must be a first-choice defender for England. <b>7</b></p><p><b>Djed Spence: </b>Not anything of note to deal with defensively on his first start for England. A good outlet in attack and continues to be a versatile asset. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Declan Rice:</b> Captain for the night and lived up to the honour. Bossed the midfield with his running power and dictated the game with his passing. His corners and free-kicks were always quality. <b>8</b></p><p><b>Elliot Anderson:</b> Continues to make the number six position his own. Plays with maturity but still only 22. Has a real chance to become a key part of the England team. <b>7</b></p><p><b>Morgan Rogers: </b>A favourite of Tuchel and one of the big options as a number 10. A great moment for him to score his first England goal and his powerful running caused Wales problems throughout the match. <b>8</b></p><p><b>Bukayo Saka:</b> The Arsenal winger was a constant threat on the right wing - just as he is for his club. He scored the goal of the match with a real moment of quality when he cut in on his left foot and curled a shot into the top corner. <b>8</b></p><p><b>Anthony Gordon:</b> Started the match on the left wing and was then moved to striker after Ollie Watkins was withdrawn. He played with his usual energy and pace and contributed to a solid win.<b> 7</b></p><p><b>Ollie Watkins: </b>Got his chance in Harry Kane's absence and won't get an easier goal with a finish from a couple of yards out. But missed another good opportunity and a collision with a post led to injury and a half-time withdrawal. <b>7</b></p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"England-substitutes\"><span>England substitutes</span></h2><p></p><div><p><b>Marcus Rashford:</b> The game was won when he was introduced at half-time and Wales were a lot more compact, which meant he didn't have much space to run into. Gordon tried to set him up for a tap-in but the ball was cut out. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Ruben Loftus-Cheek:</b> The AC Milan midfielder came on for his first appearance since 2018 when Tuchel changed the midfield three. Kept it simple. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Morgan Gibbs-White: </b>Came on for the final 20 minutes but with all the substitutions from both sides, the game was disjointed. Still tried to make things happen like he always does. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Jordan Henderson: </b>Brought on as the deepest midfielder and for his experience. Very vocal as always and tried to keep the standards high when the game was won. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Jarrod Bowen: </b>Introduced on the right wing and had one positive run which ended with him playing in Gordon for a strike. <b>6 </b></p><p><b>Myles Lewis-Skelly: </b>A late replacement for Stones. Comfortable recieving the ball in tight spaces and another appearance for the 19-year-old. <b>6</b></p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Wales-starting-XI\"><span>Wales starting XI</span></h2><p></p><div><p><span>By</span><span>Dafydd Pritchard</span></p><p><span>BBC Sport Wales at Wembley</span></p></div><div><p><b>Karl Darlow:</b> Powerless to stop England's flurry of early goals and made a decent low save from Anthony Gordon before the floodgates opened. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Jay Dasilva:</b> Struggled to contain the elusive Saka and did not see enough of the ball to make an impression going forward. <b>5</b></p><p><b>Joe Rodon:</b> Kept busy by the barrage of England attacks, heading and blocking everything that came his way. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Ben Davies:</b> His misjudgement allowed Guehi to set up the opening goal, a rare mistake for one of Wales' greats and now just one cap away from becoming a centurion. <b>5</b></p><p><b>Neco Williams:</b> Had a difficult time against the lively Gordon, getting booked too for a lunging tackle on the Newcastle United winger. Not his usual influential self. <b>4</b></p><p><b>Ethan Ampadu:</b> Usually the heartbeat of the team in midfield but did not have the support around him in the face of world-class opposition. <b>5</b></p><p><b>Liam Cullen:</b> Asked to play in a deeper role in midfield again, the Swansea City forward looked out of his depth and was unable to stop England's runners. <b>4</b></p><p><b>David Brooks:</b> Looked as likely as anyone to spark a Welsh counter-attack. Had a shot on target with a second-half volley and provided substitute Mark Harris with an excellent cross for a good opportunity. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Harry Wilson:</b> One of Wales' outstanding players of recent years but, on this occasion, limited to one speculative long-range effort which went over. <b>5</b></p><p><b>Brennan Johnson:</b> Offered nothing in attack and did little to support Williams defensively. <b>4</b></p><p><b>Kieffer Moore:</b> Ran himself ragged closing down defenders and chasing lost causes, but was isolated as Wales' lone striker. <b>5</b></p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"Wales-substitutes\"><span>Wales substitutes</span></h2><p></p><div><p><b>Chris Mepham</b>: Replaced Davies and defended solidly and forced Pickford into an excellent save with a diving header. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Ronan Kpakio: </b>Gave Wales some energy and impetus on the right after coming on for Williams, combining well with Brooks. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Josh Sheehan</b>: Looked after the ball tidily enough as he usually does at the base of midfield when he replaced Ampadu. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Jordan James: </b>Improved Wales as a midfield force with his dynamism and work-rate when coming on for Wilson. <b>6</b></p><p><b>Mark Harris:</b> Sent a header over following a wonderful Brooks cross. <b>5</b></p><p><b>Lewis Koumas:</b> Tried to run at opposition defenders after replacing Johnson, but had limited opportunities to do so. <b>5</b></p></div><p></p><h2 id=\"How-BBC-Sport-readers-rated-the-players\"><span>How BBC Sport readers rated the players</span></h2><p></p><div><div><div><h2>Player of the match</h2><div><p><span>Number: 7 </span><span>B.

When will you admit that it's a crime? I am ashamed for you.\"</p><p>She also addressed the devastation that had engulfed her family since the trial. </p><p>Her daughter, Caroline Darian, maintains she too was drugged and abused by her father after photos showing her unconscious were found on Pelicot's computer. </p><p>Ms Darian has since spoken about feeling unsupported by her mother. The two are reportedly no longer in contact and Ms Darian was not in court with Gisèle this week.</p><p>\"My family is trying to rebuild itself however it can,\" Gisèle said. \"I hope [Caroline] finds the answers she is looking for. I hope one day we can find each other again.\"</p><p>She also asked to stop being referred to as an icon. \"I am an ordinary woman who dared to open up her trial,\" she said. \"I have become an icon against my will.\"</p><p>As in the original trial, Gisèle ended her statement with a thought for other victims of rape – the majority of whom did not have the wealth of evidence that she had to bring her abusers to court.</p><p>\"I want to say to them to never be ashamed of what was inflicted upon us, because it is not their fault,\" she said.</p></div></article>",

reporters, secretary of state Marco Rubio handed Donald Trump a note that read the words “very close”, followed by a whisper where he told the president that Israel and Hamas were on the brink of reaching a Gaza ceasefire agreement. \nAlthough there are many details of the plan still being worked on, this could potentially be a pivotal moment. Posting on Truth Social, the president said that all Israeli hostages held in Gaza would be released soon in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held in Israel. \nIn today’s podcast, Sarah and Anthony discuss Donald Trump’s role in the process, how much credit he can personally take, and what it tells us about US foreign policy. \nHOSTS:\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Alix Pickles.

When strands of DNA - our genetic building blocks - are damaged, a mechanism is triggered whereby another undamaged strand of DNA is used as a template to repair the break.</p><p>The focus of this research was on a particular protein that is involved in that system of damage sensing and repair.</p><p>When a cell senses the damage, one of the substances it produces is a protein called c-GAS. That plays several roles, but what was of interest to these scientists is that in humans, it interferes with and hampers the process by which DNA is knitted back together.</p><p>Scientists think that this interference could promote cancer and shorten our lifespan.</p><p>In naked mole rats though, the researchers found that the exact same protein does the opposite. It helps the body mend strands of DNA and keeps the genetic code in each cell intact.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68528499\">Whale menopause linked to longer lifespan</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-61045950\">Mutations across species reveal clue to ageing</a> </li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221206-what-naked-mole-rats-can-teach-us-about-treating-cancer\">BBC Future: What naked mole rats can teach us about treating cancer</a></li></ul></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/608c/live/34ffa0c0-a4fb-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Chicago Tribune via Getty Images The image shows a naked mole rat - a small, pink rodent - in an undeground burrow eating a chunk of corn on the cob. \" /><span>Chicago Tribune via Getty Images</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Naked mole rats live in a network of underground tunnels and chambers </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Professor Gabriel Balmus studies DNA repair and ageing at the University of Cambridge.

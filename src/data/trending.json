    "body": "Tottenham expect to complete a 40m euros (£35m) deal for Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher after moving ahead of Aston Villa in the race for the England international's signature.Villa appeared to be in pole position to land Gallagher but the north London club are now closing in on the 25-year-old after expressing a willingness to meet Atletico's 40m euros valuation.Villa preferred to sign the former Chelsea man on an initial loan deal with an option to make the deal permanent.Gallagher is still to formally agree personal terms with Spurs, but that is understood to be a formality.The midfielder is keen to finalise the transfer before Atletico's game against Deportivo in the Copa del Rey on Tuesday night.A move back to the Premier League is likely to suit Gallagher as he tries to break back into Thomas Tuchel's England squad before this summer's World Cup.He has only played once under the German so far, featuring for 59 minutes in the 3-1 friendly defeat against Senegal. Spurs are looking to add to their midfield options after Rodrigo Bentancur was ruled out for at least three months.The Uruguay international suffered the injury in the Premier League defeat at Bournemouth last week and requires hamstring surgery.",

    "body": "Survivors of rape and sexual assault will no longer have to give police access to their counselling notes except in special circumstances, under a new code of practice that came into force on Monday.The Home Office said previously many victims had felt their privacy was \"further violated\" when police investigating crimes asked for notes from therapy sessions.The new code of practice means that professionals, including the police, can only request private material when absolutely necessary and proportionate.Campaigners welcomed the decision, adding that mandatory disclosure of personal details \"forced [survivors] to choose between pursuing justice or healing from trauma\".Up to 30% of rape cases previously involved requests to access counselling notes, according to the Home Office.In some cases, the notes were used to decide whether to proceed with a prosecution, leading to victims being advised to avoid seeking counselling while police investigations were ongoing - despite many rape cases taking at least two years to reach trial.Under the guidance set out in a new Victim Information Request Code of Practice, police requests for counselling notes must meet strict criteria of being necessary, proportionate, and relevant.For example, when an officer believes it could be \"substantially\" valuable to a case. These types of requests must now be cleared chief inspector level before going ahead.In 2024, Labour MP Anna McMorrin told Parliament that a constituent \"had all her counselling records used against her in a harrowing trial that she said was worse than the crime itself\".Charities and campaigners welcomed the changes, which came into force two years after receiving backing from the previous government in April 2024.Rape victims say police investigations causing more harm\"For too long, when a victim of rape reported the offence to the police, they were often put in the impossible position of being forced to choose between pursuing justice or healing from trauma,\" End Violence Against Women said in a statement.Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said she was \"delighted\" with the changes and urged thorough implementation of the new guidance.\"We now need to see strong implementation of the new guidance so that it is followed by police forces across the country, as well as an information campaign to inform survivors and therapists of their new rights.\"Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips that she hopes stopping police routinely access to counselling notes will give victims the \"confidence to come forward and help us bring more predators to justice\".The department said that more than half of rape cases were called off in the year ending June 2025, because of the victim withdrawing support for a police investigation.Phillips added the government would use \"the full power of the state to make this country safe for women and girls\".The Labour government has pledged to halve the rate of violence against women and girls over the next decade. In December, the Home Secretary unveiled their long-delayed strategy.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanandBernd Debusmann Jr,White House ReporterVenezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado will meet President Donald Trump on Thursday,  the White House has confirmed.The visit comes just weeks after Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was seized in Caracas by US forces. But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it  \"a great honour\", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the  Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted.Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: \"She might be involved in some aspect of it.\"\"I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is,\" he said.Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado \"doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country\". \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said.The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez  as Venezuela's interim president.Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.\"Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. But Machado has maintained that her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country.Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoKate Whannel,Political reporter andJonathan Beale,Defence correspondentHead of the Armed Forces Sir Richard Knighton has said the UK is \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\", as he avoided questions about a reported shortfall in the government's defence spending plans.Last week, The Times and The Sun reported that the Ministry of Defence believes it will need an additional £28bn to meet its costs over the next four years, prompting a rewrite of the government's defence investment plan.The plan was due in the autumn of last year but has been delayed.Speaking to the parliamentary Defence Committee, Sir Richard said he could not provide a date for publication but added that the department was \"working flat out\" on it.Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the re-election of US President Donald Trump, the UK, along with other Nato countries, has come under pressure to boost its defence spending.Last year, Labour pledged to increase overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, costing an additional £6bn a year. It has also said spending will rise to 3.5% by 2035.The defence investment plan will set out how new equipment and infrastructure will be paid for and which areas will be prioritised.According to reports, Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Richard delivered the forecast warning of a £28bn shortfall in spending plans to the prime minister and chancellor ahead of Christmas.Appearing before the committee on Monday, Sir Richard confirmed he had met Sir Keir Starmer in December and that they had talked about the defence investment plan but added that material discussed was \"classified secret\".\"I'm not going to talk about that in public,\" he said. He added that despite an \"unprecedented\" increase in spending it was \"a statement of the obvious that we can't do everything we want to do as quickly as we want to do it within the context of the budget set\". \"That requires ministers to make difficult trade-offs.\"The Ministry of Defence has long-struggled to balance its books. The department's analysis in 2023 found that its equipment plan was expected to exceed its budget by £16.9bn and in 2024, the Public Accounts Committee said the UK was facing a £29bn deficit in its spending plans. During the evidence session, Sir Richard was also asked about the UK's readiness to send troops to Ukraine as part of a European reassurance forces, in the event that a peace deal is agreed. He did not provide numbers on how many soldiers the UK would send but said he was confident the Army could fulfil its commitment \"in the short term\".Asked about the UK's domestic preparedness and national resilience in the event of a conflict, Sir Richard said the UK was not doing \"as well as I would want us\". He said there needed to be more work on ensuring infrastructure such as railways and flood defences could be protected against sabotage.Sir Richard was also pressed on whether the UK would have the capacity to treat increased numbers of wounded soldiers in the event of a conflict.He said work on the issue was ongoing but added: \"We don't have a holistic plan for how we would mobilise the NHS in times of all out war in Europe.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentHow significant is Nadhim Zahawi's decision to join Reform?The short answer is that it matters – but it's not without risk for Nigel Farage's party.Let's start with the case for it being an important moment.Zahawi is probably the most significant figure to make the jump from the Conservatives to Reform.In government, he helped oversee the widely praised Covid vaccine rollout. He served as education secretary. And, very briefly, he was chancellor and then the most senior minister at the Cabinet Office, the engine room of Whitehall.Nigel Farage has believed for some months that if Reform are to be ready for power, they need to have senior figures with experience of how government works. Zahawi ticks a few boxes in that sense.The former MP also has a compelling back story. He was born in Iraq, but fled with his family when he was a boy. When he arrived in the UK, he didn't speak English. But since then, he has had a successful career in business, including co-founding the polling firm YouGov. His is the story of an immigrant who has risen to be a senior figure in the business world and government.Zahawi joins a growing list of senior Conservatives who have defected to Reform. The BBC's latest tally shows 22 ex-MPs who have now made that leap. Among them are a number of former cabinet and junior ministers. Many of them were among the most vocal supporters of Boris Johnson: Nadine Dorries, Andrea Jenkyns, Jonathan Gullis, Lia Nici, now Zahawi. The list goes on.For a party seeking to replace the Conservatives as the main force on the right of British politics, the attraction of regular defections is clear. Here are people who have been at the very top of the Conservative Party, who no longer think it is fit for purpose. They have all concluded there is a need for something new – and have made the jump to Reform.But this is also where the risks come in.Reform have been highly critical of the Conservatives in power – not least Boris Johnson's record on issues like immigration. Many Reform members despise what the Conservative Party did in power and plenty are sceptical about the idea of sharing a party with former cabinet ministers.You can expect attacks from Reform's political opponents: that the party is increasingly a collection of failed Conservative MPs. The Tories themselves have claimed Reform is becoming a party of \"has-been politicians looking for their next gravy train\".It's a risk Nigel Farage has acknowledged. He claims he has turned down other Conservatives who wanted to join his party, but whom he didn't think were suitable. But the question Farage faces is how many former Tory MPs is too many? Some think he may have already reached the limit.Then there's another risk: Zahawi himself.Tonight, the Conservatives have claimed he was lobbying them just a few weeks ago to be made a member of the House of Lords. A source close to Mr Zahawi has denied he \"begged\" for a peerage – but the Conservatives are accusing their former MP of only making the jump because they wouldn't give him what he wanted.There's also Zahawi's personal tax affairs. He was given the boot by Rishi Sunak after a highly critical report from the prime minister's ethics adviser who said he failed to disclose that HMRC were investigating his tax affairs.This wasn't a small issue – the report found a serious breach of the ministerial code. It was judged that Zahawi had missed multiple chances to be open about his tax affairs. Zahawi called his mistakes careless, but it brought his ministerial career to an ignominious end.Nigel Farage has decided the baggage is worth it – and that the positives of Nadhim Zahawi's defection outweigh the negatives. There's no doubt this is another coup which has got Westminster talking – and wondering who might be next.But the drip drip of former Conservatives joining Reform is not without risk.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJose TembeMaputoSABCCarolina Cecilia Chirindza and Rosita were lifted to safety by a South African helicopter helping recovery operationsShe was seen as a \"miracle baby\" after being born in a tree which her mother had climbed to escape flooding, but nearly 26 years on Mozambican Rosita Salvador Mabuiango has died after a long illness, her sister told the BBC.The sight of the newborn and her mother being winched to safety by helicopter amid the deluged landscape became one of the defining images of the Mozambique floods of 2000 – the country's worst ever.Reflecting on Rosita's life, President Daniel Chapo described her as a symbol for girls in the country.In February 2000, hundreds died and hundreds of thousands of others were forced from their homes after the Limpopo river burst its banks in southern Mozambique.SABCThe TV cameras captured the first images of RositaRosita's mother, Carolina Cecilia Chirindza, was one of those caught up in the crisis.\"It was a Sunday afternoon about four o'clock, and the waters began rising,\" the Red Cross quoted her as saying later in 2000.\"The water was coming right up to the house, and was getting stronger and stronger, so like everyone else in the village, we headed for the trees.\"I put my two small children on my back and tried to climb up. It was very difficult.\"There were 15 of us all together, and we were there for four days. We prayed and prayed.\"We had nothing to eat, and the children cried and cried, but we could do nothing for them.\"In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Carolina went into labour and shortly afterwards she and the newborn were spotted by a South African military helicopter that was helping in the rescue operations.The two became symbols of the aftermath of the disaster, and they travelled to the US later in 2000 to speak to Congress and help raise awareness about what had happened.AFP via Getty ImagesCarolina and Rosita were photographed in Washington in July 2000 during a short trip thereOn Monday, confirming the news of Rosita's death at 25, her sister Celia Salvador told the BBC that she had \"passed away after a prolonged illness. I'm extremely sad. She died of an illness I am unable to explain what it was.\"According to other family sources, Rosita had been battling against the blood disorder anaemia for years. As a result of the worsening of her condition, she had been in hospital for more than two weeks, where she eventually died on Monday morning.\"My God. Very bad news. My condolences to the bereaved family,\" the president told the BBC.\"She was a symbol for girls in Mozambique. That's why, I extend my condolences to all the Mozambican people, especially to Mozambican girls.\"Rosita grew up with her family and graduated from high school in the same rural area – Chibuto – where she was born. She herself had a daughter five years ago.Political analyst Charles Mangwiro described her death as a \"wake-up call for the government to improve service delivery in the entire health system in the country. \"You cannot expect to survive when health professionals complain every day about unpaid salaries for months and about the shortage of essentials like protective materials and antibiotics.\"Despite recruiting more health workers in recent years, analysts continue to describe an overstretched health system short of basic drugs and equipment.Chibuto Mayor Henriques Machava told the press that conversations were under way with the family to formalise the funeral arrangements, which, according to him, would be taken care of by the municipality.More about Mozambique from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka will make a PGA Tour comeback at the end of January under a new returning member programme, following his departure from LIV Golf.The 35-year-old American controversially quit the PGA Tour to join the Saudi Arabian-backed series in 2022 and won five events over four seasons.In December, Koepka announced that he was leaving the lucrative breakaway league despite reportedly having one year left on his contract and he recently reapplied for his PGA Tour membership.  \"When I was a child, I always dreamed about competing on the PGA Tour, and I am just as excited today to announce that I am returning,\" said Koepka, who has agreed to forego any payment from the FedExCup Bonus scheme during the 2026 season and will be ineligible for the Tour's player equity programme between 2026-2030, which could amount to between $50-85m.\"I believe in where the PGA Tour is headed with new leadership, new investors and an equity program that gives players a meaningful ownership stake.\"Koepka's desire to be reinstated appeared to have provided a huge dilemma for the PGA Tour, with rules dicatating that he would not be eligible to play on it again until August, a year after his last LIV appearance.However, he will now line up at the Farmers Insurance Open, which is being played at Torrey Pines between 29 January - 1 February, after being offered an earlier route back on to the PGA Tour. Only players who have been away from the PGA Tour for at least two years and have won The Players Championship or a major over the previous four seasons are eligible under the terms of the newly announced initiative. In a letter to fans, PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp outlined that programme would be only open for the 2026 campaign and was in \"response to a unique set of circumstances\".\"We will continue to aggressively pursue anything that enhances the fan experience and makes the PGA Tour stronger,\" said Rolapp.\"This is part of our commitment to fans, who expect the world's best players to compete on the PGA Tour week in and week out.\"Koepka, who won the third of his US PGA Championship titles in 2023, has also agreed to make a $5m charitable contribution and has already committed to play in the Phoenix Open at TPC Scottsdale held on 5-8 February. Returning PGA Tour members will be expected to participate in a minimum of 15 co-sponsored and approved tournaments in 2026.Brian Rolapp has wasted no time seeking to capitalise on Koepka's LIV departure.It is a bold move and he has been crystal clear in his desire to bring back LIV's biggest talents by offering this return with no suspension time.This is a potentially huge development and LIV will be desperate to hang on to Bryson DeChambeau, Jon Rahm and Cameron Smith. The breakaway tour's future could depend on them staying.It would be hard to see LIV remaining viable if their marquee stars no longer have faith in the project. Rolapp knows this, hence this alpha play by the PGA Tour boss.All three would face financial penalties for leaving early and like Koepka they would not benefit from equity shares in PGA Tour enterprises for five years.But they have already banked big money and returning to a deeper competitive pool and routinely bigger tournaments may be a tempting prospect. Rahm has not been the major force of old since his move to LIV and Smith's form has nosedived.Rahm would also secure his Ryder Cup future by taking this offer, but unravelling LIV team contracts could be a fraught, expensive and litigious process.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump on Monday said he had imposed a 25% tariff on goods from countries with commercial ties to Iran, a move that could put pressure on Tehran as anti-government protests enter a third week.Trump said on social media that the tariff was \"effective immediately\", without offering details of what constituted \"doing business\" with Iran.China is Iran's largest trading partners, followed by Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and India.The new tariff comes after Trump threatened to intervene militarily if Tehran killed protesters. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that military options including air strikes were still \"on the table\".\"Any Country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a Tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.\"This Order is final and conclusive,\" he added.The White House did not share additional information about the tariffs, including which countries' imports will be hit hardest.Anger over the plummeting value of the Iranian currency, the rial, sparked protests in late December, which have grown into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel in Iran, while sources tell the BBC the death toll could be much higher. Thousands more have reportedly been arrested.However, an internet blackout since Thursday evening has made it difficult to obtain and verify information. The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran.Trump has threatened to intervene, and said on Sunday that Iranian officials had called him \"to negotiate\" - but added \"we may have to act before a meeting\".International sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme have had a severe impact on the country's economy, which has also been weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.On 28 December shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the rial against the US dollar on the open market.Iran's currency has sunk to a record low over the past year while inflation has soared to more than 40%, resulting in sharp price rises for everyday items like cooking oil and meat.

    "body": "8 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterGetty ImagesFormer Fed chair and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is one of several economic policy leaders to rally behind Jerome PowellThree former heads of the US central bank on Monday strongly criticised a criminal investigation into chair Jerome Powell, describing it as a bid to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence.In a statement, Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, along with 10 other eminent former officials, rallied behind Powell.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,\" the former officials wrote.\"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" they added.The move by the Department of Justice (DoJ) comes after a year of relentless attacks on Powell by US President Donald Trump.As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has launched personal attacks, calling the Fed chair a \"major loser\" and \"numbskull\".The president said he did not \"know anything\" about the investigation. The Justice Department has been contacted for comment.The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday.  He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings.Powell called the investigation \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly.\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" Powell said. \"Those are pretexts.\"The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like.The DoJ probe \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\", Powell said in his statement.Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department.\"Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job,\" Leavitt said. \"As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find.\"Watch: The unusual move Powell made in disclosing criminal investigationTrump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans.Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle.Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was \"extremely chilling\".\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" Yellen told CNBC.She suggested investors should be concerned about the development.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic.\"Trump is expected to name someone in the coming weeks to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May.But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process.North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence.Global markets also proved \"remarkably resilient\" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates.Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy.Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work.Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an \"unnecessary distraction\" and it could \"undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions\".Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCOne of these images is a real photo, while the other two have been digitally altered by Grok to change what I'm wearing. Can you tell which is real?Here's me, at the end of a pier in Dorset in the summer.Two of these images were generated using the artificial intelligence tool Grok, which is free to use and belongs to Elon Musk.It's pretty convincing. I've never worn the rather fetching yellow ski suit, or the red and blue jacket - the middle photo is the original - but I don't know how I could prove that if I needed to, because of those pictures.Of course, Grok is under fire for undressing rather than redressing women. And doing so without their consent.It made pictures of people in bikinis, or worse, when prompted by others. And shared the results in public on the social network X. There is also evidence it has generated sexualised images of children.Following days of outrage and condemnation, the UK's online regulator Ofcom has said it is urgently investigating whether Grok has broken British online safety laws.The government wants Ofcom to get on with it - and fast.But Ofcom will have to be thorough and follow its own processes if it wants to avoid criticism of attacking free speech, which has dogged the Online Safety Act from its earliest stages.Elon Musk has been uncharacteristically quiet on the subject in recent days, which suggests even he realises how serious this all is. But he did fire off a post accusing the British government of seeking \"any excuse\" for censorship.Not everyone agrees that on this occasion, the defence is acceptable.\"AI undressing people in photos isn't free speech - it's abuse,\" says campaigner Ed Newton Rex.\"When every photo a woman posts of themselves on X immediately attracts public replies in which they've been stripped down to a bikini, something has gone very, very wrong.\"With all this in mind, Ofcom's investigation could take time, and a lot of back-and-forth – testing the patience of both politicians and the public.It's a major moment not only for Britain's Online Safety Act, but the regulator itself. It can't afford to get this wrong.Ofcom has previously been accused of lacking teeth. The Act, which was years in the making, only came fully into force last year. It has so far issued three relatively small fines for non-compliance, none of which have been paid.The Online Safety Act doesn't specifically mention AI products either. And while it is currently illegal to share intimate, non-consensual images, including deepfakes, it is not currently illegal to ask an AI tool to create them. That's about to change. The government will this week bring into force a law which will make it illegal to create these images.And the UK says it will amend another law - currently going through Parliament - which would make it illegal for companies to supply the tools designed to make them, too.These rules have been around for a while, they're not actually part of the Online Safety Act but a completely different piece of legislation called the Data (Use and Access) Act.They've not been brought into enforcement despite repeated announcements from the government over many months that they were incoming.Today's announcement shows a government determined to quell criticisms that regulation moves too slowly, by showing it can act quickly when it wants to.It's not just Grok that will be affected. A political bombshell?The new law that will be enforced this week could prove to be a headache for other owners of AI tools which are technically mostly capable of generating these images as well.And there are already questions around how on earth it will be enforced - Grok only came under the spotlight because it was publishing its output on X.If a tool is used privately by an individual user, they find a way around the guardrails and the resulting content is only shared with those who want to see it, how will it come to light?If X is found to have broken the law, Ofcom could issue it with a fine of up to 10% of its worldwide revenue or £18m, whichever is greater. It could even seek to block Grok or X in the UK. But this could also be a political bombshell.I sat at the AI Summit in Paris last year and watched Vice President JD Vance thunder that the US administration was \"getting tired\" of foreign countries attempting to regulate its tech companies.His audience, which included a huge number of world leaders, sat in stony silence.But the tech firms have a lot of firepower inside the White House – and several of them have also invested billions of dollars in AI infrastructure in the UK. Can the country afford to fall out with them?",

    "body": "13 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC News PersianandJessica RawnsleyA referee and a student are among hundreds of people reportedly killed during massive anti-government protests in Iran.Coach Amir Mohammad Koohkan, 26, was hit by live ammunition on 3 January during protests in the town of Neyriz, his friend told BBC Persian.\"Everyone knew him for his kindness\", they said, adding his family is grieving and \"angry because he was killed by the regime\".Five days later, student Rubina Aminian, 23, was shot from behind during a protest in Tehran, according to human rights groups. \"She fought for things she knew were right\", her uncle told CNN.Nearly 500 protesters and 48 security personnel have been killed in two weeks of protests, a US-based rights group says.Sources in Iran have told the BBC the death toll is likely higher than reported.Demonstrations began on 28 December over the economy in the capital Tehran and have spread to 186 cities and all 31 provinces, according to the Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).The protests have grown into the largest in years, with calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and rule of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The protests led to a government crackdown, with at least 10,600 people reportedly arrested and 496 protesters killed, according to HRANA.Medical staff in Iran have described hospitals overwhelmed with dead and injured patients. BBC Persian verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on 9 January, and the BBC counted 180 body bags in footage from one morgue near Tehran thought to have been filmed on the same night.The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the Iranian government has imposed an internet shutdown since Thursday, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Among the protest victims was Koohkan, who was killed in Neyriz in south-west Fars Province, his friend told BBC Persian. The friend did not witness the incident firsthand, but heard from eyewitnesses at the scene.\"It was far too soon for him, really far too soon. He was so young,\" the friend said.The friend said they had known Koohkan, an indoor futsal (a form of football) coach and referee, for 10 years: \"From childhood he was my coach, then he became like my brother.\"They described Koohkan, who had one brother, as \"someone who didn't like to see people in this state... in this misery\".\"Everyone knew him for his kindness and good nature. The whole town loved him,\" his friend said. \"The family are both grieving and angry. Grieving because they lost their son, angry because he was killed by the regime.\"Also killed was Aminian, a Kurdish student who was shot from behind while taking part in a protest on Thursday, according to three rights groups.Two groups - Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) and Kurdish organisation Hengaw - said she was shot in the head, while the Kurdistan Human Rights Network said she was shot in the back. Both Kurdish groups said she was shot by government forces.The BBC has been unable to independently verify the circumstances of her death.The 23-year-old, whose first name has also been spelled Robina or Roubina, was studying textile and fashion at Shariati Technical and Vocational College in Tehran, IHRNGO said.\"She was a strong girl, a courageous girl, and she was not someone you could control and make decisions for,\" her uncle told CNN. \"She fought for things she knew were right and fought hard.\"He added that she was \"thirsty for freedom, thirsty for women's rights\". \"Overall, she was a girl who was alive, who lived.\"Members of Aminian's family travelled from their hometown in Kermanshah, western Iran, to Tehran to identify her body after learning of her death, a source close to the family told INRNGO.The family had to search through hundreds of bodies of young people killed in the protests at a location close to her college, the source said.\"It wasn't just my daughter; I saw hundreds of bodies with my own eyes,\" Aminian's mother said, in a statement from the source.Iranian authorities allegedly initially refused to hand over Aminian's body to her family, then prevented her burial or mourning ceremonies in their hometown, the source said.The family was reportedly forced to bury her along the road between Kermanshah and Kamyaran.Iranian leader Khamenei has called anti-government protesters \"troublemakers,\" while US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene and said the US military is considering \"very strong options\".Iran has also accused protesters of being backed by the US and Israel.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.Then, more than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.",

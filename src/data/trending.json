    "body": "1 hour agoThe Guardian focuses on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech to European leaders at Davos - saying he took \"aim\" and accused them of being in \"Greenland mode\" waiting for Donald Trump's cue on Ukraine and other international crises. Zelensky also used his \"fiery\" speech to demand greater pressure on Russia as envoy Steve Witkoff arrives in Moscow for ongoing peace talks, the paper notes.\"Zelensky turns on Europe\" says the Independent, highlighting more criticism from the Ukrainian president, saying Europe \"loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\" against Russia.In more developments at the World Economic Forum, the Financial Times pictures Donald Trump front and centre during the unveiling of his Board of Peace in Davos. The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.In UK news, the Time leads with news that former Labour minister Andrew Gwynne is standing down as an MP, paving the way for Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham to a possible run in a by-election to return to the Commons. The paper says the  Sir Keir Starmer's allies will try to block Burnham's return and him potentially mounting a leadership challenge to the prime minister.The i Paper dubs the move \"Operation Stop Burnham\", quoting an ally of the PM who says the Labour party doesn't need \"an Andy Burnham circus\".\"Does Andy Burnham have the bottle?\" asks the Daily Mail. The paper also describes the Labour party \"descending into civil war\" over the news.In other election news, the Daily Telegraph reports that some \"4.5 million people are to be denied a vote\" after more councils in England were given permission to delay local elections in May.The Metro features images of multiple skyscrapers from Donald Trump's \"glitzy Middle East tourist vision\" for a rebuilt Gaza. The pictures are part of the US president's plan to turn the coast of Gaza, which has been devastated by 27 months of bombardment by Israel following the 7 October attacks, into a tourist destination by 2029. \"Gaza or gaga?\" the paper asks.The Daily Star stays with the Beckham family feud, showing Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and his wife Nicola taking a walk in their first public outing since addressing the row. The paper describes the couple as presenting a \"united front\".\"Glad we did it\" is the Sun's headline, reporting that Brooklyn is \"very happy\" at the reaction to his statement on the strained relationship with his parents.\"No regrets\" echoes the Daily Mirror with the same image of the couple at the top of its front page. But for its main story the Mirror describes Donald Trump's comment that Nato troops stayed off the frontlines during the war in Afghanistan as \"shameful\" and an \"insult\" to the more than 400 British troops who died.  Finally, the Daily Express along with campaigners are urging ministers to ensure mental health is a key part of the government's National Cancer Plan. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoMaia DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesDonald Trump has sparked fresh outrage in the UK after saying Nato troops stayed \"a little off the front lines\" during the war in Afghanistan.Labour MP Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, called it an \"absolute insult\" to the 457 British service personnel killed in the conflict, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"How dare he question their sacrifice?\"Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan, said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply\".The UK was among several allies to join the US in Afghanistan from 2001, after it invoked Nato's collective security clause following the 9/11 terror attacks.The US president told Fox News on Thursday that he was \"not sure\" the military alliance would be there for America \"if we ever needed them\".\"We've never needed them,\" he said, adding: \"We have never really asked anything of them.\"\"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,\" he said, \"and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".He said the US had \"been very good to Europe and to many other countries\", adding: \"It has to be a two-way street.\"Thornberry told the BBC's Question Time that the remarks were \"much more than a mistake\".\"It's an absolute insult... How dare he say we weren't on the front line, how dare he?\"We have always been there whenever the Americans have wanted us,\" she said, calling Trump \"a man who has never seen any action\" but was now \"commander in chief and knows nothing about how it is that America has been defended\".She said the US was the UK's \"friend\" but its leader had \"behaved in a way that is bullying, rude, that has deliberately been trying to undermine us, which has been trying to undermine Nato.\"On the same programme, Conservative shadow cabinet member Stuart Andrew also called the comments \"disgraceful\" and \"appalling\".\"There are many people in this country who served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of whom lost their lives, but also many more who came back with life-changing injuries and we should say thank you to them.\"He added that the UK-US special relationship was important for both defence and security, and that in recent weeks Trump had directed conversation to the security of the Arctic - where he said there was a \"very serious threat\".Sir Ed wrote on social media that Trump had \"avoided military service\", adding: \"How dare he question their sacrifice?\"Meanwhile, former British Army officer Obese-Jecty said it was \"sad to see our nation's sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States\".\"I saw first hand the sacrifices made by British soldiers,\" he wrote on X.\"I don't believe US military personnel share the view of President Trump; his words do them a disservice as our closest military allies.\"Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and former RAF officer who served alongside US special operations units in Afghanistan, said the president's claim bore \"no resemblance to the reality experienced by those of us who served there\".\"As I reminded the US Forces I served with on 4 July 2008, we were there because of a shared belief, articulated at America's founding, that free people have inalienable rights and should not live under tyranny,\" he told the PA news agency.\"That belief underpinned the response to 9/11, and it is worth reflecting on now.\"The BBC approached the Ministry of Defence for comment. A spokesperson pointed to comments made by Defence Secretary John Healey while visiting Nato ally Denmark on Wednesday - before Trump's comments.He said: \"In Afghanistan, our forces trained together, they fought together, and on some occasions, they died together, making the ultimate sacrifice.\"The US invaded in October 2001 to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war.More than 3,500 coalition soldiers had died as of 2021, when the US withdrew from the country - about two-thirds of them Americans.The UK suffered the second highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which saw 2,461 deaths.The US is the only country to have invoked the collective security provisions of Nato's Article 5, which states that \"an armed attack against one Nato member shall be considered an attack against them all\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoKerena Cobbina & Maia DaviesPool/Getty ImagesBarron Trump, the president's fifth child, said he met the alleged victim on social mediaDonald Trump's youngest son contacted UK police saying he witnessed a friend in London being \"beat up\" during a video call, a court has heard.Barron Trump, 19, told police he had friends call 999 from the US so that he could report the alleged attack in January 2025.Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, is on trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court accused of assault and two counts of rape, among other charges, against the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasonsHe denies assault, actual bodily harm, two counts of rape, intentional strangulation and perverting the course of justice by pressuring the woman to withdraw her complaints.Trump called the alleged victim on 18 January last year, the court heard.Shortly after placing the call, the US president's fifth child contacted the police and said she was being assaulted.\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" he said, according to a transcript of the call released by the Crown Prosecution Service.\"This was happening about eight minutes ago. I just figured out how to, how to call someone. Uh, uh it's really an emergency.\"When asked by the operator how he knows the woman, he said: \"I don't think these details matter, she's getting beat up but OK fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\" The operator responded: \"Can you stop being rude and actually answer my questions?\"Trump was later asked by police to provide a witness statement and said in an email on 2 May that what he saw had been \"very brief indeed but indeed prevalent\".He said he had not expected that his call to the woman would be answered because of the time difference, but it was picked up by \"a shirtless man with darkish hair\".\"This view lasted maybe one second\", he said, adding the view then flipped to the victim getting hit while crying.\"This whole interaction had lasted five to seven seconds.\"He continued: \"I made two of my friends call the Met Police in the UK, even though they are in the US.\"As per evidence I do not have any, I was told by the victim who I am very close with that this individual was giving her difficulty for a long time.\"Rumiantsev denies the charges, which date between November 2024 and January 2025. Prosecutors allege Rumiantsev strangled the woman the evening of 17 January last year.She later called the police, and the Russian national was arrested on the morning of 18 January and taken into custody.The defendant told jurors that the two had been drinking together that night and into the early morning, and had consensual sex during that time.Giving evidence on Thursday, Rumiantsev said an argument broke out and that the woman was \"completely hysterical, crying, screaming, shouting at me\".He said he had held her arms in self-defence to prevent her from hitting him.\"I noticed her phone next to me on the sofa and it was ringing with a Barron Trump face call,\" the defendant told the court.He said he was not sure why he answered the call, but that maybe he hoped \"that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else.\" Earlier, the Russian national told the court that he learned about the woman's friendship with Trump in October 2024 - when she asked him to take a photograph of a chat between them on her phone. The court also heard he and the alleged victim had had a disagreement in November 2024.Rumiantsev said that he had felt \"upset\" about her talking to Trump.But he said: \"I was in no way controlling but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else.\"The trial continues.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentA UK government minister has said he is \"angry\" he was not kept fully informed about issues which resulted in the British Army's Ajax armoured vehicle programme being paused.The Ministry of Defence said it had paused its decision-making on the future of the programme while further investigations took place, after 35 service personnel across 23 vehicles became ill with reports of some vomiting and shaking following training last year.Defence Minister Luke Pollard said he had initially been told the vehicle was \"demonstrably safe\".He said he had already taken a number of steps, including replacing the senior team leader responsible for the troubled project.Some of the soldiers emerging from the vehicles were said to have been sick due to the vehicle noise and vibration while others were shaking after the military exercise on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, in November, according to The Times.At the time, an MoD spokesperson said: \"This weekend, a small number of soldiers reported symptoms of noise and vibration, having taken part in an exercise involving the Ajax armoured fighting vehicle.\"Most of those service personnel affected have now returned to duty, but Pollard told MPs on Thursday he was angry he had not been given all the information, and said the programme had been put on pause while further investigations took place.In a written ministerial statement issued earlier, Pollard said: \"To say that I am angry about the findings of the ministerial review is an understatement. \"It demonstrates that people were raising issues with this programme, but they were not being elevated to an appropriate level.\"In November, Pollard, announced that Ajax had reached its \"initial operating capability\" - a significant milestone. The multi-million pound vehicles, made in Merthyr Tydfil by General Dynamics, were originally due to enter service in 2019.But the £6.3bn project has been criticised for being poorly managed by the Ministry of Defence and was paused in June 2021 due to concerns over vibration and noise causing hearing loss to those training.In December, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens told the BBC the most important thing was to \"make sure that equipment that's being supplied is safe\".Trials on Ajax are set to resume soon, before a final decision is made on its future. The British Army has ordered 589 Ajax armoured vehicles at a cost of more than £5bn. The programme is already eight years behind schedule. Conservative shadow defence minister Mark Francois said that \"as the safety of our soldiers remains paramount, ministers must now, finally, absolutely, fix Ajax or fail it - once and for all\".He said Pollard's ministerial statement was \"one of the most extraordinary\" he had ever seen. \"In it, Luke Pollard, rightfully admits his anger that submissions did not reflect the full breadth of the known aggregated safety risk.\"He said it also appeared the Ajax senior responsible officer \"has now, effectively, been sacked from his up to £160k a year job and that trials will now tentatively restart\".

    "body": "2 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorGetty ImagesA marble sits at the top of a very long, elaborate and twisting run right now.If - and it's a big if - it trundles all the way to the bottom, Andy Burnham might become prime minister.But hang on a minute, let's not get ahead of ourselves.That marble might not even set off down the run, or might fly off spectacularly halfway down.The twists, turns and obstacles standing between the Greater Manchester mayor and a return to Westminster as an MP – a prerequisite for him to challenge Sir Keir Starmer for the Labour leadership – are substantial.Firstly, Burnham has to decide if he wants to go for it. On the upside for him, this is a contest close to home, in Greater Manchester. It is also a contest triggered by the departure of an MP on medical grounds. It would be hard for his critics to suggest Andrew Gwynne stepping down is part of an elaborate political plot.But, if Burnham does say he wants to run, he has to ask the Labour Party's National Executive Committee for permission.This body, the party's rule book sets out, must give its \"express permission\" before directly-elected mayors can seek nomination as Labour candidates for elections to the Westminster Parliament. So the party could turn around and say no – on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive and potentially politically tricky. Plus, frankly, there are those within Labour who would rather he didn't come back to Westminster, such has been, as they see it, the gratuitous nature of his manoeuvring for the top job. But it is also true that plenty within the Labour movement think he could be something of a saviour for a party and a government that are really struggling.If Burnham is rejected - the marble flying off the run - what does he do next? He has a big enough stage, megaphone and profile to do the prime minister real damage, should he choose to do so.And what happens if he does stand? The by-election would attract vast attention.Andrew Gwynne won the Gorton and Denton seat comfortably at the last general election, but Labour's popularity has nosedived since.'No means a certainty'Reform UK and the Green Party finished second and third respectively, and many suspect they could both be much more competitive this time.Reform's leader Nigel Farage was quick to relish what lies ahead.\"This by-election is by no means a certainty for Labour, the left-wing Greens will split their vote, and we will be the challenger. We will give it our all,\" he said.It is far from certain, even in this scenario where Andy Burnham is the Labour candidate, that he makes it back to Westminster.But it is also true this might be his one chance to return to Westminster, in a seat in his patch, with a vulnerable prime minister and plenty of chat among Labour MPs about who might replace him.So finally, let's imagine he is Labour's candidate and he wins. It is entirely possible he would do so just as Labour did badly in elections in Scotland and Wales, and the local elections in many parts of England in May.And so he would arrive on those green benches in the Commons at just the point many Labour folk anticipate the prime minister reaches his stickiest moment yet. Is this the point he is a challenger for the Labour leadership, alongside others?As I say, this marble run is long and twisting. But it could become the political spectator sport of the spring. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentThe government is to radically reduce the number of police forces in England and Wales as part of what sources have called the largest reform of policing in decades.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will announce plans for police reform next week.She will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime. Police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega forces\" to save money and boost crime-fighting efforts.It could be years before changes are implemented, with government sources saying only that it will happen by the end of the next parliament, around 2034.Mahmood will argue in a policy proposal that the current model of 43 forces is bureaucratic and wastes money, with each force running their own headquarters, management teams and backroom staff.Ministers also believe the performance of local forces varies too widely across England. They believe smaller forces are less well equipped to deal with serious crime and respond to major incidents.Mahmood is expected to say new, larger forces should focus on tackling serious and organised crime, as well as complex cases like murder and drugs.Ministers will also announce plans for new Local Policing Areas, with local officers focusing on neighbourhood policing.It is proposed these will be set up in every borough, town or city across in England, and will be tasked with working with communities and fighting what the government calls \"local crime\", such as shoplifting, phone theft and drug dealing.Government insiders acknowledge there is an \"epidemic of every day offences\" going unpunished, and say they believe criminals think they can \"cause havoc on our streets with impunity\" because people are forced to wait hours or days for police to investigate crimes.A government source said: \"Where you live will no longer determine the outcomes you get from your force.\"Ministers will not say next week exactly how many forces will exist under the new framework. Instead, an independent review will be announced to looking at precise details.Similar cuts have been proposed as long as 20 years ago, when then Home Secretary Charles Clarke suggested cutting the number of forces to 12.Scotland also merged its forces in 2013 to create Police Scotland.The home secretary's allies will sell these reforms as part of her \"modernising agenda\".A source said: \"For decades, people have called for forces to be merged. Mahmood is a politician who is not scared of bold reform and a political fight.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"Keir Starmer's forced police reorganisation will undermine efforts to flight crime across England and Wales, inevitably leading to centralised control and reduced policing in towns and villages across the country.\"Some police chiefs have called for a revamp of policing in England and have backed reducing the number of forces.Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said: \"Crime is changing, technology is evolving, and we need to be set up in the best possible way to tackle crime in the modern world, relentlessly focused on good quality neighbourhood policing alongside national threats.\"I know the home secretary shares this ambition. We look forward to seeing the government's white paper and working with them to ensure policing delivers outstanding results and rebuilds confidence with the communities we serve.\"A spokesman for the Policing Federation, which represents officers from the rank of constable to chief inspector, said: \"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. \"Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"Any proposals must be driven by evidence and best practice, not lowest cost, and must strengthen rather than weaken frontline, investigative and specialist capability, neighbourhood policing and public confidence.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterPresident Donald Trump has filed a $5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit against America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase, accusing it of illegally closing his accounts for political reasons. The lawsuit, which also names the bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon, alleges that Trump and his businesses suffered \"considerable financial and reputational harm\" after the bank abruptly closed their accounts in 2021.The bank moved to close the accounts after the 6 January, 2021 riot when Trump supporters descended on the US Capitol to disrupt formal ratification of the election results. A JPMorgan Chase spokesperson said \"the suit has no merit\".\"  \"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons.\" \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company,\" the bank added in a statement.The lawsuit, which Trump said was coming over the weekend, is the latest clash between Trump and Dimon, who has led JPMorgan for two decades.In recent weeks, Dimon has also spoken out against the administration's proposal to cap credit cards and criticised its immigration policy and posture toward the Federal Reserve.The complaint was filed in Florida, which bars banks from discriminating against clients for their political views.In the lawsuit, a copy of which was obtained by the BBC's US news partner CBS, Trump says JPMorgan's decision to close his accounts was a \"key indicator of a systemic, subversive industry practice that aims to coerce the public to shift and re-align their political views\".The filing alleges that the move was driven by \"unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views\".\"In essence, JPMC debanked plaintiffs' accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,\" it says. Trump also accused the bank of trade libel over its decision to place his name, and that of his businesses \"and/or family\" on a \"blacklist\" - a roster that was shared with other banks and intended to identify people with a history of \"malfeasant\" activity.That move was allegedly approved by Dimon himself. In the aftermath of the Capitol riot, a number of companies had shunned doing business with the president. In its statement on Thursday, JPMorgan said it regretted having to close accounts, but said it was \"rules and regulatory expectations\" that often prompted the decisions.\"We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponisation of the banking sector,\" it said.Debanking, or the process of closing accounts, has been a priority issue for Trump, who has publicly taken JPMorgan and other banks to task for the practice and ordered a review of their activities. Last month, regulators said they had found nine of the country's biggest banks made \"inappropriate distinctions\" among customers based on their business activities, with sectors such as oil and gas, private prisons and adult entertainment facing restricted access.",

    "body": "France says it has seized an oil tanker in the Mediterranean suspected of being part of Russia's sanction-busting \"shadow fleet\".French President Emmanuel Macron said the tanker, named the Grinch, was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The French navy, with the assistance of allies including the UK, boarded the vessel on Thursday morning between Spain and Morocco. French maritime authorities said that a search of the vessel had \"confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag\".Russia's embassy in Paris said it had not been informed of the seizure.Moscow's so-called shadow fleet is a clandestine network of tankers used to evade Western sanctions on Russian oil exports by shipping the oil on aged tankers with obscure ownership or insurance.The Grinch was travelling from the Arctic port of Murmansk in northern Russia when it was intercepted, French authorities said. The vessel had been flying a Comoros flag, according to ship tracking websites marinetraffic and vesselfinder.Announcing the seizure on X, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"The activities of the \"shadow fleet\" contribute to financing the war of aggression against Ukraine,\" he said, adding that the vessel had been \"diverted\".Defence Secretary John Healy said the UK navy had provided \"tracking and monitoring\" support, with HMS Dagger monitoring the tanker through the Straits of Gibraltar.He added: \"Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels to choke off the funds that fuel Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine.\"The UK has imposed sanctions on 544 Russian shadow fleet vessels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the action, saying it was \"exactly the kind of resolve needed to ensure that Russian oil no longer finances Russia's war\".\"Vessels must be apprehended. And wouldn't it be fair to confiscate and sell the oil carried by these tankers?\" he said on X.Speaking at Davos earlier, Zelensky exhorted Europe to do more to ensure its own security, saying: \"Europe loves to discuss the future but avoids taking action\".Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia. Moscow denounced the move, saying no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.

    "body": "'It's all about the land': Zelensky says Ukraine to talk to US and Russia8 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorEPAPresident Volodymyr Zelensky says trilateral talks on ending the war in Ukraine are to take place with Russia and the US in the United Arab Emirates, after he met  President Donald Trump in Davos.As the diplomatic pace appeared to intensify, Trump said his meeting with Zelensky was good, and US envoy Steve Witkoff headed to Moscow for talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin.Witkoff, who was travelling to Moscow with Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said he was optimistic about a deal.\"I think we've got it down to one issue and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it's solvable,\" he said before leaving the Swiss resort.Trump's envoy gave no details about the remaining sticking point, but Zelensky later clarified that the future status of eastern Ukraine remained the unsolved issue.He made clear that the planned talks in the Emirates would involve Russia as well as the US and Ukraine, adding that \"the Russians have to be ready for compromises, not only Ukraine\".\"It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet,\" Zelensky told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland - adding that trilateral talks might provide the two sides with \"variants\".The US proposal for Ukraine's industrial heartland in Donbas is for a demilitarised and free economic zone in exchange for security guarantees for Kyiv.\"If both sides want to solve this, we're going to get it solved,\" Witkoff said, explaining that he would be heading to Abu Dhabi after Moscow, where working groups would be covering military issues as well as economic prosperity.Zelensky also told reporters that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal. He gave no details but said it would need to go before the US Congress and Ukrainian parliament before signing.Although he said the \"Coalition of the Willing\", led by the UK and France, had committed forces on the ground to monitor the deal, he was adamant a Trump backstop would be necessary too: \"No security guarantees work without the US.\"Earlier he used his Davos speech to criticise his European allies for a lack of \"political will\" to take action against Russia.\"There are endless internal arguments and things left unsaid that stop Europe from uniting and speaking honestly enough to find real solutions,\" he said, drawing a contrast with the US under Trump.\"President Trump loves who he is, and he says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe,\" he said.The Ukrainian president had travelled through the night to get to Davos.He had initially called off his trip to deal with the aftermath of Russian strikes on Kyiv's power infrastructure, which have left large areas of the capital without heating, water or power during the harshest winter so far in almost four years of Russia's full-scale war. Thousands of apartment blocks remain without heating.Zelensky said last month that a 20-point US plan to end the war was 90% ready and that Ukraine's position on Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, was different to Russia's.As part of the US 20-point plan, Zelensky has offered to withdraw troops by up to 40km (25 miles) from the 25% of the Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls in order to create an economic zone in Donbas, if Russia does the same. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that discussions with the American envoys would continue \"on the Ukrainian issue and other related topics\" and refused to say whether he shared Witkoff's optimism on achieving a deal.Putin is known to covet control of the entire region, and Russian forces have advanced slowly in the east in the past year.Another big sticking point that Zelensky highlighted last month was future control of Ukraine's enormous Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, seized by Russia in March 2022.Zelensky joked that he hoped the Emirates knew about the planned meeting, but in a measure of the seriousness of the talks he named some his most senior officials in the Ukrainian team taking part.The head of the country's national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov, was already talking to US officials in Davos, along with Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Zelensky's office, and negotiator David Arakhamia. They will be joined the chief of the general staff, Andrii Hnatov.",

    "body": "Met Office weather warnings - including a more severe amber warning - have been issued for rain in parts of the UK.Heavy rain in eastern Scotland, Northern Ireland and parts of England and Wales will bring significant rainfall totals and the risk of flooding.Strong winds will accompany the rain, particularly in north-east Scotland.Into Friday, Storm Ingrid - named by the Portuguese weather service - will bring rain and strong winds into south-western areas of England and Wales with further warnings issued here.Heavy rain and strong winds have continued in eastern Scotland, where there is a Met Office amber warning in force for Grampian, Angus, and Perth and Kinross until 18:00 GMT.Rainfall accumulations of 60-80mm are likely, with as much as 100-120mm over high ground. Totals since Wednesday evening may exceed 150 mm in a few places. This is expected to lead to some surface water and river flooding across the area.There is also a wider yellow warning across the rest of eastern Scotland where rainfall accumulations of 30-60mm will be seen widely.The Met Office warns that with the ground already saturated from recent rain and and snow thaw, this may lead to some flooding in places.A strong south-easterly wind in north-east Scotland will also make it feel particularly unpleasant.Additional yellow warnings are in force on Thursday across south-east Wales, Somerset and Devon from 08:00 to 16:00 and Northern Ireland from 10:00 to 23:59.Persistent and heavy rain in these areas through the day falling on saturated ground could lead to some flooding and transport disruption.On Thursday morning there were nearly 160 flood warnings in force across England, Scotland and Wales.Weather warningsFlood warningsElsewhere, the weather remains generally cloudy and breezy, with rain and drizzle.On Friday, the UK will be impacted by Storm Ingrid, which was named by the Portuguese weather service due to the impacts expected there from strong winds and heavy rain.The centre of Ingrid will move close to the south-west of England and north-west France. Winds in the UK will strengthen on Friday, with gusts up to 60mph expected in south-west England and Wales along with further heavy rain at times.A Met Office yellow warning will come into force here from 02:00 GMT Friday to 09:00 Saturday.While the winds won't be as powerful or dangerous as the near 100mph winds experienced in south-west England during Storm Goretti, there could still be some impacts.With saturated ground, flooding is possible and, with coastal gales, there will be large overtopping waves.It will likely stay windy through Saturday morning as the centre of Ingrid stalls to the south-west. Winds will gradually ease as the day progresses.The rest of the UK will avoid any impacts associated with Storm Ingrid, but the rain in eastern Scotland will continue, with some snow over higher ground.While Storm Ingrid will affect south-western parts of England, for the rest of the UK, we will start to see a brisk south-east to easterly wind.Drawing in colder air from north-east Europe, temperatures will start to drop over the weekend and next week with a cold snap.By Monday, temperatures will fall to 4 to 6C below the average for the end of January.The easterly wind will also likely bring occasional wintry showers, with snow for some parts of the UK.Where exactly, and how much snow, is not yet certain, but wintry hazards are likely.",

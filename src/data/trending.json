Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "14 hours agoPAAnya Taylor-Joy and her husband were staying in a London mansion at the time of the break inAn armed robber who tried to prise open the bedroom door of Hollywood actress Anya Taylor-Joy while she was staying at a London mansion has been jailed.Kirk Holdrick, 43, was one of two masked men who smashed their way into the luxury property, in what may have been a targeted raid, Wood Green Crown Court heard.In November, Holdrick was jailed for 12 years for a robbery in Dorset where a mother and daughter were tied up and threatened with violence. He was handed a further three-year custodial sentence after admitting burglary of the London home.Holdrick, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, was described in court as a career criminal with convictions dating back to his teenage years.Taylor-Joy and her husband, Malcolm McRae, were staying at the London property on 12 February 2023 when they heard the glass of a side window being smashed.McRae confronted the intruders before barricading himself and his wife inside a bedroom, which they then tried to prise into. Armed only with a lamp, he managed to scare off the men by bluffing that he had a gun, causing them to flee the scene empty-handed.Prosecutors suggested that because the burglars did not simply steal expensive items and implied they had intended to target the celebrities personally.The couple told police they had been traumatised by the ordeal and feared being targeted again.The Golden Globe winner known for The Queen's Gambit, the Dune films and Peaky Blinders, appeared on the Baftas red carpet just a week after the ordeal.Holdrick was arrested on 18 April 2023 after stepping off a ferry from Belfast to Liverpool. He claimed he had been to the property previously as a guest at a party and suggested that was how his DNA had been left behind. He later abandoned this defence and pleaded guilty to burglary in mid-December last year.PA MediaHoldrick, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, was described at Wood Green Crown Court as a career criminalNine days after the break-in at the London mansion, Holdrick took part in a robbery in which a mother and daughter were held at gunpoint, tied up and threatened with violence.Holdrick and his accomplice, Ashley Fulton, disguised themselves as police officers during the break-in at a property in Sandbanks, overlooking Poole Harbour, Dorset where they targeted the home of wealthy businessman Mark Aitchison.Aitchison's wife, Kerry, was told she would be killed if she did not open the family safe. When their daughter Emily arrived home unexpectedly, she was also restrained and threatened.The intruders told her they would shoot her in front of her mother and demanded to know where the iron was, saying: \"We want to burn you.\"The pair escaped with £200,000 worth of luxury watches, designer handbags, jewellery and cash, but left a trail of DNA behind. Police traced the getaway car and recovered vapes from the vehicle.Holdrick, who previously briefly dated one of the cast members from The Only Way Is Essex, was jailed for life in 2005 for armed robberies on a security van.He was recalled to prison to continue serving his life sentence after his latest offences.In November, he was jailed for 12 years for the Sandbanks robbery and a further four years on licence if he is released, after pleading guilty at Bournemouth Crown Court to two counts of robbery, possession of an imitation firearm and fraud.Related to this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "7 hours agoMadeline HalpertNew Castle County PoliceFormer US First Lady Jill Biden's ex-husband William Stevenson has been charged with murdering his current wife, Linda Stevenson, officials said. William Stevenson, 77, faces first-degree murder charges over the death of his wife Linda, 64, following a weeks-long investigation, New Castle County Police in Delaware said in a statement on Monday.Stevenson is being held at a facility in Wilmington, Delaware, after failing to post $500,000 (£365,000) in bail, police said. On 28 December 2025, police responded to a report of a domestic dispute at the Stevensons' home, where they found Linda Stevenson unresponsive in the living room, officials said in earlier statements. Police said they attempted life-saving measures that failed. They said they were conducting an autopsy to determine the cause of death. The BBC has contacted former First Lady Jill Biden and former President Joe Biden for comment. Biden was married to Stevenson, a former college football player from 1970 to 1975. They wed when Biden was 18 and Stevenson was 23. Stevenson is a businessman and owns the Stone Balloon college bar near the University of Delaware. Jill Biden met Joe Biden in March 1975 and married in 1977. An obituary for Linda Stevenson said she was survived by her daughter, granddaughter, and sister. \"Linda was deeply family-oriented and treasured time spent making memories, especially on family vacations with her daughter and granddaughter,\" the obituary said.

In 2015, he was given a death sentence in absentia by a Libyan court for his role in the crackdown.He shaped policy and led high-profile negotiations despite having no official role in government, including those which led his father to abandon his nuclear weapons programme.Such agreements saw international sanctions on the north African country lifted, and some considered Gaddafi a reformist and acceptable face of a changing Libya.Gaddafi had always denied that he wanted to inherit power from his father, saying the reins of power were \"not a farm to inherit\".However, in 2021 he announced he would run for the presidency in elections which were then postponed indefinitely.",

The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.Her lawyer, Brad Edwards, has previously told BBC News: \"We're talking about at least one woman who was sent by Jeffrey Epstein over to Prince Andrew.\"The BBC asked Mountbatten-Windsor for comment about the allegations when it was first reported, but he is yet to respond, and has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was \"aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes.\"We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.\"The statement added: \"We take any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward.\"At this time, these allegations have not been reported to Thames Valley Police by either the lawyer or their client.\"The anti-monarchist campaign group Republic earlier said it had reported Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to the police over allegations that \"he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to the UK for sex\".Edwards, whose US law firm has been representing Epstein victims since 2008, said that after spending the night with Mountbatten-Windsor, the woman says she was given tea and a tour of Buckingham Palace.The Palace routinely records the names of tour guests, but it has not been possible for the BBC to corroborate the woman's visit without revealing her identity.Her account of spending the night at Royal Lodge is the first time an Epstein survivor has alleged a sexual encounter occurred at a royal residence.In 2014, the late Virginia Giuffre became the first woman to publicly accuse Mountbatten-Windsor of similar encounters.She alleged that as a 17-year-old she was trafficked by Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor - a claim he continues to deny.Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against him in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing criticism over his relationship with Epstein after the latest tranche of files related to the late sex offender.The documents released on Friday included pictures of him kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him. A number of exchanges between Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor came in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlicia CurryWorld Governments SummitPrince Edward is in Dubai at the World Governments SummitThe Duke of Edinburgh has said it is \"really important\" to remember Jeffrey Epstein's victims as his brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, faces growing pressure to give evidence over what he knows about the late sex offender.The comments are the first from a senior royal since Andrew was pictured in the latest tranche of documents relating to Epstein. The images appear to show Andrew kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground. Both are fully clothed. Other files repeatedly reference him and his former wife, Sarah Ferguson. Being mentioned in the documents is not an indication of any wrongdoing.Prince Edward made the comments at the World Governments Summit in Dubai after being asked by a CNN journalist how he was \"coping\" with the fallout from the files.The duke, who is the youngest of King Charles' siblings, replied: \"Well, with the best will in the world, I'm not sure this is the audience that is the least bit interested in that.\"They all came here to listen to education, solving the future, but no, I think it's all really important, always, to remember the victims and who are the victims in all this.\"US Department of JusticeAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor in an image from the documents relating to EpsteinAndrew, formerly known as Prince Andrew and the Duke of York, was stripped of his royal titles in October.This came after increasing scrutiny over Andrew's links to Epstein and the posthumous publication of a book by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17-years-old - a claim which Andrew has denied.Andrew - who has always denied any wrongdoing - reached a settlement with Giuffre in 2022, paying her an undisclosed sum.The encounter allegedly occurred at the former prince's residence, Royal Lodge, in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.BBC News has asked Andrew for comment, but he has so far not responded to these accusations.Emails released on Friday showed a number of exchanges between Epstein and Andrew in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.Andrew appeared to invite Epstein to Buckingham Palace in one of the messages.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Another detailed an offer from Epstein to introduce Andrew to a 26-year-old Russian woman.The files also show there have been multiple unsuccessful approaches from US authorities for Andrew to help with Epstein inquiries.Calls are now growing for Andrew to give evidence in the US, of what he knows about Epstein.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been amongst those calling for him to testify, and told reporters over the weekend that \"anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information\".\"You can't be victim-centred if you're not prepared to do that,\" he said. \"Epstein's victims have to be the first priority.\"Echoing the prime minister's position, a royal source told the BBC that \"anyone who has information should consider helping any investigation\".\"But that is ultimately a matter for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and his conscience,\" the source added.",

    "body": "7 hours agoBranwen JeffreysEducation EditorBranwen Jeffreys / BBCUniversity of Sussex vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil (left) appeared outside the High Court with university colleagues The University of Sussex has started its High Court legal challenge against a record £585,000 fine for failing to uphold freedom of speech. It claims the higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), acted beyond its legal powers to impose the fine, and put too much weight on a trans and non-binary equality policy in place at the time. The university had been caught up in controversy after Dr Kathleen Stock, a former academic at the university, resigned from her post as a professor following protests against her views on sex and gender issues. The Office for Students will defend its \"careful and detailed\" investigation of the university in front of a judge this week.When it handed down the fine, the OfS said its investigation had found the university's policy had a \"chilling effect\" on free speech, which may have led staff and students to censor themselves on campus.As the regulator for all higher education providers in England, the outcome of the challenge against the OfS will have far-reaching implications for its ability to enforce freedom of speech and academic freedom at universities.Opening the case for the university, Chris Buttler KC said Sussex had a proud tradition of fostering free speech. He said the fine had \"severe\" consequences for the university's reputation as a \"bastion of free speech\".When Stock resigned in October 2021, after students protested against her view that biological sex is more important than gender identity, it appeared to mark the end of a high-profile row. Now, decisions made by the regulator in a subsequent investigation, which lasted three-and-a-half years and led up to the fine, will be under scrutiny in the High Court.Much of the legal argument centres around the university's former trans and non-binary equality policy.The university has argued this two-page policy was not a \"governing document\", so the regulator had no right to rule on it. Court submissions by the lawyers for Sussex also claim there was potential bias in the investigation into the university, because of a pre-existing friendship between Dr Arif Ahmed, director for freedom of speech at the OfS, and Stock. The university claims that before he took up the post, Ahmed had written publicly in support of Stock's views, and sent emails of warm encouragement privately. Stock was the only witness interviewed during the investigation, the university claimed. Getty ImagesThe OfS fined the University of Sussex for failing to uphold free speech on campusSussex said its requests for meetings were turned down, and that testimony was not gathered from students or the students' union. The OfS is scheduled to begin its defence on Tuesday, and is expected to say its role in safeguarding the \"fundamental values\" of freedom of speech and academic freedom is at the heart of the case.While the trans and non-binary policy went through several versions, the regulator is expected to argue the university failed to follow its own procedures for how it adopted what it describes as \"governing documents\".The OfS has said in its submissions to court that it offered Sussex a chance to meet to discuss a settlement as early as October 2022, provided the university accepted it had breached regulations.It also refutes any suggestion of bias, saying Ahmed had a \"limited professional acquaintance\" with Stock.The OfS rejects claims that it has singled out the University of Sussex for punishment.The hearings are due to last three days before Mrs Justice Lieven, with a judgment likely to be delivered at a later date.",

    "body": "5 hours agoHarry LowHouse of CommonsBBCKatalin Kaszas says Mark Hehir helped her in a \"very, very scary\" situationA woman whose necklace was stolen by a bus passenger who was then knocked unconscious by the driver has said she is \"extremely grateful\" to him for intervening in what was a \"terrifying\" situation.Katalin Kaszas spoke to BBC London at Parliament earlier on Tuesday, where the driver Mark Hehir - who went on to be sacked over the June 2024 incident - had been invited by shadow justice minister Dr Kieran Mullan.Kaszas described how the thief snatched her necklace as she boarded the 206 bus in north-west London.Hehir, who left the bus to chase the thief, has previously explained that he struck him in an act of self-defence after the thief tried to hit him.'I was screaming'Hehir was dismissed by his employer, Metroline, for gross misconduct, a decision that went on to be upheld at an employment tribunal.Kaszas, who explained how the events unfolded, said she had initially thought the passenger was about to push her off the bus.The 46-year-old said she \"didn't even realise\" her necklace had been snatched from her neck until she looked down.\"Your brain doesn't catch up that quick. You're still trying to understand what's happened,\" Kaszas said.PA MediaKaszas says she is extremely grateful to Hehir, who now works as a barmanShe said after Hehir chased the thief and returned with her necklace, the man then came back towards her.\"I was screaming, telling him to stay away from me,\" Kaszas said, adding: \"His face was bad news. It was very, very scary at that point.\"Kaszas described how Hehir then stepped between her and the man. \"He kept the guy back,\" she said.She added: \"I'm a single mum. I'm the only one my daughter has. If something happens to me, it happens to her.\"He made me feel safe and since there is no Mark on the buses, I don't feel that safe any more because I know the next driver isn't going to step off the bus to protect me because he's going to lose his job.\"PA MediaKieran Mullan (left) introduced Hehir to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch in ParliamentCCTV evidence played at the tribunal showed the thief throwing a punch at Hehir.\"I noticed him making a left swing, so on instinct I retaliated with a right,\" the 62-year-old said.Both Hehir and the passenger were arrested over the altercation, which happened between Wembley and Maida Vale.Hehir, who is originally from County Limerick and now lives in Wembley, was later released and told he would not face further police action.The day after the incident, on 25 June 2024, Hehir was suspended from duty and told to attend an investigation. He was later dismissed. The subsequent employment tribunal heard from the Met Police, which said Hehir's response had been \"proportionate and necessary in the circumstances\".A Metroline spokesperson said: \"The Independent Employment Tribunal has upheld the dismissal as fair. \"The claimant breached protocols designed to keep staff and passengers safe, which is our priority.\"An online petition calling on Metroline to reverse its decision or compensate Hehir has received more than 125,000 signaturesMullan said he was \"shocked\" that Hehir ended up being sacked for \"stepping in\" to prevent a theft. \"That's not good for our society,\" he told BBC London. Justice Secretary David Lammy told the House of Commons on Tuesday that Hehir \"is of course a hero and deserves our support\".He added: \"I'm following this case very closely.\"As for Kaszas, who is from Neasden in north-west London, she said she felt guilty about what happened and had repeatedly apologised to Hehir following the tribunal ruling.\"I know it's not my fault,\" she said, \"but I still feel guilty because I'm in the middle of everything.\"More on this story",

    "body": "Earlier cancer diagnosis and faster treatment, government promises2 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesEarlier diagnosis and faster access to treatment is a core part of the government's plan (generic photo)Earlier cancer diagnosis and faster treatment are being promised under a government plan in England to ensure three quarters of patients are surviving cancer for at least five years by 2035.Ministers say the ambition being outlined in their cancer strategy on Wednesday will herald the fastest improvement in cancer outcomes this century.Latest data for 2022 shows five-year survival at 60%, leaving the UK lagging behind other developed countries.To help achieve the goal, the government will pledge to hit the 62-day waiting time target by 2029 - it is more than a decade since it was met.But experts warn it will require significant extra investment, particularly in staff, to make improvement.However, Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who has survived kidney cancer, is adamant the plans are achievable.He said the investment being made in the NHS by the government – the budget is increasing by 3% above inflation in the coming years – coupled with advances in medical science and technology will help \"transform the life chances of cancer patients\".Speaking ahead of publishing the strategy on Wednesday, Streeting added: \"Cancer is more likely to be a death sentence in Britain than other countries around the world. But survival shouldn't come down to who won the lottery of life.\"As a cancer survivor who owes my life to the NHS, I owe it to future patient to make sure they receive the same outstanding care I did.\"Early diagnosis keyImproving early diagnosis is seen as crucial – currently just over half of cancers are diagnosed at stages one and two, which provides the best opportunity to treat the disease. The proportion has improved little in the past decade.Steps to identify more cancers through screening will be outlined – currently only 6% of cases are.The government has already said it will lower the threshold at which bowel cancer screening triggers further checks to help identify more cancers.A targeted lung cancer screening programme is also being rolled out for ex-smokers.The plan is expected to:Deliver 9.5 million more tests and scans by 2029Rapidly increase the amount of precision robotic surgery being carried outTreat more rare cancers, such as brain cancer, in specialist centres in a bid to improve outcomesExpand genetic testing so more patients benefit from targeted treatment, such as immunotherapy, for their specific type of cancerThe pledge to hit the 62-day waiting time target is being seen as particularly challenging. Currently around 70% of patients start their treatment with this timescale, but the target is 85%.There are another two targets that form part of that – a 28-day target for diagnosis, which is being met, and a 31-day target for treatment to start, which is being missed.Staffing shortagesThe Royal College of Radiologists said there were insufficient specialist cancer staff to meet demand.Workforce surveys suggest there is a 30% shortfall in radiologists and 15% in clinical oncologists - doctors that oversee non-surgical cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\"Plans to diagnose and treat cancer faster are welcome, but without sustained investment in the specialist workforce, there will not be enough doctors to deliver timely and effective care for patients,\" added college president Dr Stephen Harden.Cancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell said the promises represented a \"significant commitment\" that would require a \"wide range of measures\".\"England lags behind comparable countries on cancer survival – it's vital that changes,\" she said.Five-year survival data analysed by the charity shows the UK consistently lags behind on cancers of the stomach, colon, pancreas, ovaries and lungs.For example, on colon cancer five-year survival exceeds 70% in Australia, while in the UK it is under 60%.For lung cancer, 15% of UK cases live five years, but in Norway and Canadamore than 20% do.Gemma Peters, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \"People living with cancer tall us all too often that their care hasn't been good enough, from long waits for tests and treatment to being left without the support they need once treatment ends.\"She said it was encouraging to see such \"bold ambitions\" which had the potential to transform care.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "10 hours agoSean Coughlan,Royal correspondentandLauren Turner,Culture reporterGetty ImagesSarah Ferguson's image was once about her good-humoured ability to bounce back from misfortunes and embarrassment, but the latest Epstein emails appear to cast her in a different light.She comes across as a needy figure, chasing money and support, more desperate than duchess - apparently describing herself to Epstein as \"very traumatised and alone\", and seeming to suggest she could be employed to \"organise your houses\".But there are also glimpses of a life of privilege, as the same email mentions she's in the south of France with the \"perfect butler\".The BBC has contacted Ferguson for comment on the latest release. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.The messages between Ferguson and Epstein almost seem like he's talking about someone on his payroll, such as asking her to show business contacts round Buckingham Palace - and her daughters get included too.In a message to \"Ferg\" in March 2010, Epstein writes: \"Thank you Sarah, could you are (sic) one of your daughters show (redacted) buckingham thanks.\"An apparent reply from \"Sarah\" reads: \"Of course.\"That July, referring to a separate occasion, she apparently writes to Epstein apologising that \"the girls were not around this weekend\". \"Shows I don't crack the whip when I am not in the country!,\" the message continues. \"Actually eugie was in france and beatrice was out with dave.\"Epstein also messages to say a friend will be in London, adding: \"Any chance of your daughters saying hello.\"As more emails emerge, there's a growing impression of how much Ferguson seemed to depend on Epstein, telling him he was her \"pillar\" and confiding \"I have been so so sad\".Some of the emails date from when Epstein was still serving a sentence for soliciting sex from a minor, according to the documents. He was released from prison on 22 July 2009 after serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence. There are emails in the files from that June and earlier in the July from \"Sarah\". An email from August the following year reads: \"I am feeling very traumatised and alone. I am wanting to work for you at organising your houses.\" The next month she appears to ask \"when are you going to employ me\", and the same day \"phew.. you still love me\".In another exchange in 2009, she jokes with Epstein about another woman: \"You can marry her too. She is single and a great body.\"Referring to her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Ferguson writes later in 2010: \"So you have not forgotten about me. I do know that my handsome Prince is a saint.. And you worship him, I do too. \"But then I did marry him. And still love him.\"Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently and strenuously always denied any wrongdoing and his office has been contacted for comment on the release of the files.There are also messages behind her back between Epstein and his associates: \"Getting financials for fergie is painful. Incredible mess. I'm on it but for sure completeness will always remain questionable.\"She appears to tell Epstein that \"the British press is ready to exterminate me\" and that the Palace is \"not equipped to deal with all of this huge wave of negativity\". \"I am now 1000 percent being hung out to dry, just as I predicted you will see, the Press will have me exiled,\" the email continues. \"I am totally on my own now. This is beyond scandalous and nobody can do anything. I cannot believe what this is all coming to.\"She adds that \"no woman has ever left the Royal Family with her head, and (they) cannot behead me, therefore they will discredit me. Totally to obliteration\". This latest round of Epstein emails, released by the US Department of Justice, could remove her even more from public life.",

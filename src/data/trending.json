    "body": "Image source, Andy HoneByRichard WintonBBC Sport in CortinaIt's a Thursday night in November. A pub in Glasgow's Merchant City. Four men, all about the age of 30, are squeezed around a small table, eating and talking about what the next few months might bring. Nobody recognises them.That same pub three months later. Screens showing a Celtic game are changed so the patrons can watch the curling. Almost everyone is anxiously staring at the TVs, willing those same four men to reach a Winter Olympic final.Chances are they will be doing the same on Saturday (18:05 GMT), when Team GB's Bruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie take on Canada with a gold medal at stake.\"Our gold medal,\" as Mouat referred to it after the epic semi-final win over Switzerland in northern Italy on Thursday - a contest which drew 3.4million viewers to the BBC at its peak.And fulfilling what they believe to be their destiny - by upgrading their silver medal from Beijing four years ago - is what these four Scots have travelled to Cortina to do.Since that 2022 near miss, Team Mouat have come to dominate men's curling, winning two World Championships and adding another couple of European crowns, as well as a record 12 Grand Slam titles. At times, they have been unbeatable.That cloak of invincibility slipped during the round-robin stages here - leaving qualification out of their hands - but that fright has now been forgotten, replaced with the return of a clear-eyed focus on the task in hand.But who are these four young men who have now caught the country's attention? And what makes them more than the sum of their parts?Nine years that changed face of curlingTo understand the dynamic between the quartet, you have to go back almost nine years to when they first came together as a team.With the world of curling being as small as it is, they weren't strangers to each other. Hardie and McMillan are 33-year-old cousins from south-west Scotland. Lammie, 29,  hails from there, too, and played in a rink previously with 31-year-old Mouat, who knew the others from their shared school days in Edinburgh.Approaches were made, conversations had, culminating in a meeting. \"That first time we met, the thing we wrote at the top of our list of goals was to win Olympic gold,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.After that, the die was cast. The boys told British Curling they were only willing to join the elite programme as a unit and not individually. Their ultimatum was accepted, success has followed, and now they are considered the best in the world.Mouat is thought to be among the greatest skips to have played the game. Hardie has a reputation as a high-grade tactician and shot maker, while McMillan and Lammie are credited with reinventing the role of a sweeper.Once just 'the lads with the brushes', their physicality has evolved the position to the extent that the curling cognoscenti consider it to now be \"a sweeping game\" rather than a throwing one.Media caption, Semi-final victory 'hardest fought win we've ever had' - GB men's curling teamWill GB quartet make history?But it is the coalescence of their personalities that amplifies all that sporting talent. And underpinning the team are two key things - total honesty and trust.As McMillan puts it \"if one of us is in the wrong, the rest can say so\", while the more-measured Mouat describes it as \"knowing the different things to say to get the best out of each other\".Individually, they are all very different. McMillan is lively enough for all four of them; Hardie is the logic guy, an engineer by trade; Mouat is thoughtful, reflective and calm; and Lammie is the quiet, reliable presence in the background.It might be labelled as 'Team Mouat' - as per the convention of naming a rink after the skip - but this is very much a collective. In fact, Mouat is keen to share the spotlight.\"Bruce is so compassionate and calm and he's very different from a lot of skips,\" explains BBC Sport pundit and 2022 gold medallist Vicky Wright. \"A lot of them are clearly the leader but the GB team operates so well because they function on a level playing field.\"The dynamic they've got works so well because they all bring a different aspect to the table and they all respect that. That's a massive part of why they're so successful.\"Media caption, GB will go for gold after beating Swiss to reach men's curling finalIt's instructive to see how comfortable the four of them are in each other's company and with the position they find themselves in.All four - and alternate Kyle Waddell - have been right in among it in Cortina this week, be it stopping for a chat in the street or in restaurants, meeting friends and relatives, watching other British athletes compete. Or - in Mouat's case - going pillowcase shopping and \"spending far too much money\" on the morning of the semi-final.Even in the moments before that crucial match, there was a relaxed focus about them. McMillan and Hardie were sharing a laugh, Mouat picking out familiar faces in the crowd for a smile and a wave, and Lammie was casually studying the Swiss warming up.All of that will culminate on Saturday night in the quirky Cortina Curling Stadium, first built as an open-air venue to host the 1956 Games.In a place where history looks down from the wooden bleachers, these four will attempt to make their own by becoming the first GB men's rink in 102 years to win Olympic gold.Achieve that, and maybe the next time they go into that Glasgow pub they might just draw a few glances of recognition.Winter Olympics 20266-22 FebruaryMilan-CortinaWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app. CurlingWinter SportsWinter Olympics",

    "body": "5 hours agoMany of Saturday's papers are leading with the latest on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest on suspicion of misconduct in public office. \"Andrew is facing axe from line of succession\" is the Daily Mirror's lead story, reporting he could be \"stripped of his position as the eighth in line to the throne\". The UK government is drafting legislation to \"seal his exit from the Royal Family\", the paper writes, under the headline \"Throne Out\". The Sun splashes \"Andrew's out of line\" for its headline. It adds that King Charles III \"will not object to historic move\" against his brother Andrew, quoting anonymous royal sources. \"Sir Keir Starmer and Buckingham Palace indicated their support\" for removing Andrew from the line of succession is the lead story in the Times. It explains while the former prince \"ceased to be a working member of the royal family in 2019\", he remains eighth in line to the throne – an entitlement that can only be removed by an act of parliament.The Daily Telegraph also writes Andrew's removal from the line of succession would be \"historic\", saying the measure \"would be the most significant change to the line of succession since the abdication of Edward VIII\".\"82% say ditch Andrew from line to throne\" reads the Daily Express headline citing a poll that shows wide public support for \"Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to be cut from the line of succession\".\"Met issues dramatic plea to ex-prince's protection officers\" is the Daily Mail's top story, as detectives investigating Andrew urge his bodyguards \"to 'consider carefully anything they say or heard' while working for him\".The Guardian also leads with Scotland Yard \"expanding its inquiry\" into Andrew \"by approaching all his former protection officers and reviewing records of flights at London's airports to see if they were used for human trafficking\".\"Royal Family fears new investigations and fallout\" reads the i Weekend headline, and it reports: \"Met Police are identifying and contacting Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's former and serving protection officers\".The Daily Star says Andrew's \"trip to the cop shop was pants\". It reports: \"There have been complaints of an undies shortage,\" under the headline: \"You're undie arrest.\"Meanwhile, the Financial Times Weekend says \"Trump pledges fresh tariffs\" after the US Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the president had \"exceeded his authority\" in imposing tariffs on international trading partners. In response, Trump \"vowed to impose a 10 per cent 'global tariff' by alternative means\". Related Internet Links",

They visit care homes and hospices across the country.Luke Fillary, head bird keeper, was on hand at the home to provide instructions on how to interact with the birds to keep them and the residents safe.The 21-year-old handler said Pringle and Widget had been trained their entire lives to become therapy penguins.\"They both have been born at our zoo, so they have been in training their whole life,\" he said.\"Officially, they have been doing it for the past six years. Both are very well behaved.\"Jackie Kirkham visited her 91-year-old dad Derek when the penguins arrivedResidents of the care home also had the opportunity to invite their families along to meet the penguins.Jackie Kirkham, from Clifton in Nottingham, came to visit her 91-year-old dad Derek.She said: \"It's just something new for them, something that they probably won't be doing. He enjoys it and we do - it's comforting.\"The care home invites other therapy animals for residents to encounter.Bridget Peck, wellbeing coordinator at the home, said she had seen the benefit in bringing animals to the residents.\"I think animals play an important role for everybody's wellbeing,\" she said.\"Not just dogs - we have donkeys, ponies, every Easter we have the ducks and chickens come in.

It's coming.\"The first rehearsal, which took place at the beginning of February, ended early because of a hydrogen fuel leak at the launch pad.Glaze said issues including with seals and filters had now been remedied.\"Yesterday we were able to fully tank the SLS rocket within the planned time line […] we also succesfully demonstrated the launch countdown,\" she said.Three Americans - Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch - and one Canadian, Jeremy Hansen, make up the Artemis II crew.Glaze said the crew were excited following the successful rehearsal and would go into quarantine later on Friday.They'll begin their journey on Nasa's mega Moon rocket: the 98m-tall (322ft) Space Launch System, or SLS.It's only flown once before in November 2022 for the Artemis I mission, but this was with no people onboard.The crew will be strapped into the Orion capsule, which is located at the top of the rocket.The inside of their spacecraft is about the size of a minibus, and it's where the four will live, eat, work and sleep during the 10-day mission.The first day of their journey will be spent in orbit around the Earth, then if all systems are working well, the astronauts will head towards the Moon.The voyage takes about four days, and the crew will travel around the far side of the Moon, which is the side we never see from Earth.They'll be at a distance of 6,500-9,500km (4,000 to 6,000 miles) above the lunar surface, and will have several hours dedicated to studying and taking images of the Moon.After the fly by, the astronauts will begin their four-day journey home. They will end the mission with a splash down in the Pacific Ocean.NASAApollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt visited the Moon in 1972The mission, if successful, will pave the way for Artemis III, which will see astronauts set foot on the lunar surface. The last time humans visited the Moon was in 1972 for the Apollo 17 mission.Nasa says the landing will happen by 2028, but this is a very ambitious timescale.Elon Musk's SpaceX company has a contract to build the lander for Artemis III - which will be flown to the Moon on a SpaceX Starship rocket. But delays to the Starship rocket have led Nasa to ask SpaceX for a new streamlined plan to speed a return to the Moon.Nasa has also asked rival company Blue Origin - which is owned by Jeff Bezos - to come up with an accelerated lunar plan for Artemis III.As the tech billionaires battle it out, the US is under pressure to return to the Moon. China is aiming for a lunar landing by 2030, and has been making steady progress towards this.Both nations are planning to land at the Moon's south pole - and are competing for the best spots to build their lunar bases.",

    "body": "Puberty blockers trial paused over concerns from medicines watchdog9 hours agoAmy WalkerandAlison Holt,Social affairs editorGetty ImagesA clinical trial assessing the risks and benefits of puberty-blocking drugs in children who question their gender has been paused after safety concerns were raised by the UK medicines watchdog.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is set to hold talks with King's College London, whose researchers are leading the trial, next week to address concerns, the government said.Details of the trial, which would involve more than 220 children aged between about 11 and 15, were announced in November after getting approval from the MHRA and Health Research Authority.An MHRA spokesperson said the \"safety and wellbeing\" of participants - yet to be recruited - was \"paramount\".Puberty blockers for people under-18 questioning their gender identity were banned in 2024. The drugs, also known as puberty suppressing hormones (PSH), are used to delay or prevent puberty happening.The clinical trial, called Pathways, was set to involve children who are distressed about their gender and currently accessing gender services. It would examine the impact of the drugs on their physical, social and emotional wellbeing. But the MHRA has suggested the minimum age limit of those taking part should be increased to 14, and that there should be more detailed monitoring of bone density and a more rigorous consent process for participants.In a letter published on the government website on Friday, the MHRA expressed concern over the current age limit for participants in the trial.\"Since potentially significant and, as yet, unquantified risk of long-term biological harms is present to participants and biological safety has not been definitively demonstrated in this proposed cohort, at the very least, there should be a graded/stepwise approach starting with those aged 14 as the lower limit of eligibility,\" it reads.In a separate statement on Friday evening, an MHRA spokesperson said it was \"part of the usual process that clinical trials are kept continuously under review and for us to have active scientific dialogue with the trial sponsors\".\"We have raised some concerns related to the wellbeing of participants and scientific dialogue will now follow with the trial sponsor,\" they added.The Department of Health & Social Care (DHSC) said participants would not be recruited until the issues raised had been resolved between the MHRA and the trial clinicians. \"We have always been clear about the red lines regarding this trial – ensuring the safety and wellbeing of the children and young people involved and always being led by the clinical evidence,\" a spokesperson said.They added that the trial would \"only be allowed to go ahead if the expert scientific and clinical evidence and advice conclude it is both safe and necessary\".A spokesperson for King's College London said the wellbeing and health of young people with gender incongruence and their families was its \"priority\".It added that \"rigour and ongoing scientific discussion\" was important for a clinical trial, \"particularly one as complex as Pathways\".Some doctors have questioned whether the trial is necessary.  Campaigners are also taking legal action against the MHRA, the government and others involved in the trial. They claim it is unethical and that children cannot give fully informed consent to a treatment which might affect their future fertility.A 2024 review by Dr Hilary Cass found gender medicine had been operating on \"shaky foundations\" when it came to evidence for treatment, with the ban for puberty blockers for under-18s introduced after the review raised concerns about their safety.",

    "body": "Multi-cancer blood test missed key goal in NHS trial4 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentGetty ImagesA blood test which looks for multiple types of cancer has failed to achieve its key objective in a major NHS trial, the company has announced.The Galleri blood test is being trialled on 142,000 NHS patients with the goal of finding cancers early and saving lives.However, the company behind the test, Grail, said there were still positive signs in the data that some of the most aggressive cancers could be prevented.But researchers said any benefits of the test \"remain speculative\" until it was proven to save lives and the NHS said it was looking at the results \"carefully\".The blood test searches for fragments of DNA – or genetic code – that have escaped from tumours and entered the bloodstream.The vision is to detect up to 50 types of cancer before the person has any symptoms.At the start of the clinical trial, NHS England described the test as \"the beginning of a revolution\".The trial was designed to see if screening people's blood would reduce the number of cancers being diagnosed at later stages when they may be harder to treat.Stage three cancers are when a tumour has started to spread locally, stage four is when they have spread to distant organs in the body too.The full data from the three-year NHS trial has not been published, but Grail has issued an update to investors.It said: \"While there was a trend towards reduction in combined stage three and four [cancers], the trial did not meet the primary endpoint.\"Grail, a US pharmaceutical company, halved in value after the announcement taking its share price back to levels seen at the end of the summer.However, a further analysis looking at stage four cancers alone showed they fell by around a fifth in the study, suggesting the most deadly cancers were being detected at an earlier stage.How much attention should be paid to this result, when it was not the main focus of the trial, has become a major debating point.Prof Charles Swanton, who is running the trials within the NHS, told the BBC he was \"genuinely very excited\" about the reduction in stage four cancers.\"I've been working in oncology for 20 years and the key, in my mind, is to reduce stage four because these are the cancers we cannot cure,\" he said.However, other experts say the focus has to be on the primary endpoint as that is what the trial was designed to test.Prof Richard Houlston, from the Institute of Cancer Research, said: \"Without mortality data and a transparent account of harms, including false positives, unnecessary procedures, and opportunity cost, claims of population benefit from multi-cancer early detection remain speculative,\" he said.The full data is due to be presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this year.An NHS spokesperson said: \"This evidence is an important step and the NHS will carefully study the full results from this major trial in the coming months to help determine how blood tests like this could be used in the future.\"",

    "body": "21 minutes agoRichard Wheeler,political reporterandNick Eardley,political correspondentGetty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor was pictured wearing Order of the Garter robes at his brother's coronation in 2023The government is considering introducing legislation to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the line of royal succession.Defence Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC the move - which would prevent Andrew from ever becoming King - was the \"right thing to do,\" regardless of the outcome of the police investigation.Currently Andrew, the King's brother, remains eighth in line to the throne despite being stripped of his titles, including \"prince\", last October amid pressure over his ties to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions programme, Pollard confirmed the government had \"absolutely\" been working with Buckingham Palace on the plans to stop the former prince from \"potentially being a heartbeat away from the throne\".He said this was \"something that I hope will enjoy cross party support, but its right that that is something that only happens when the police investigation concludes\".On Saturday, several unmarked police cars were again seen entering Royal Lodge, the 30-room Windsor property where Andrew lived for many years.At one point on Friday more than 20 vehicles could be seen parked at the property, although it is not known it all was connected to the investigation and searches.Thames Valley Police, the force which arrested him, is expected to continue searching Royal Lodge until Monday, the BBC understands.The government's proposal comes after some MPs, including the Liberal Democrats and SNP, signalled their support for such legislation.Some Labour parliamentarians who have been critical of the monarchy told the BBC they were less convinced the move was required - in part because it is so unlikely the former Duke of York would ever get near to the throne.In October, Downing Street said it had no plans to introduce a law to change the line of succession. After the latest revelations, historian David Olusoga told BBC Newsnight there is now \"a desperate desire within government and within the palace to draw a firewall… between this crisis and the wider monarchy\".Buckingham Palace has not publicly commented on the government's plans to remove Andrew from the line of succession.The move would require an act of Parliament, which would have to be approved by MPs and peers and would come into effect when given royal assent by the King.It would also need to be supported by the 14 Commonwealth countries where Charles III is head of state, including Canada, Australia, Jamaica and New Zealand.The last time the line of succession was changed by an act of Parliament was in 2013, when the Succession to the Crown Act restored individuals who had previously been excluded because they had married a Catholic.The last time someone was removed from the line of succession by an act of Parliament was in 1936, when the former Edward VIII and his descendants were removed due to his abdication.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said police should be \"allowed to get on with their job, acting without fear or favour\".He added: \"But clearly this is an issue that Parliament is going to have to consider when the time is right, naturally the monarchy will want to make sure he can never become King.\"The SNP would support removing Andrew from the line of succession if legislation is required, according to the party's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn.Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, has also backed the move.She said: \"I would support legislation to remove Andrew from the line of succession and to remove from the counsellor of state.\"Counsellors of state can stand in for a monarch who is ill or overseas although, in practice, only working royals are expected to be called upon to fulfil those duties. Mountbatten-Windsor stepped back from public duties in 2019 following a backlash after an interview with BBC Newsnight about his relationship with Epstein.Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"all of us in public life need to give space\" to the police investigation to be carried out.

    "body": "10 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,White House reporterandCachella SmithGetty ImagesIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a proposal for an agreement with the US will be ready in daysUS President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.  US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.Speaking on Friday, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.\"The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,\" one of Khamenei's posts read.Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week - often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One - but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.\"I'm not going to talk to you about that,\" he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. \"We're going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.\"Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year - which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities - White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because \"negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks\".Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of immigration and the economy.Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump's Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLana LamCootamundraBBC goes inside the beach volleyball contest hours from the nearest coastLike many wild and wacky ideas, it all started down at the pub.\"I was literally looking out the window at that intersection and thought, 'What if we put in a beach volleyball court and play a competition?'\"On a tar road. In the middle of a town 400km from the nearest beach,\" Simon Sutherland, 51, says.He wanted to bring the party vibe of Bali's Kuta – a popular island holiday spot for many Australians – to his hometown of Cootamundra.And so that night he went home and drew up plans for Australia's own \"Coota Beach\" and its now famous annual volleyball tournament.Twenty-five years on, it's grown from a single day of play into a three-day festival – a cultural and sporting highlight in the town's calendar, delighting locals, attracting thousands of tourists and bringing in an estimated $2m in revenue.\"In a way, I think it's bigger than Christmas,\" 86-year-old grandmother Pat Roberts, who tells the BBC she has made cheering on her children and grandchildren a summer tradition.\"I've loved it every year, I've never missed one.\"From one court to tenIt's Saturday afternoon and the tournament resembles a beach bash in full swing, costumed bodies heaving under the blazing sun.\"Mine!\" calls out one singlet-clad player to her teammates, making it to a volleyball just in time. Loud pop and rock music blares down the entire block, punctuated by the odd cheer and whoop from spectators.Over on one court, a team of minions – complete with yellow-painted faces, oversized googles and beach-styled overalls – are jumping excitedly much like their animated namesake.Many teams play in fancy dress like this team of minions from the animated film.Elsewhere, teams like Holy Blockamole and Itsy Bitsy Spiker are dropping shots like it's hot, diving to make saves and drinking like it's the last days of summer.There's plenty of laughs as teams of six serve, spike and block during the 20-minute matches, with rules that are a mix of indoor and beach volleyball.Suncream's being slathered on, high-fives are flowing as freely as the cold drinks. In between matches, hard-working staff are hosing down the courts to cool the sand.It's a stark contrast to the first Coota Beach event in 2001 – when 16 teams played a couple dozen matches on a single court in one day. This year's event had almost 200 teams playing over three days. Demand was so high, 40 teams were turned away.Sutherland remembers the early years clearly.\"We used to get up at 1am and start setting up on the Saturday morning, ready to go for games at 8am,\" he recalls, shaking his head in mild disbelief as he glances over the ten courts at this year's event.Kaktus ScotWhat started as a one-day event is now a three-day tournamentThese days, transforming the asphalt landscape into a sandy oasis takes about a week, with almost 900 tonnes of sand – that's about six blue whales or 70 double-decker buses – trucked in.James Graham, owner of the quarry where the sand is sourced from, says the town's order is the strangest request he's ever had: \"Who am I to tell people what to do with it?,\" he jokes.Council workers then flatten the huge mounds of sand to create an inland beach, ready for the first games on Friday.Hours after the finals wrap up on Sunday and all the eskies have been packed away, workers and volunteers try to scoop up every last grain of sand, which is either sold or donated to the community, turning up in local parks, sporting grounds or construction sites.Within two days, the road – buffed and cleaned - returns to its usual form, lined with parked cars and locals going about their daily errands.Costumes and camaraderieKaktus ScotTeams of six play 20-minute matches with crowds cheering from the sidelinesOrganiser Lee-Anne Hogan estimates the town's usual population of 7,000 swells by about 3,000 over the weekend. \"It's enormous - the town actually books out in every way\".While, in the early days, there were fears from some businesses that closing a street might mean fewer customers, those worries have disappeared.A No Vacancy sign out the front of his Southern Comfort Motor Inn, Dylan O'Neill says: \"It's clear that every hospitality business in town benefits significantly from the event.\"Among those who have flocked to Cootamundra for the weekend are British couple Guy Wilkinson and Lizzie Ellison, both 30, who moved to Sydney two years ago and have driven four hours to compete.It's a \"true rural experience,\" that feels \"uniquely Australian\", Ellison says.\"It's a super fun, friendly vibe,\" Wilkinson adds.Their team – all dressed in tasselled cowboy outfits – have nabbed the prize for best-dressed, tying with another team decked out in pink nighties and platinum blonde wigs.Kaktus ScotYee-haw! This group of cowboys and cowgirls came tied in the best dressed award...Kaktus Scot... with this team looking pretty in pink.\"We've had people come here from Manly in Sydney saying that these are better courts to play on than the ones at the beaches there,\" Sutherland brags, \"I don't think we can get a better wrap than that.\"Whether you're a long-time local or new to Coota, the weekend is an opportunity to cultivate a sense of community.Sia Lesa speaks to the BBC as she is about to step onto court eight for her third and final match of the day.She recently moved to town from her native Samoa as part of a visa scheme that has seen hundreds of Pacific Islanders relocate to Australia for jobs.\"I arrived in 2024, right on the day of the tournament,\" she says. \"I arrived in the early morning and I played in the afternoon, no kidding.\"Sia, who moved from Samoa a few years ago, enjoys the community spirit of the eventFor Lesa, the social aspect of the weekend is a rare chance to feel part of a community that often feels closed off to her.\"Coota is very small and [this is] something different for us, because normally we work at the abattoir and straight after we finish work, we go home and stay there.\"It's certainly a homely affair for James Dunk, who has played every year for about a decade and always enters a team made up of three sets of neighbours.Last year, his son joined the team as he had just turned 14 – the minimum age to participate. \"It's almost a rite of passage before they ditch you and go and have more fun with their friends,\" he jokes.Founder Simon Sutherland and his son Eamon, 14, who got to play for the first time this yearThat's exactly the case for Sutherland's son Eamon, 14, who finally had a chance to join in, after years of watching from the sidelines.\"It's so exciting to get to play,\" he smiles, his team's name – Spiked and Served – emblazoned on his singlet.As the sun sets and players dust off their sandy feet, Sutherland says he has big plans to expand the shoreline of Coota Beach.\"I want it to be as big as the Elvis Festival in Parkes,\" he says, referring to the week-long celebrations in another regional Australian town that draws tens of thousands of fans every January to celebrate the King of Rock.\"The more people we can bring into the Coota sphere, the better - people that would rarely go to a country town. Come and see what we've got to offer.\"",

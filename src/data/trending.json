    "body": "9 hours agoLucy Manning,Special correspondent and Fiona NimoniBBCA Scunthorpe United player and a Nottingham Forest fan are among the victims stabbed in a knife attack on a train in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening. They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved livesWhat do we know about Cambridgeshire train stabbings?Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.Mr Crean described how he \"tussled\" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.\"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.\"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.\"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.\"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing\".Mr Crean said the man asked him: \"Do you want to die? Do you want to die?\" \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head.\"Scunthorpe UnitedScunthorpe United football player Jonathan GjosheMr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.\"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Stephen Crean still had blood in his hair when he spoke to the BBC",

    "body": "2 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamA worker who was trapped after part of a medieval tower collapsed in the heart of Rome has been rescued, according to local media reports. The man was pulled free at 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT) - nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath. He has been taken to hospital. The Romanian foreign ministry said the trapped man was from Romania, as was another worker who was among three others pulled from the rubble. One is said to be in a critical condition.The tower has been closed to the public for many years, and was undergoing conservation work when a section collapsed.Talking of the rescued worker, Rome mayor Roberto Gualtieri said: \"We hope that he will pull through.\"Rome prefect Lamberto Giannini told reporters the worker was pulled from the rubble after \"a long rescue mission\".Earlier he had described it as a \"very complex situation\". Giannini said that after the initial collapse firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".He added that the rescue would be a long operation due to having to \"mitigate...the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".The Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident. Efforts to rescue the worker - reported to be in his 60s - were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again, with bricks raining down, creating a huge cloud of dust.One firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to local media, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.A police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower will disintegrate. \"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and the country's culture minister visited the scene. A crane and drone are also being used to assist with the rescue operation.The 13th Century tower is part of the Roman Forum, a major tourist attraction right in the heart of the city, but it is separated from the main visitors' area by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.The medieval tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.",

Other acts on the bill include Pendulum, Cypress Hill, Babymetal and Black Veil Brides. They'll be joined by metal heavyweights Trivium, Mastodon and Architects, alongside indie-rockers Feeder and Ash, across the weekend of 10 to 14 June.Linkin Park's presence at the top of the bill will mark the first time a female-fronted band has headlined the three-day rock and metal event since its launch in 2023.The nu-metal group reformed last year with Emily Armstrong as their new lead singer.They have gone on a world tour and recorded their first new material since the death of former frontman Chester Bennington, who took his own life in 2017.The choice of Emily upset some fans, who pointed to her alleged ties to the Church of Scientology and past support for convicted rapist Danny Masterson.Chester Bennington's family also criticised the band with his son, Jaime, accusing remaining members of \"quietly erasing\" his father's \"life and legacy\".Emily has distanced herself from Masterson, while Linkin Park founding member Mike Shinoda has insisted she is not trying to replace anyone.Next year's Download will also be a first for Limp Bizkit, who have never headlined the festival.Their appearance at this year's Leeds Festival was the last time they performed live with founding member and bassist Sam Rivers, who died last month aged 48.Rock legends Guns N' Roses are currently in the middle of a world tour, and recently appeared at Ozzy Osbourne's final live show in his hometown of Birmingham. Download bills itself as a festival \"spanning the full spectrum of rock, metal, punk, emo, hardcore, alternative and classic rock\".In recent years Download has also featured pop acts and surprise guests, with the Vengaboys an unlikely addition to 2024's line-up.And Dogstar - the band formed by actor Keanu Reeves - are due to perform in 2026.

    "body": "Budget will be 'fair' says Reeves as tax rises expected58 minutes agoJennifer MeierhansBusiness reporterPA MediaTax rises could mean reversing a core election manifesto pledge of not raising VAT, National Insurance or income taxChancellor Rachel Reeves says she will take \"fair choices\" in the Budget as economists continue to predict tax rises to try to balance the books.Reeves is expected to give a speech to Downing Street later ahead of the 26 November Budget. Labour explicitly ruled out a rise in VAT, National Insurance or income tax in its general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said with an \"emergency press conference\" Reeves was \"all but confirming what many feared - higher taxes are on the way\". He called for the chancellor to be sacked if she \"breaks her promises yet again\".Meanwhile influential think tank the Resolution Foundation has said tax rises are now \"inevitable\".Avoiding cuts to VAT, NI or income tax \"would do more harm than good\", warned the foundation which has close links to Labour - Treasury Minister Torsten Bell was previously its chief executive.Hiking income tax would be the \"best option\" for raising cash, it said, but suggested it should be offset by a 2p cut to employee national insurance, which would \"raise £6 billion overall while protecting most workers from this tax rise\".Extending the freeze in personal tax thresholds for two more years beyond April 2028 would also raise £7.5 billion, its Autumn Budget 2025 preview suggested.The chancellor is expected to say in a speech on Tuesday morning that the Budget will focus on \"fairness and opportunity\" to bring down NHS waiting lists, the national debt and the cost of living. \"You will all have heard a lot of speculation about the choices I will make,\" she is expected to say.\"I understand that - these are important choices that will shape our economy for years to come.\"But it is important that people understand the circumstances we are facing, the principles guiding my choices – and why I believe they will be the right choices for the country.\"The message from Reeves is expected to echo comments made by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to a group of Labour MPs on Monday night. He told those gathered that the Budget would be \"a Labour Budget built on Labour values\" and that the government would \"make the tough but fair decisions to renew our country and build it for the long term\". The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is widely expected to downgrade its productivity forecasts for the UK at the end of the month. This could add as much as £20 billion to the Chancellor's costs if she is to meet her self-imposed \"non-negotiable\" rules for government finances. The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentThe Treasury declined to comment on \"speculation\" ahead of the OBR's final forecast, which will be published on 26 November alongside the Budget.However last week, the chancellor confirmed both tax rises and spending cuts are options as she aims to give herself \"sufficient headroom\" against future economic shocks.The Resolution Foundation said changes in the economic outlook and policy U-turns are likely to reduce the current £9.9 billion of headroom against the chancellor's borrowing rule into a fiscal black hole of around £4 billion.It urged Reeves to double the level of headroom she has against her fiscal rules to £20 billion. This would \"send a clear message to markets that she is serious about fixing the public finances, which in turn should reduce medium-term borrowing costs and make future fiscal events less fraught,\" its Budget preview said.It comes after the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said last month there was a \"strong case\" to increase the headroom. It said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor \"limping from one forecast to the next\".",

Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.These pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.BBC StudiosA pride of lions plays beside a riverReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers. The external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.Speaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"Kingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

    "body": "7 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterCivil service bosses have told MPs that Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as UK ambassador to the US due to close links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was never formally interviewed for the job.The head of the civil service, Sir Chris Wormald, said there was no interview because Lord Mandelson was directly appointed to the role.MPs heard that process meant Lord Mandelson was not directly asked about any conflict of interest with interviewers in person, but instead needed to fill in a form aimed more at potential financial conflicts.Sir Chris said this process has been changed since Lord Mandelson's exit, to ensure a formal, minuted interview happens.Lord Mandelson replaced career diplomat Dame Karen Pierce in Washington DC in December 2024, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer decided he was the best candidate to build links with the newly-elected Trump administration. Concern around Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein were raised at the time, but his ability to deal with President Trump, as well as his ability as a networker and seasoned political operator, was seen as a valuable asset.That changed when emails were published showing Lord Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008, which the government insisted was new information about the \"depth\" of the pair's relationship.Sir Keir fired him in September, a day after having told MPs the Labour peer retained his \"full confidence\" at PMQs.Ambassadors are managed by the Foreign Office and the civil service, and bosses of both were answering questions from MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.Foreign Office head, Sir Oliver Robbins, was asked whether Lord Mandelson went through the normal process for appointing an ambassador and told MPs: \"No, it was different because this was not run as a standard civil service process.\"Labour MP Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Mandelson's interview specifically included the opportunity to share \"anything that could bring the government into disrepute\".Sir Chris said: \"There was no interview for Mr Mandelson, it was done as a direct appointment by ministers, as Sir Oliver has described, and therefore there was no panel interview.\"That was the normal practice for direct ministerial appointments.\"Changes have been made since Lord Mandelson's sacking, Sir Chris added, \"so that we effectively replicate what would normally happen in a panel interview... where there is a minuted conversation with the candidate\".Sir Oliver said Lord Mandelson did complete a conflict of interest form, but when pressed on whether that included \"friendships\", he said: \"No, it's not a sort of reputational conflict that's being targeted by that form, it's about reality of perception of economic or financial conflicts.\"The two were also questioned on why Sir Keir appeared not to have been fully briefed about the seriousness of the new information by civil servants before defending Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).Conservative MP Sir John Whittingdale set out how emails were sent to the Foreign Office by journalists at Bloomberg on Tuesday evening. He said: \"It must have been apparent to you before the prime minister got up at 12 o'clock on Wednesday that this was pretty explosive and did somebody not say to Number 10 'hold on, just before you express your complete confidence in Lord Mandelson there's something here you might like to be aware of'.\"Defending the material being treated \"sensitively and as a management issue\", Sir Oliver said he needed to treat Lord Mandelson \"as an employee to whom I owed a duty of care\". Sir John responded: \"So you're saying to protect Lord Mandelson you gave no indication to Number 10 before PMQs that you had come across information which might cause serious doubt as to the appropriateness of his position?\"Lord Mandelson had not had a chance to respond to the Foreign Office about the \"veracity and risks\" around the emails ahead of PMQs, Sir Oliver said, adding \"I had not personally spoken to the prime minister, no.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "10 hours agoSebastian UsherMiddle East analyst, JerusalemIDFMajor General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned on Friday, admitting her role in leaking the videoThe former top lawyer in the Israeli military has been arrested, as a political showdown deepens over the leaking of a video that allegedly shows severe abuse of a Palestinian detainee by Israeli soldiers.Maj Gen Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned as the Military Advocate General of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last week, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak.On Sunday, the story took a darker turn when she was reported as missing, with police mounting an hours-long search for her on a beach north of Tel Aviv.She was subsequently found alive and well, police said, but was then taken into custody.The fallout from the leaked video is intensifying by the day.Broadcast in August 2024 on an Israeli news channel, the footage shows reserve soldiers at the Sde Teiman military base in southern Israel taking aside a detainee, then surrounding him with riot shields to block visibility while he was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object.The detainee was treated for severe injuries.Five reservists were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee. They have denied the charges and have not been named.On Sunday, four of the reservists wore black balaclavas to hide their faces as they appeared at a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Jerusalem along with their lawyers, who demanded the dismissal of their trial.Adi Keidar, a lawyer from the right-wing legal aid organisation Honenu, claimed his clients were subject to \"to a faulty, biased and completely cooked-up legal process\".Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe leaked surveillance video was filmed at the Sde Teiman military base in southern IsraelOn Monday, it emerged the detainee at the centre of the case was released to Gaza in October as part of an exchange with Hamas of convicted prisoners and detainees held without charge by Israel for hostages held by Hamas since 7 October 2023. Last week, a criminal investigation was launched into the leaking of the video.Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was put on leave while the inquiry took place.On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said she would not be allowed to return to her post.Shortly after that, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi resigned.In her resignation letter, she said she took full responsibility for any material that was released to the media from the unit.\"I approved the release of material to the media in an attempt to counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities,\" she said.That is a reference to efforts by some right-wing political figures in Israel to claim that the allegations of severe abuse of the Palestinian detainee had been fabricated.She added: \"It is our duty to investigate whenever there is reasonable suspicion of acts of violence against a detainee.\"After her resignation, Katz issued a fierce condemnation of her conduct.\"Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army's uniform,\" he said.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed his defence minister's words on Sunday, saying that the incident at Sde Teiman was \"perhaps the most severe public relations attack that the State of Israel has experienced since its establishment\".Hours later, the first reports began appearing in the Israeli media that Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi was missing, sparking fears that a political scandal had taken a turn towards tragedy.A massive search effort was launched. Several hours later, she was found \"safe and in good health\" in the coastal area of Herzliya, Israeli police said.Overnight, a police spokesperson announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of \"leaking and other serious criminal offences\" as part of an investigation.Israeli media reported that the pair were Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi and the former chief military prosecutor, Col Matan Solomosh.ReutersIsraeli forces mounted an hours-long search for Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi when she went missing on SundayThe Sde Teiman incident has been a lightning rod for the division between the left and right in Israel.On the right, the leaking of the video is denounced as a defamation of the Israeli military, all but amounting to an act of treason.After Israeli military police went to Sde Teiman to question 11 reservists over the incident in July 2024, far-right protesters - including at least three lawmakers from Netanyahu's governing coalition - broke into the facility to show their support.On the left, Gen Tomer-Yerushalmi's decision to enable the footage to be released is seen as the one time she lived up to the responsibilities of her post.The video is regarded by the left as concrete evidence backing up multiple reports of abuse of Palestinian detainees since the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.Last October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been \"subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence\".Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was \"fully committed to international legal standards\". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint.",

    "body": "54 minutes agoColletta Smith,Cost of living correspondent and Elaine Doran,ProducerBBCCarla McLoughlin regularly borrows from familyPeople turn to family and friends for money more often than Buy Now Pay Later loans, a new survey has suggested, and for most of them it was for less than £250. The survey of more than 4,000 adults commissioned by non-profit Fair4All Finance, shared exclusively with the BBC, found that while 25% of respondents had taken out a Buy Now Pay Later loan, 26% had borrowed from family and 15% from friends this year.Many relied on friends and relatives because they had been turned down by traditional services like banks - but some of those loans still come with interest.For 42-year-old Carla McLoughlin, borrowing small sums from her mum is crucial.The mother-of-three explains that the money is needed \"just to tide us over for a week or two until we get paid\".But some people said borrowing from their nearest and dearest had affected those relationships.Of those who borrowed from family, 9% said it weakened the relationship, and that figure rises to 17% when borrowing from friends, with different expectations of repayment souring relationships.The dynamics get trickier for many with 16% of people who borrowed from friends and 8% of those that borrowed from family saying they were charged interest. Val Lucus, Carla's 63-year-old mother, said she's lent to other family members who didn't pay her back.\"You're constantly chasing it up. That can be difficult,\" she said. 'We do it all the time'Val Lucas lends and borrows money from her childrenFair4All Finance was set up 2019 by the government, and campaigns to make financial products available to a wider group of people. The research was carried out in collaboration with polling firm Ipsos, and included people from England, Scotland and Wales.  It found that younger adults, households with children, and people on zero-hours contracts or in lower-paid work are most likely to borrow from friends and family. The research also showed that a quarter of all households would not be able to afford a £500 emergency bill without borrowing. But the flow of cash is not all in one direction for Carla and her mum Val. They live close by in Merseyside, and regularly have to borrow from each other. \"We do it all the time. If I need £50 just to get a few bits to tide me over,\" Carla said.\"Two weeks later she'll be short so I give that back and if she needs a bit extra I give it to her.\"Carla has been turned down for a loan in the past and struggled to get a phone contract, so Val has been happy to help. Carla has also seen her mum pawn her grandmother's rings in the past. \"I was crying my eyes out, saying mum why didn't you ask me?\" she said, adding that she wants to help her mum whenever she can, and has paid for her mum's gas and electricity bills in the past.The pair said it has not impacted their relationship, and have never charged each other interest, but they have seen it go wrong for others.  \"Some people say they'll pay you back but then they don't. Then they're messing it up for themselves,\" Carla added.Nowhere else to turnA lot of people turn to family and friends because they have been turned down by banks, credit cards or Buy Now Pay Later services. For others it could be a cheaper option to avoid overdraft fees or high-interest short-term loans. Kate Pender, the boss of Fair4All Finance, said it was important everyone has access to credit for the unexpected moments in life. \"No one should have to risk their closest relationships just to cover essential costs. We urgently need to expand access to safe, affordable credit so people aren't forced into difficult choices,\" she said.Of those surveyed, 4% had turned to a loan shark, or unregistered lender within the last 12 months. That figure could be even higher, as some of those who think they are borrowing from a \"friend\" may actually have borrowed from a loan shark - a person who is lending to multiple people, charging high interest, and often using intimidation to get repayment.Dave Benbow head of the England Illegal Money Lending Team, known as Stop Loan Sharks, said about half of all people the organisation supports believed the loan shark was a friend at the time of borrowing.\"All too often we see situations where extra charges are suddenly added, the debt spirals, and borrowers find themselves trapped,\" he said.Moneyhelper, an independent website backed by the government, says it's important to think carefully before borrowing from someone in your family or a friend. If you struggle to repay this could put pressure on you and your relationship.They suggest good forward planning and a written agreement can help whether you're the one doing the borrowing or lending.Can I lend money safely?Be completely honest with yourself about whether you can afford to lend the money if it was never paid back. If you feel pressured, or awkward, then say no. There are safe borrowing options, like Credit Unions you could direct a loved one to. Keep a written record - an email, text or Whatsapp could be enough - saying how much your lending and when you'd like to be repaid.Offer to help in another way - perhaps pay a bill directly for someone in need.Encourage the person asking to get help from a debt organisation. Help them get on top of their finances, don't just keep bailing people out. ",

    "body": "I'm the luckiest man alive, but also suffering, says Air India crash sole survivor18 hours agoNavtej Johal,Midlands correspondent, Katie Thompson and Sophie WoodcockViswashkumar Ramesh breaks down in tears as he talks about the loss of his brother in the crashThe sole survivor of the Air India plane crash, which killed 241 people on board, has said he feels like the \"luckiest man\" alive, but is also suffering physically and mentally.Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the wreckage of the London-bound flight in Ahmedabad in extraordinary scenes that amazed the world.He said it was a \"miracle\" he escaped but told how he has lost everything, as his younger brother Ajay was a few seats away on the flight and died in the crash in June.Since returning to his home in Leicester, Mr Ramesh has struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), his advisers said, and has been unable to speak to his wife and four-year-old son.Flames engulfed the Boeing 787 flight when it went down shortly after take-off in western India.Shocking video shared at the time showed Mr Ramesh walking away from the aftermath with seemingly superficial injuries, as smoke billowed in the background. Speaking to BBC News, an emotional Mr Ramesh, whose first language is Gujarati, said: \"I'm only one survivor. Still, I'm not believing. It's a miracle.\"I lost my brother as well. My brother is my backbone. Last few years, he was always supporting me.\"He described the devastating impact the ordeal has had on his family life.\"Now I'm alone. I just sit in my room alone, not talking with my wife, my son. I just like to be alone in my house,\" Mr Ramesh said.Watch: The moment Viswashkumar Ramesh walked away from the crashHe spoke from his hospital bed in India at the time, describing how he had managed to unbuckle himself and crawl out of the wreckage, and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while receiving treatment for his injuries.Of the passengers and crew killed, 169 were Indian nationals and 52 were Britons, while 19 others were killed on the ground.A preliminary report into the crash, published by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in July, said fuel supply to the engines was cut off just seconds after take-off. Meanwhile, an investigation is ongoing and the airline said care for Mr Ramesh, and all families affected by the tragedy, \"remains our absolute priority\".This is the first time the 39-year-old has spoken to the media since he has been back in the UK. Several news organisations were invited for an interview and a documentary crew was also filming in the room.The BBC had detailed discussions with his advisers around his duty of care before the interview.When asked about his memories of the day of the crash, he said: \"I can't say anything about that now.\"'I'm suffering'Flanked by local community leader Sanjiv Patel and spokesman Radd Seiger, Mr Ramesh said it was too painful to recall the events of the disaster, and broke down during parts of an interview at the home of Mr Patel in Leicester.Mr Ramesh described the anguish he and his family are now living through.\"For me, after this accident... very difficult.\"Physically, mentally, also my family as well, mentally... my mum last four months, she is sitting every day outside the door, not talking, nothing.\"I'm not talking to anyone else. I do not like to talk with anyone else.\"I can't talk about much. I'm thinking all night, I'm suffering mentally.\"Every day is painful for the whole family.\"Mr Ramesh also spoke about the physical injuries he suffered in the crash, which saw him escape his seat - 11A - through an opening in the fuselage.He says he suffers pain in his leg, shoulder, knee and back, and has not been able to work or drive since the tragedy.\"When I walk, not walk properly, slowly, slowly, my wife help,\" he added.Sanjiv Patel said he was supporting, advising and protecting the familyMr Ramesh was diagnosed with PTSD while he was being treated in hospital in India but has not received any medical treatment since being back home, his advisers said.They described him as being lost and broken, with a long journey of recovery ahead, and are demanding a meeting with Air India's executives, claiming he has been treated poorly by the airline since the crash.\"They're in crisis, mentally, physically, financially,\" Mr Patel said.\"It's devastated his family.\"Whoever's responsible at the highest level should be on the ground meeting the victims of this tragic event, and understanding their needs and to be heard.\"'Put things right'Air India has offered an interim compensation payment to Mr Ramesh of £21,500, which has been accepted, but his advisers say this is not enough to meet his immediate needs.The family fishing business in Diu in India, which Mr Ramesh ran with his brother before the crash, has since collasped, his advisers said.Spokesman for the family Mr Seiger said they had invited Air India for a meeting on three occasions, and all three were either \"ignored or turned down\". The media interviews were the team's way of reissuing that appeal for the fourth time, he said.Mr Seiger added: \"It's appalling that we are having to sit here today and putting him [Viswashkumar] through this.\"The people who should be sitting here today are the executives of Air India, the people responsible for trying to put things right.\"Please come and sit down with us so that we can work through this together to try and alleviate some of this suffering.\"In a statement, the airline, which is owned by Tata Group, said senior leaders from the parent company continue to visit families to express their deepest condolences.\"An offer has been made to Mr Ramesh's representatives to arrange such a meeting, we will continue to reach out and we very much hope to receive a positive response,\" it said.The airline told the BBC that this offer was made before the media interviews with Mr Ramesh.More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoIsaac AsheLeicesterJulia WandeltUnder cross-examination on Thursday, Julia Wandelt tearfully asked \"why am I here?\" Two women's alleged stalking of the McCanns was \"cruel and unforgiving\" and showed no sign of stopping, prosecutors told a trial.Michael Duck KC said evidence showed Polish national Julia Wandelt, who has claimed to be missing Madeleine McCann since 2022, was \"capable of being incredibly manipulative\".Addressing the jury at Leicester Crown Court, he said Karen Spragg, 61, who helped arrange a doorstep confrontation at the McCanns' home to ask for a DNA test, was \"no sidekick\" and been a \"willing participant\" with a \"preconceived notion\" of the unsolved disappearance in Portugal in 2007.Both deny stalking Gerry and Kate McCann causing serious alarm and distress over two-and-a-half years.A letter Mr Duck said was \"co-authored\" by the two defendants, signed by Miss Wandelt as Madeleine and hand delivered to the McCanns' address in December 2024, a day after they were told to stop trying to contact them, showed the pair's \"torment\" of the family \"was not going to stop\".He said any suggestion having a DNA test carried out would have ceased their stalking was \"a nonsense\".Mr Duck pointed to Miss Wandelt's refusal to accept \"the game was finally up\" when told about the DNA result in April this year.When he suggested Miss Wandelt's supposed childhood memories as Madeleine McCann were \"a manifestation\" and details came from the McCann's home videos which were published online, Miss Wandelt became emotional and left the dock in tears.He also highlighted a shift from signing messages as Madeleine and calling Mrs McCann \"mommy\" to Mrs Spragg messaging Mrs McCann to say Miss Wandelt only \"believes she may be\" the missing girl.PA MediaThe court has heard Karen Spragg drove Miss Wandelt from Cardiff to Rothley on 7 December 2024He said: \"These two operated together, and had an ability and a willingness to manipulate.\"It's absolutely plain there never was and never could be evidence that supported their belief based on nothing other than her own assertions.\"Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann, and the only people who are not prepared to accept that are the two sat in the dock.\"PA MediaThe disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 has never been solvedAddressing the jury, judge Mrs Justice Cutts KC said that anyone with opinions on the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007 should \"put them to one side\" and solely consider evidence heard during the trial.She added both defendants are of previous good character, with just one prior caution on Mrs Spragg's record from 2006 for slapping a neighbour on the back of their head during an argument.'A genuine person'The best friend of Karen Spragg told the trial the 61-year-old was \"sincere, reliable and most definitely honest\".A character reference from care worker Susan Aherne, Karen Spragg's friend of 40 years, was read to the court telling of a \"genuine person\" who would \"listen wholeheartedly and give support\".Julia Wandelt, 24, of Jana Kochanowskiego in Lubin, Poland, and Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road, Cardiff, deny stalking the McCanns causing distress and alarm between June 2022 to February 2025.The trial continues.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "He made his money selling camels and gold. Now this warlord controls half of Sudan19 minutes agoAlex de WaalAfrica analystAnadolu via Getty ImagesMohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as \"Hemedti\", has emerged as a dominant figure on Sudan's political stage, with his paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) now controlling half of the country.The RSF scored a notable victory recently when it overran the city of el-Fasher, the last garrison held by the Sudanese army and its local allies in the western region of Darfur.Feared and loathed by his adversaries, Hemedti is admired by his followers for his tenacity, ruthlessness, and his promise to tear down a discredited state.Hemedti has humble origins. His family is from the Mahariya section of the camel-herding, Arabic-speaking Rizeigat community that spans Chad and Darfur.He was born in 1974 or 1975 - like many from a rural background, his date and place of birth were not registered.Led by his uncle Juma Dagolo, his clan moved into Darfur in the 1970s and 80s, fleeing war and seeking greener pastures and were allowed to settle.After dropping out of school in his early teens, Hemedti earned money trading camels across the desert to Libya and Egypt.At the time, Darfur was Sudan's wild west - poor, lawless and neglected by the government of then-President Omar al-Bashir.Arab militiamen known as the Janjaweed - including a force commanded by Juma Dagolo - were attacking the villages of the indigenous Fur ethnic group.This cycle of violence led to a full-scale rebellion in 2003, in which Fur fighters were joined by Masalit, Zaghawa and other groups, saying they had been ignored by the country's Arab elite.In response, Bashir massively expanded the Janjaweed to spearhead his counter-insurgency efforts. They quickly won notoriety for burning, looting, raping and killing. Getty ImagesThe atrocities of the Janjaweed militia caused international outrageHemedti's unit was among them, with a report by African Union peacekeepers saying it attacked and destroyed the village of Adwa in November 2004, killing 126 people, including 36 children.A US investigation determined that the Janjaweed were responsible for genocide. The Darfur conflict was referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which brought charges against four men, including Bashir, who has denied carrying out genocide. Hemedti was one of the many Janjaweed commanders deemed too junior to be in the prosecutor's sights at that time. Just one, the Janjaweed \"colonel of colonels\", Ali Abdel Rahman Kushayb, was brought to court. Last month he was found guilty on 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and he will be sentenced on 19 November.In the years following the height of the violence in 2004, Hemedti played his cards skilfully, rising to become head of a powerful paramilitary force, a corporate empire, and a political machine.It is a story of opportunism and entrepreneurship. He briefly mutinied, demanding back-pay for his soldiers, promotions and a political position for his brother. Bashir gave him most of what he wanted and Hemedti rejoined the fold.Later, when other Janjaweed units mutinied, Hemedti led the government forces that defeated them, in the process taking control of Darfur's biggest artisanal gold mine at a place called Jebel Amir.Rapidly, Hemedti's family company Al-Gunaid became Sudan's largest gold exporter.In 2013, Hemedti asked - and got - formal status as head of a new paramilitary group, the RSF, reporting directly to Bashir.The Janjaweed were folded into the RSF, getting new uniforms, vehicles and weapons - and also officers from the regular army who were brought in to help with the upgrade.AFP via Getty ImagesThe RSF was an ally of the army, before they fell outThe RSF scored an important victory against the Darfur rebels, did less well in fighting an insurgency in the Nuba Mountains adjacent to South Sudan, and took a subcontract to police the border with Libya.Ostensibly curbing illicit migration from Africa over the desert to the Mediterranean, Hemedti's commanders also excelled in extortion and, reportedly, people-trafficking.In 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called on the Sudanese army to send troops to fight against the Houthis in Yemen.The contingent was commanded by a general who had fought in Darfur, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, now the head of the army at war with the RSF. Hemedti saw a chance and negotiated a separate, private deal with both Saudi Arabia and the UAE to provide RSF mercenaries. The Abu Dhabi connection proved most consequential. It was the beginning of a close relationship with the Emirati president, Mohamed bin ZayedYoung Sudanese men - and increasingly from neighbouring countries too - trekked to the RSF recruiting centres for cash payments of up to $6,000 (£4,500) on signing up. Hemedti struck a partnership with Russia's Wagner Group, receiving training in return for commercial dealings, including in gold. He visited Moscow to formalise the deal, and was there on the day that Russia invaded Ukraine. After the war in Sudan broke out, he denied the RSF was getting help from Wagner.Although the RSF's main combat units were increasingly professionalised, it also encompassed a coalition of irregular old-style ethnic militia.As the regime faced mounting popular protests, Bashir ordered Hemedti's units to the capital Khartoum. Punning on his name, the president dubbed him himayti, \"my protector\", seeing the RSF as a counterweight to potential coup makers in the regular army and national security.It was a miscalculation. In April 2019, a vibrant camp of civic protesters surrounded the military headquarters demanding democracy.Bashir ordered the army to open fire on them. The top generals - Hemedti among them - met and decided to depose Bashir instead. The democracy movement celebrated.AFP via Getty ImagesThe RSF leader turned on then-President Omar al-Bashir, helping to depose himFor a time, Hemedti was lionised as the fresh face of Sudan's future. Youthful, personable, actively meeting diverse social groups, and positioning himself as the challenger to the country's historic establishment, he tried to change his political colours. That lasted just a few weeks.As he and the joint head of the ruling military council, Burhan, stalled on handing power to civilians, the protesters stepped up their rallies, and Hemedti unleashed the RSF, which killed hundreds of people, raped women, and threw men into the River Nile with bricks tied to their ankles, according to a report by campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW).Hemedti has denied the RSF committed atrocities.Pressed by the quartet of countries formed to promote peace and democracy in Sudan - the US, UK, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - the generals and the civilians agreed to a compromise drafted by African mediators.For two years, there was an unstable coexistence of a military-dominated sovereign council and a civilian cabinet.A simple guide to the war in Sudan'I was accused of spying and beaten' - a boy's escape from captured Sudan cityNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityAs a cabinet-appointed committee investigating the companies owned by the army, security and RSF closed in on its final report - which was set to expose how Hemedti was fast expanding his corporate empire - Burhan and Hemedti dismissed the civilians and took power.But the coup-masters fell out. Burhan demanded that the RSF come under army command. Hemedti resisted. Days before a deadline in April 2023  to resolve this issue, RSF units moved to surround the army headquarters and seize key bases and the national palace in the capital, Khartoum.The putsch failed. Instead, Khartoum became a war zone as the rival forces fought street by street. Violence exploded in Darfur, with RSF units mounting a vicious campaign against the Masalit people.The UN estimates as many as 15,000 civilians died, and the US described it as genocide. The RSF denied the allegation.RSF commanders circulated videos of their fighters torturing and killing, advertising the atrocities and their sense of impunity. The RSF and its allied militia rampaged across Sudan, pillaging cities, markets, universities, and hospitals. An avalanche of looted goods are for sale in what are popularly known as \"Dagolo markets\" reaching beyond Sudan into Chad and other neighbouring countries. The RSF has denied its fighters are involved in looting.Trapped in the national palace under attack from artillery and airstrikes, Hemedti was badly injured in the early weeks of the conflict and disappeared from public view. When he reappeared months later he showed no remorse for atrocities and was no less determined to win the war on the battlefield.ReutersThe war in Sudan has forced millions of people to flee their homesThe RSF has acquired modern weapons including sophisticated drones, that it has used to strike Burhan's de facto capital, Port Sudan, and which played a crucial role in the assault on el-Fasher. Investigative reporting by, among others, the New York Times, has documented that these are transported through an airstrip and supply base built by the UAE just inside Chad. The UAE denies that it is arming the RSF. With this weaponry, the RSF is locked in a strategic stalemate with its former partner, the Sudanese army. Hemedti is trying to build a political coalition, including some civilian groups and armed movements, most notably his former adversaries in the Nuba Mountains.He has formed a parallel \"Government of Peace and Unity\", taking the chairmanship for himself.With the capture of al-Fasher, the RSF now controls almost all the inhabited territory west of the Nile. Following escalating reports of mass killings and widespread condemnation, Hemedti declared an investigation into what he called violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of el-Fasher.Sudanese speculate that Hemedti sees himself either as president of a breakaway state, or still harbours ambitions to rule all of Sudan.It's also possible that he sees a future as an all-powerful political puppet master, head of a conglomerate that controls businesses, a mercenary army and a political party. By these means, even if he isn't acceptable as Sudan's public face, he can still pull the strings.And as Hemedti's troops massacre civilians in al-Fasher, he is confident that he enjoys impunity in a world that does not care much.Alex de Waal is the executive director of the World Peace Foundation at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in the US.More about the conflict in SudanGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "8 hours agoCachella Smith, Maia Davies, Amy Walker and Ruth ComerfordGetty ImagesPassengers travelling from Doncaster to London were attacked in a mass stabbing on a train on Saturday night.Eleven people received treatment in hospital following the attack. One - a member of the train staff - is in a \"critical but stable condition\".Two British men in their 30s were initially arrested while police said there was  \"nothing to suggest\" it was a terror incident.Anthony Williams, 32, from Peterborough was charged on Monday with 10 counts of attempted murder.The other man arrested has been released with no further action.Witnesses reported that police used a Taser on one man who was holding a knife.Cambridgeshire police are reviewing three further incidents, including the stabbing of a 14-year-old in Peterborough, to establish whether there is a connection between them and the Huntingdon train attack. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the attack was \"appalling\" and \"deeply concerning\", while the King and Queen sent their \"deepest sympathy\" to those affected.Thanking the emergency services and bravery of the those onboard in the House of Commons on Monday,  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the man who committed the crime was \"the very worst of humanity\".Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said police should be allowed to \"triple\" the use of stop and search to apprehend people carrying knives. Here is what we know so far.Follow live updates on this storyWatch: Police rush to scene of train stabbings'I looked at my hand and it was covered in blood': Passengers recall attackWhat do we know about the man charged?Mr Williams, 32, has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, one count of actual bodily harm (ABH) and one count of possession of a bladed article following the knife attack, BTP said on Monday morning.Police said he has also been charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a bladed article in connection with an incident at Pontoon Dock DLR station in the early hours of the same day. The ABH charge is in connection to an alleged assault in a custody suite on a police officer that allegedly resulted in a broken nose for the officer, following the incident at Huntingdon.Williams, of no fixed abode, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded in custody.He is due to appear at Cambridge Crown Court on 1 December.SuppliedAn image passed to the BBC by someone who witnessed last night's attack appears to show a suspect being apprehended by police. The red circle outlines the person on the ground behind a set of binsWhere did the stabbings happen?The attack took place on the 18:25 GMT London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service from Doncaster, South Yorkshire to London's King's Cross station.Passengers said one person brandishing a knife began stabbing people on the train after it passed through Peterborough in Cambridgeshire.Cambridgeshire Police received the first call from passengers on board at 19:39, and the British Transport Police (BTP) was also alerted at 19:42.The train made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon, which is around 15 minutes from Peterborough by train.Armed police boarded the train and arrested the two men within eight minutes of the call to BTP. Police later said a knife was recovered from the scene.A large emergency service response, including air ambulances, attended.The driver of the train, who has since been identified as Andrew Johnson - a former Chief Petty Officer in the Royal Navy - contacted the control room from his cab to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.It meant the train could stop at a platform in Huntingdon.Uninjured passengers were interviewed by police and some boarded a coach bound for London.Huntingdon MP Ben Obese-Jecty told the BBC there were about 10 ambulances, several fire engines and \"well over 20 police cars\" when he first arrived at the scene just after 21:00.National Rail said the station would remain closed until the end of the day on Monday.The empty train was seen at the platform on Sunday along with a police presence and forensics tents.Getty ImagesEmergency crews and police rushed to Huntingdon station in Cambridgeshire after 999 calls from the London-bound trainWas he linked to the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy? Cambridgeshire police are reviewing three further incidents to establish whether there is a connection between them and the Huntingdon train attack.On Friday evening, according to police, a man was seen with a knife at a barbers in Fletton, Peterborough, but the incident was reported two hours after the occurrence. A \"crime was raised\" but no officers were sent.Police are investigating whether a second incident on Friday evening, in which a 14-year-old was stabbed by a man may also be linked to the train attacksThis happened at 19:10 on Friday, police said, and the victim was taken to Peterborough City Hospital with minor injuries and later discharged.On Saturday morning, a second incident was reported by the same barbers with the perpetrator still at the scene, police said. Officers were deployed to the location, and arrived within 18 minutes but were unable to locate the man or identify him and another \"crime was raised\". Cambridgeshire police said it has referred itself to the police watchdog for scrutiny of the events. The BBC has obtained a picture of Williams in a barbershop in Peterborough, the evening before the train attack. What do we know about the victims?Emergency crews took 10 people to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge - which is some 30 minutes away from the train station - and one person later went to the hospital for treatment. Shortly before 18:00 on Sunday, police said five people had been discharged from hospital and one remained in a \"life-threatening condition\".\"This casualty is a member of LNER rail staff who was on the train at the time and tried to stop the attacker,\" the police said.\"Detectives have reviewed the CCTV from the train and it is clear his actions were nothing short of heroic and undoubtedly saved many people's lives.\"The driver has been identified as Andew Johnson, who said the action he took was \"the same as any other driver\"\"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery.\"The 10 people whose attempted murder Mr Williams is charged with include Jonathan Gjoshe, a Scunthorpe United footballer, who was slashed across the bicep and was operated on in hospital, his club said. Another victim, Stephen Crean told the BBC he \"tussled\" with the attacker, and was slashed him on the head and hand. His left hand is heavily bandaged. On Monday morning, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast the staff member was \"in hospital in a critical but stable condition\".She added that \"the bravery that he showed was utterly remarkable\" after putting himself \"in harms way\".\"There are people who are alive today who wouldn't be… were it not for his actions.\"Alexander also described passengers \"hiding in the toilet cubicles\" and other carriages as the attack unfolded.What have eyewitnesses said?Getty ImagesForensics officers were at the scene on Sunday inspecting the empty train on the platformWitnesses told the BBC of panic and confusion as passengers ran through the carriages, some wounded and bloodied.Alistair Day, 58, told the BBC he hid in the buffet car with about 11 other passengers while the attacker attempted to gain entry.He said one passenger turned to him and calmly said he had been stabbed in the chest: \"He had blood all over him, so we put pressure and stuff and held him.\"Olly Foster said he heard people shouting \"run, there's a guy stabbing literally everyone and everything\" and thought at first it might have been a Halloween prank.He saw an older man with gashes on his head and neck after he \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl. Passengers used their jackets to try and stanch the bleeding.\"Run, there's a guy stabbing everyone\": Eyewitnesses describe attackNottingham University student Amira Ostalski was on the train with her friend.She said when they got off the train as it came to a stop at Huntingdon she thought she would be safe but then she noticed the man - thought to be the attacker - jumping over a fence and running towards them.\"Police came and detained him right in front of my eyes,\" she said. Ms Ostalski added she would feel \"vulnerable\" if she were to sit on a train again.Watch: Police rush to scene of Cambridgeshire train attackReutersObjects scattered across the station floor appeared to include belongings and medical suppliesWhat is happening with train services? LNER urged passengers to check before travelling on Monday due to possible cancellations or changes to services between London Kings Cross and Peterborough.Tickets for Saturday and Sunday will be valid until Friday, and those who no longer want to travel this week can get a refund.Huntingdon station will remain closed until the end of Monday, LNER said, adding that a rail replacement bus service was in operation.

    "body": "'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved lives7 hours agoRachael McMenemyAndrew Johnson/FacebookAndrew Johnson, a LNER train driver, pictured at a Royal British Legion stallTrain staff and passengers have been praised for their heroic actions during a mass stabbing on a train which left multiple people injured. A train crew member, who is in a critical but stable condition in hospital, has been hailed a \"hero\" whose actions saved lives, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said. \"On Saturday, he went to work to do his job – today, he is a hero, and forever will be,\" she told Parliament earlier.Police met the Doncaster-London King's Cross train as it made an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, shortly before 20:00 GMT on Saturday.Anthony Williams, 32, gave his address as \"no fixed abode\" when appearing in court on Monday, where he was charged with 10 counts of attempted murder and remanded into custody.Crew members saved livesMahmood paid tribute to the \"breathtaking bravery\" of those \"on the train\" including the \"heroic acts of the passengers and train crew who intercepted the attacker\".She told Parliament that one member of the crew onboard  \"ran towards danger\" and confronted the man wielding a knife.His actions stopped the attacker from advancing through the train, she said.\"He put himself in harm's way, suffered grievous injuries as a result, and remains in hospital today, in a critical but stable condition,\" she added. Parliament TVHome Secretary Shabana Mahmood says her \"thoughts are with the victims, their friends and family and all those who experienced the terrifying attack\"MPs have also praised the quick reaction of train driver Andrew Johnson, a former  Royal Navy officer.Mr Johnson contacted the control room to get the train diverted from the fast track to the slow track when the alarm was raised.It meant the train could stop in Huntingdon, which allowed emergency services to quickly access the scene.Mr Johnson said: \"As train drivers, we hold a lot of responsibility. We practise our emergency response and keep up to date with our knowledge of the route, so if needed, we know exactly where to stop and what to do.\"He continued: \"The action I took is the same as any other driver. \"I think my colleagues onboard were the real heroes and I'd like to pay tribute to their bravery.\"David Horne, the managing director at LNER, said: \"Andrew's actions are testament to the expertise and skills he has built over his career, both on the railway and in the military.\"The intensive training undertaken by our drivers means they are always ready to respond in any situation.\"'Do you want to die?'Stephen CreanStephen Crean tried to block the attacker from getting into the buffet car, where people were hidingPassenger Stephen Crean, a Nottingham Forest football fan, is also being hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, who slashed him on the head and the hand.He saw fellow passengers running to the buffet car and wanted to make sure they could stay safely barricaded there.Mr Crean told the BBC's Lucy Manning the attacker shouted \"Do you want to die?\" at him.\"I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked. But then he pulled this thing out. It was an over-large blade.\"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. \"And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and caught me on the head.\"Crean said it was nice to hear that people are calling him a hero, but he thinks there were also other heroes at the scene.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train, and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably the real heroes. \"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"Whiskey bottle\"Run there's a guy stabbing everyone\" - witnesses describe attackWitnesses have described seeing fellow passengers attempt to protect each other, while others stemmed bleeding from wounds while they waited for help.Olly Foster, a passenger on the train, told the BBC he initially heard people shouting \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and believed it might have been a Halloween related prank.He said within minutes, people started pushing through the carriage, and he noticed his hand was \"covered in blood\" as there was \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on.An older man \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck, Mr Foster said.Passengers around him used jackets to try to staunch the bleeding.He added that the only thing people in his carriage could use against the attacker was a bottle of whiskey, leaving them \"staring down the carriage\" and \"praying\" that he would not enter the carriage.Although it lasted 10-15 minutes in total, Mr Foster said the incident \"felt like forever\".Describing the scene when he got off the train, he said: \"There were three people bleeding severely. One guy was holding his stomach and there's blood coming from his stomach and going down his leg. \"He was going 'help, help, I've been stabbed'.\"'You need to run'PAThe incident prompted a huge response by the emergency servicesJoe, who was also travelling back from the Nottingham Forest v Manchester United match, said the scenes were \"like something out of a movie\".The 24-year-old, from Peckham in south-east London, said: \"I was texting my friends about my plans for that night and then people came rushing through from the carriage, running through, saying, 'You need to run, you need to run'.\"At first it didn't really register what was going on.\"And then quickly, I just dropped my stuff and I started running along with them.\"And then I looked back, and I could see this guy - he was quite a tall, black male, and he had a bloodied knife.\"You just looked around and there was blood just everywhere.\"'What if we run out of carriages?'Joe continued: \"We kept moving through the train. We could see him behind us coming through.\"The scariest thing was that I knew that because the stops at this stage of the journey are just Stevenage and King's Cross there's quite a lot of big distances between stops.\"So we had no idea how long we were going to be on the train for.\"The thing that was in my mind was we're running through this train now but what if we run out of carriages to run through? What if we reach the end of the train? What happens there?\"It all happened very quickly. I was just in a fight or flight mode really.\"He ran right towards us... we decided to hide in a taxi', says eyewitness'Panic'Steve was on the King's Cross-bound train with his two children. The family were at the opposite end of the train to where the attack unfolded, but reflected on a \"nightmare scenario\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4, he said: \"We got on it [the train] about 19:10. We had just departed Peterborough, and then kind of an alarm went off, a kind of a soft alarm went off, which I heard before on the train.\"It said that, you know, an activation alarm has been activated in coach J.\"I didn't know what it was, but then we suddenly started seeing people massing at the end of the carriage by the door... I wasn't really sure what was going on.\"And then people started to get panicky.\"Someone said, 'there's been a stabbing'. And then people started to move quite quickly down towards our carriage.\".He continued: \"A woman came over the tannoy and said, 'we are aware there is an incident. Just keep yourself safe', which was scary to hear, because you didn't know what was going on.\"Then we pulled into a station. I think everybody assumed it was Stevenage, because that was the next scheduled stop.\"Everyone just started to kind of run and then pile off the train, and then everyone just, there's a bit of a panic, and everyone ran through the station forecourt.\"We ran out into the car park and ran up a hill and kind of out on to the road, and then we bumped into two or three young girls.\"We ran to someone's house, and we hammered on all the doors and pressed the buzzers, and we got in, and some very kind, early-elderly couple looked after us until it was safe to leave.\"The kids are very shaken up by it, but dealing with it very well.\"Joe Giddens/PAPA MediaThe incident took place at 19:42 on Saturday and British Transport Police (BTP) received reports of multiple stabbings aboard the 18:25 LNER service from Doncaster to King's CrossThe train's only other scheduled stop before King's Cross was due to be at Stevenage.Wren Chambers, who was due to get off in the Hertfordshire town, said they first became aware something was wrong when a man bolted down the carriage with a bloody arm, saying \"they've got a knife, run\".Wren said they and a friend ran to the front of the train and saw a man who had collapsed on the floor. Wren said they felt \"stressed and pretty scared\" once they knew what was happening, but they were eventually able to get off the train unharmed.\"There was quite a lot of blood on the train, there was some on my bag, some on my jeans,\" they told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"As soon as the train stopped and people got off most of them ran outside trying to get away from it, because we knew the attacker was still inside on the train.\"London Underground worker Dean McFarlane told the BBC that he saw the train pull into Huntingdon railway station at 20:00 with a passenger bleeding.He said that on arrival, he saw multiple people running down the platform bleeding, with one man in a white shirt \"completely covered in blood\".He said he grabbed people and told them to leave the station, and tried to assist passengers who he believed were having panic attacks.More on this storyRelated internet links ",

    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge8 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a key-note speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the west, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the United States had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation, and his, had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules, a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the United States to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the Imperial Citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the Barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity… And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at Davos last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a WhatsApp group that included Vice President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were \"insulting and frankly appalling\"We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the United States from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the United States will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have, ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention, to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength: a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's Prime Minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu\".Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Colombia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the United States, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial Shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing president Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them: the US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the Doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"In the Guatemala coup, in 1954, that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the United States would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary General of Nato Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president had receivedBut Trump's approach to towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden also believed the European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act: in response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around two per cent of GDP to five per cent, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos he said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I too make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, AI.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder: democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena; they are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "53 minutes agoOttilie MitchellPA MediaThe Met Police say they have detained a group of protesters who \"breached prison grounds\" at Wormwood Scrubs jail in west London on Saturday evening.The group were demonstrating in support of an alleged Palestine Action prisoner on hunger strike, the Met said, and are alleged to have threatened police and stopped prison staff from entering and exiting.The Prisoners for Palestine campaign group identified the inmate as Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, who they say began a thirst strike on Friday. He is awaiting trial over a break-in at RAF Brize Norton last June. He denies the charges.The Met has said all those involved will be arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass after refusing to leave.\"A number managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building,\" the Met said, but did not provide the number of arrests.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that \"at no point was prison security compromised\" and called the action an \"escalation\" that was \"completely unacceptable\".\"While we support the right to peacefully protest, reports of trespassing and threats being made to staff and police officers are deeply concerning,\" they said.Prisoners for Palestine said there had been \"at least 20 arrests\". The group said Khalid has limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a genetic condition, and was on an \"extremely dangerous\" thirst strike.More from the BBC",

    "body": "The Sunday Telegraph leads on what it calls Labour's \"civil war\" after Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham declared his intention to run in an upcoming by-election. The paper says there is growing support for Burnham as he targets a return to Westminster, and potentially a challenge to Sir Keir Starmer. \"Heated rivalry\" reads the Observer's headline. Its front page features a photo of the prime minister and Andy Burnham smiling at each other. The Independent also has a picture of the two men, this time looking less pleased in each other's company. The paper says Labour's division has been \"laid bare\". The Mail on Sunday says the choice to either block Burnham from running or face a leadership challenge leaves \"the beleaguered\" Sir Keir \"cornered\". \"Burnham throws down gauntlet\" reads the Sunday Times's headline, while the Sunday Mirror declares it \"the battle for Labour\". Its editorial says the last thing the country needs is a wobbly government, and it hopes the two men can work together.The Times says scientists in California have reached a turning point in their ability to create life in the lab using artificial intelligence. The breakthrough, which builds complex genetic sequences more quickly, cheaply and accurately than existing methods, paves the way for creating personalised cancer vaccines in days, according to the paper. It warns the new technique must be properly regulated, as it could lead to new biological weapons and the creation of what it calls \"designer babies\".A former head of MI6 has warned that Russian spies will step up attacks against the UK as part of an \"undeclared war\" on the West, according to the Sunday Express. Sir Richard Dearlove said there had been a \"continual, gradual escalation\" in what he called \"grey warfare\" by Moscow against Nato countries.According to the Sunday Telegraph, a woman known to have stalked Prince Harry sat near him during his appearance at the High Court last week. The Prince was there for the opening of his privacy case against the publisher of the Daily Mail, and it's understood that court security officials were alerted to the woman's presence. A source close to the Duke of Sussex is quoted as saying there was nothing anyone could do as the High Court is a public building.President Trump's \"U-turn\" on comments about Nato allies in the Afghanistan war leads the Daily Star. Donald Trump's suggestion that allied troops stayed away from the front line during the conflict was met with widespread condemnation, including from the singer Sir Rod Stewart. In a nod to one of his hits, the paper's headline reads \"have I told you lately that I hate you?\"The Sunday Express says figures from the Department for Transport shows central London has the worst traffic jams in the country, with vehicles moving at just six-point-nine miles per hour on average. Outside the capital, Slough, Brighton and Reading were the worst affected areas.",

So we were in a little convoy of blown tyres.\"It was actually a moment when I thought we're not going to make it to the finish,\" she said.Luckily, the Germans had large equipment so they could change the Land Rover's tyres and helped make sure Kirk and Tait-Wright were on the final stretch to the finish line.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteKirk and Tait-Wright had to drive through a range of terrains, including sand dunes\"They helped us get back on our way, we set off but we still had 80 kilometres to do without any spares.\"The worry was then if we blew another tyre, that was it. That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "American climber Alex Honnold has successfully scaled a Taiwan skyscraper without a rope, harness or safety equipment. The building, named Taipei 101 for the number of its floors, stands at 508m (1,667ft) of steel, glass and concrete and is designed to resemble a stick of bamboo.Honnold is renowned for being the first person to climb El Capitan, the vertical granite cliff in California's Yosemite national park - also without ropes or safety gear. The climb was originally set to take place on Saturday but was delayed by wet weather.His ascent in Taiwan's capital was streamed live on Netflix, which said there would be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen. Honnold completed the climb in one hour and 31 minutes and celebrated the achievement with one word: \"Sick.\"His time more than halves the record of the only other person to scale the tower. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who called himself \"Spiderman\", made it to the top of Taipei 101 - at the time the world's tallest building - in four hours. He did so with ropes and a harness.Taiwan's Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim congratulated Honnold on the ascent, writing on X: \"I admit I would probably feel sick, too, barely able to watch.\" Honnold was greeted at the top of the building by his wife, who expressed concern for the wind and heat as he climbed.But there was another distraction during his ascent.As Honnold reached the 89th floor, fans cheered and waved, face to face but for the window with the man clinging to the building.Video of the moment was shared by Honnold and Netflix on Instagram, showing the climber continuing undeterred.Honnold has made many extreme climbs during his career. A documentary about his ascent of the 3,000 foot (915m) El Capitan, titled Free Solo, won an Academy Award.",

    "body": "Home bakery helps mum cope with 'timebomb illness'6 days agoJim Scottin Hetton-le-HoleBBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson said she had been inundated with support for her cake shedA mother who described her inoperable brain condition as a \"ticking timebomb\" said opening an \"honest\" bakery in a shed at her home was helping her to cope.Megan Jackson, from Hetton-le-Hole, Sunderland, bakes and displays her own treats with an honesty box, which trusts customers to pay the correct amount of money while unattended.The registered nurse, who is on maternity leave after having her son Albie, was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm - a swollen blood vessel - after suffering extreme headaches.She said baking was her \"coping mechanism\" and she was touched that hundreds of people had visited her shed. Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "Just nowDoug FaulknerandBilly Kenber,Political correspondentA decision on whether to allow Andy Burnham to run in an upcoming parliamentary by-election will be made by the Labour Party's ruling national executive committee later.The BBC has been told allies of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer may try to block the mayor of Greater Manchester from standing in Gorton and Denton due to concerns that he could mount a leadership challenge if he returns to Westminster.Announcing his application to return to the Commons, Burnham, a former cabinet minister under Gordon Brown, said he wanted to to back the Labour government \"not undermine it\".Several Labour MPs have reacted angrily to the suggestion he could be blocked from standing, with the NEC expected to meet at 11:00 GMT to make its decision.The seat in Greater Manchester is vacant after Andrew Gwynne stood down as an MP on health grounds on Friday.As a directly-elected mayor, Burnham has to get approval from Labour's ruling national executive committee before he can enter the race to be the party's candidate. It is a massive decision for the prime minister and his allies. The calculation is whether it is more damaging to block a popular mayor from running in what could be a difficult by-election in his area or to allow a leadership candidate to come to Westminster and potentially make a leadership challenge in a few months' time.All indications at the moment are that his supporters intend to try to block it when the NEC meets this morning. That they are willing to do that, and to take the political damage from the inevitable fallout, shows just how seriously they are taking the threat of Burnham or others challenging the prime minister for his job.In a letter published on social media to announce his intentions, Burnham said there was a \"direct threat to everything Greater Manchester has always been about from a brand of politics which seeks to pit people against each other\".He said he had left Westminster nearly a decade ago because he believed \"it wasn't working for people in our part of the world\" and that as mayor he had \"tried to pioneer a different way of doing things\".But he said he felt the \"need to go back\" as he believed similar changes were needed at a national level.There has been speculation that the prime minister could face a leadership challenge after the May elections, which will see votes take place in the Welsh Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and in some local councils in England.Burnham has been touted as a possible leadership contender but can only mount a challenge if he is an MP.He has insisted he would be in Parliament \"to support the work of the government\" and says he has assured the prime minister of this.Labour MPs are split on the issue, some think Burnham should be allowed to stand as a strong candidate but others think having to contest his mayoralty opens the door to Reform potentially winning that.London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said he should be allowed to be an MP if he wanted to be, while deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell said the by-election would be \"difficult\" and she wanted \"to make sure we are putting the best team out on the pitch week after week\".She called for Labour members to \"get behind Keir Starmer\", adding that she did not want to see the by-election develop into \"in-fighting and talking about ourselves\".Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said Burnham would be \"a massive asset\" in Parliament and that he hoped Gorton and Denton party members would have \"the option\" of selecting him as a candidate.But Health Secretary Wes Streeting was more cautious, saying there would be big questions to weigh up including what would happen if there was a mayoral election in Greater Manchester.If Burnham were to be selected and won the Gorton and Denton seat, he would have to resign as Greater Manchester mayor, triggering a new election for that role.Several Labour sources have said the NEC could block Burnham's application on the grounds that a mayoral election would be expensive for the party.It would also be costly for the taxpayer with the last mayoral election costing around £4.7m.The area of Gorton and Denton has traditionally voted Labour and the party won the seat in 2024 with a majority of 13,000.However, since then the party's popularity has declined and Labour could face challenges from Reform UK and the Green Party who came second and third at the general election.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe new body will buy technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all police forcesA new National Police Service is being created as part of police reforms in England and Wales, to take over counter-terror, fraud, and criminal gang investigations.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the NPS, dubbed a \"British FBI\", would deploy \"world class talent and state of the art technology to track down and catch dangerous criminals\".It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.Mahmood said policing was stuck \"in a different century\" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms which she will unveil on Monday.Other reforms announced recently include:The number of police forces in England and Wales will be \"significantly\" cutEvery police officer in England and Wales will have to have a licence to practiceThe NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.The Home Office said local police officers have been \"burdened\" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.In the past week, the home secretary has announced a number of sweeping changes to policing, having described the current structures as \"irrational\".Counter terror policing, led by the Metropolitan Police, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police, and National Roads Policing will also all be brought under the new organisation. Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security \"no matter where they live\", the Home Office said in a statement.It is not the first time police reforms have been described as a \"British FBI\". In 2006, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was nicknamed \"Britain's FBI\". The Coalition government later replaced this with the National Crime Agency (NCA), which was again dubbed \"Britain's FBI\".While the government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. Labour wants to shake up the police - but will that solve 'everyday crime epidemic'?Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said \"the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change\".He added: \"These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the changes \"must not come at the expense of local community policing\".He said: \"More top-down reorganisation risks undermining efforts to catch criminals and it delivers no real improvement on the ground.\"Mahmood has previously said the current policing structure is \"irrational\", announcing on Thursday that she intends to drastically cut police forces down from 43 to make way for 12 \"mega\" forces.And on Friday, the government announced details of a licence scheme for police officers, and increased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failing.The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that \"fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities\".The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.",

    "body": "The Liberal Democrats are calling on the government to start issuing \"war bonds\", a scheme the party says could raise up to £20bn to bolster the military. Under the plan, members of the public could loan the government money in the form of a bond which would run over a two-to-three year period and pay out the same interest as standard government bonds. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the bonds would \"give ordinary people the opportunity to contribute to Britain's security\". A spokesperson for the government said \"new debt instruments\" were kept under review but that they had to represent \"value for money\" and \"be consistent with wider fiscal objectives\". Calls to increase defence spending have intensified in recent years, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the election of US President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticised Nato countries for failing to spend enough on their military. The Labour government has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, at an estimated cost of an additional £6bn a year.It has also promised to raise levels to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge by Nato members last year. However, there have been reports in the Times and the Sun that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require £28bn more than has so far been allocated.The government had been due to publish its defence investment plan last autumn but there are suggestions it has been delayed due to concerns about cost.Earlier this month, the head of the Armed Forces Sir Richard Knighton said the UK was \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\".Setting out his party's proposal, Sir Ed said: \"Now is the moment to be clear-eyed about the threats facing Britain - Vladimir Putin is waging war in Europe while Donald Trump is tearing up the rules and alliances that keep us safe.He said Britain and its allies \"must rapidly strengthen our defences to deter the likes of Putin... it is much better to invest now in deterring a war than having to fight one\".The Liberal Democrats said the money raised from issuing bonds would be ring-fenced for defence and the investment would help deliver \"growth, jobs and higher revenues\" for the government \"which would partially offset the cost of additional debt servicing\".The party added the scheme would need to be accompanied by an overhaul of the Ministry of Defence procurement process, which has previously been criticised as wasteful. Their proposal, the party says, would be similar to the bonds scheme used during World War One and World War Two. Individual citizens could lend the government money, which would be paid back in six to 10 years with interest. By the end of 1945, the scheme had raised £1.754m.Posters encouraging members of the public to buy bonds - or national savings certificates - used slogans including \"lend to defend\" and \"feed the guns with war bonds\". Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investors AJ Bell, said: \"War bonds are a proven way of raising money to fund national defence spending, but they can burden a government with long-term debt. \"In theory, the public might demand a better rate of interest than they could get on cash in the bank to take up the bonds. \"While some people might think it is their duty to support the country, there will be others who treat such a bond in the same way as any type of investment.\" ",

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshPA MediaEsther Ghey's daughter Brianna Ghey was stabbed to death in 2023 by two teens who had viewed violent content onlineTwo bereaved mothers fear any delay to bringing in a social media ban for young people could mean \"more and more children being harmed\".It comes days after the Lords voted in favour of banning under-16s from using social media services such as TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook in a move similar to one imposed by Australia last year.Esther Ghey and Ellen Roome told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that Ofcom, the regulator monitoring online safety laws, is not doing a good enough job to protect kids.Ofcom, which brought in new rules last year to protect children from seeing harmful or inappropriate content online, said it is \"under no illusion there is still much more to do\".In a heavy defeat for the government on Wednesday, House of Lords peers supported the cross-party move by 261 votes to 150 - a majority of 111.It means the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill will have to be considered by MPs in the Commons.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall has announced a three-month consultation to consider the advantages and disadvantages of a social media ban.It will include exploring possible overnight curfews and actions to prevent \"doom-scrolling\", and will report back to the government in the summer.Ghey - whose 16-year-old daughter Brianna Ghey was murdered in a park in February 2023 by two children who planned their crime on social media apps - said more needed to be done.\"Whilst we're waiting more and more children are being harmed\", Ghey said.\"I've spoken to you before about my story with Brianna and how much she suffered\".Brianna spent many hours on social media and her mother previously said her daughter wanted to be famous on TikTok.She believes this contributed to her isolation and problems with her mental health in the period running up to Brianna's death. \"The last two years of her life were absolutely full of suffering and it is such a waste,\" Ghey said.\"We know that every single day 500 children are being referred to mental health services and we know that 97% of 12-year-olds own smartphones so we need to do something now.\"Australia began forcing social media firms to block users aged under 16 from having accounts on their platforms in December.It is a policy being closely watched by governments around the world - including in the UK.Australia's ban was justified by campaigners and the government as necessary to protect children from harmful online content and algorithms.Companies including Meta have said they agree more is needed to keep young people safe online, but do not think a blanket ban is the answer, with some experts raising similar concerns.Ellen Roome is one of five British parents suing TikTok over their children's deathsEllen Roome - another bereaved mother whose son Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney died taking part in a social media challenge - joined parents who have lost children in circumstances relating to online safety at a meeting with the technology secretary on Tuesday.The 49-year-old from Gloucestershire told the BBC: \"How much longer are we going to let children have unregulated access?\"I think how much longer are we going to let children have unregulated access, they have got access to everything and I just really think it needs to go, this whole thing of waiting and seeing and waiting,\" Roome told the programme.\"I just fundamentally think if this was a product, it would be taken off the road, it would be fixed and handed back to them. Tell you what, take it away.\"Roome is part of a group of parents suing TikTok in the US state of Delaware.Ofcom said since its new powers came into force last summer, it has \"launched investigations into more than 90 platforms\" and \"issued several fines\".\"As a result of our action, age checks to protect children from pornography and other harmful material are now widespread, several high-risk sites are blocked, while child sexual abuse material is being tackled more effectively,\" an Ofcom spokesman said.\"This is an industry that's been unregulated and unaccountable for more than 20 years, and so while significant progress is being made, we're under no illusion that there is much still to do.\"We will continue to work with urgency to drive change so that children in the UK enjoy a safer life online, and we remain grateful for the support and insights we receive from victims, survivors and bereaved families.\"",

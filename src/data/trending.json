    "body": "Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Hearts have an eight-point lead after nine games of the seasonByBBC Scotland's chief sports writer at TynecastleMaybe the time is nigh to reimagine what is possible and what is impossible in Scottish football. After this resounding Hearts win in what was deemed the biggest test of their mettle this season, talk of an era ending and a new one beginning may not be as outlandish as so many of us have been programmed into believing.For 40 years the Old Firm hegemony has held. Everybody has become a fatalist. If it wasn't Celtic, it was Rangers. Many - perhaps every - supporter in the land has long since resigned themselves to never seeing a team from outside the big Glasgow two winning the top league. It was just accepted, like night following day.Occasionally a pretender has exploded out of the blocks in early season, winning games, throwing shapes, threatening to upset the way of things, but they've always been cut down by the Glasgow goliaths. And now?Painfully early in the season, it's true. Only nine games played and 29 left to play, as Brendan Rodgers pointed out later, in a somewhat revealing comment about the way he sees the lay of the land. There's still time to catch up was his gist. This is new territory for the Celtic manager.'Hearts clearly best team in country'The evidence of our own eyes right now is that Hearts are clearly the best team in the country. That's all we can go on. They've beaten Celtic and Rangers and have beaten them well. They're out-playing, out-scoring and out-defending everybody.They won this game not just because of the effervescence of their attack and the holy trinity of Alexandrios Kyziridis, Lawrence Shankland and Claudio Braga - goalscorers and goal creators yet again - but also in their togetherness and work-rate and absolute desire and self-belief.On a day of noise and colour, Hearts fans goaded their counterparts with their own version of the Celtic Poznan - all linking together, backs to the pitch, bouncing up and down - when Shankland made it 3-1.They did that and more. Cheering every Hearts touch for a spell, belting out 'We shall not be moved' in other moments. Their every utterance was akin to a 'is this all you've got?' message to their visitors. And, yes, that was all Celtic had.Hearts have now scored three goals in three of their last four games and in five of the nine they've played in the Premiership. Against Celtic, they beat their seasonal average shots on target (seven as against a previous average of 5.7). Celtic's Kasper Schmeichel made more saves than in any other league game this season. It wasn't a rout, but it was emphatic. It was an answer to those wondering about Hearts' capacity to live up to the pressure of their biggest game of the season. They did that - and then some.Derek McInnes is building something weighty here. He knows it but he's got far too much savvy to crow about it. He's measured and meticulous and mightily impressive right now. Hearts are great to watch - and from McInnes you get a sense that there's a lot more to come. More new players arriving, others just coming back into the team after injury. Not bit-parters, but big-timers, or so he hopes.There were many moments that stuck in the mind's eye. The relentless nature of the way Hearts began the game, going at Celtic's jugular in a way that only teams with true belief really can.They got their reward with a goal, Dane Murray panicking and hoofing the ball into his own net instead of making a clearance that should have been routine.Celtic put it up to them in the 15 minutes that followed. They scored and should have scored again, but didn't. They'd regret it. You can't fake confidence. You either have it or you don't. The way Hearts roared back and won was the greatest illustration of their merits we've seen so far.And a signal of Celtic's weakness. Showing Kyziridis the inside and inviting him to have a crack is a fool's errand, but that's what they did and that's how they fell behind again.Making jumpy decisions when under the cosh is not the way to survive a trial at Tynecastle, but that's what Murray did when bringing down Braga for Shankland's penalty.In the preamble, Rodgers said that he was including Murray along with Colby Donovan and Jonny Kenny because sometimes youth has no fear. It did here. Murray was exposed and Kenny was a bystander.'Why shouldn't Hearts folk dream?'Media caption, Can Hearts win the title? Derek McInnes answersIf you were to forget that Hearts - or any other non-Old Firm club - are not supposed to win the league, you can only conclude that McInnes' side are the real deal and that Rodgers' huff and puff champions are in real trouble.They haven't looked this good since George Burley was in charge two decades ago, that particular Hearts challenge getting snuffed out not by the Old Firm but by the folly of the club's owner at the time, Vlad Romanov.Some might say it's unwise for Hearts folk to dream because it's too early in the campaign. But why not? Isn't football about dreaming of what might be? They've known plenty of misery in these parts in recent times. Telling a Jambo to calm down as their team strides into an eight-point lead at the top of the table is to be the worst kind of killjoy.They have not won the league since 1960. Long road ahead. Danger ahoy, no doubt. Pressure and injury and bumps on the way, but these are exhilarating times.And what might, just might, make it sustainable - is that the infrastructure of the club is everything that Celtic's and Rangers' is not.Highlights: Hearts v Celtic26/10/25It's solid. It's focused. It's underpinned by the money and wisdom of Tony Bloom, the Brighton chairman, who has invested £10m for a minority stake in the club.It's underpinned, also, by the work of Jamestown Analytics and their ability to find the likes of Kyziridis, an uncapped Greek who was playing in Slovakia, and Braga, who was operating in the second tier of Norwegian football.The club is now aligned on and off the pitch after many years of being a troubled place. Celtic and Rangers wouldn't mind such stability.People entrenched in Scottish football see things as they have always been and can never see them changing. Perhaps that view will still hold true at the end of the season. Perhaps. The fact there is a considerable doubt is exciting enough for now.People like Bloom, watching here from the stand, are a breath of fresh air. He's already said that Hearts can win the league in a decade. That kind of chat from an underdog is usually laughed off in Scotland. Usually.Tynecastle was alive on Sunday. Another test passed with flying colours. Glorious maroon, of course.Get in touchSend us your views on Hearts",

    "body": "Health leaders are warning that NHS services and jobs in England will have to be cut unless up to £3bn more in funding is allocated to cover unexpected costs. The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers, representing trusts and other health organisations, said in a joint statement that the cost of covering redundancies and strikes, along with paying more for medicines, was not included in the budget this year and will need extra cash from the Chancellor.Talks between the Department of Health and the Treasury are ongoing, Health Secretary Wes Streeting has confirmed. Responding to the statement, the Department of Health said the government was committed to \"properly funding\" the NHS.Cuts to NHS services and jobs could mean fewer tests, appointments and operations being carried out. Senior managers say that demands from the government for significant job cuts in regional health boards and NHS trusts have been made without any promise of extra funding to cover at least £1bn of redundancy payments. The merger of NHS England and the Department of Health will also involve staff reductions which have to be paid for.The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers say that the doctors' strike in England in July led to £300m of costs for NHS trusts, including covering rota gaps. The cost is likely to be the same again during the next planned strike in November, they claim. They go on to argue that a likely deal with the United States over higher medicine prices could cost the NHS around £1.5bn. The US administration and major pharmaceutical companies have been pushing the UK government to raise the amount paid for drugs. The drug companies argue that investment in UK research and development of new medicines could be cut if a deal is not agreed.Health leaders have also warned that progress on reducing waiting lists will be affected if there is no Treasury help in making up the financial shortfall. Some argue that uncertainty over redundancy plans is distracting staff and managers from the task of turning round the NHS.Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: \"The threat from un-budgeted redundancy payments, higher drug prices and renewed industrial action risks derailing progress on key waiting time targets and the wider reforms that are essential to getting the NHS back on track.\"Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \"Redundancies cost money, making it harder to make long-term savings without government support. \"As the government prepares its Budget it's time for an honest assessment and discussion about what the NHS can really achieve this year in these challenging financial circumstances - and about what is 'doable'' to meet ministers' ambitions in their 10-year plan for health.\"A Department for Health and Social care spokesperson said: \"This government has delivered a record-breaking £29 billion investment in our NHS – including up to £10 billion on digital and technology transformation and £750 million for urgent capital repairs – demonstrating our unwavering commitment to properly funding the health service that we all rely on.\"However investment alone isn't enough - it must go hand in hand with reform. That is why we're doing things differently: not just fixing the NHS but moving it forward through our Plan for Change\"",

They returned exhausted but delighted. Mission accomplished.\"Following a trial at the Old Bailey, Bravery was found guilty of attempted murder and was jailed in 2020 for at least 15 years.More on this story",

    "body": "Russia has tested the nuclear-powered Burevestnik cruise missile, Moscow's top general has said.\"We have launched a multi-hour flight of a nuclear-powered missile and it covered a 14,000km (8,700-mile) distance, which is not the limit,\" Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov told President Vladimir Putin in a televised meeting.The low-flying experimental weapon, first announced in 2018, has been hailed as having a potentially unlimited range and the ability to evade missile defences.Western experts have previously cast doubt over missile's strategic value and Russian claims of having successfully tested it.Putin said a \"final successful test\" of the weapon had been held in 2023, but the claim could not be independently verified. Of at least 13 known tests, only two had partial success since 2016, according to an arms control campaign group.Gen Gerasimov said the missile was in the air for 15 hours during the test on 21 October. He said the missile's vertical and horizontal manoevreing were tested and were found to be up to specification, according to Russia's Tass news agency.\"Therefore, it demonstrated high capabilities to bypass missile and air defence systems,\" Tass reported Gen Gerasimov as saying.The missile's utility has been the subject of intense debate in military and defences circles since it was first announced in 2018.A 2021 report by the US Air Force's National Air and Space Intelligence Center concluded: \"A nuclear-powered cruise missile would give Russia a unique weapon with intercontinental range capability.\"However, as the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) noted the same year, Russia faces significant challenges in making the weapon viable.\"Its entry into Russia's inventory arguably hinges not only on overcoming the considerable technical challenge of ensuring the reliable performance of the nuclear-propulsion unit,\" IISS analysts wrote.\"There have been numerous flight-test failures, and an accident resulting in several deaths.\"A Russian military journal quoted in the IISS report claims the missile has a range of between 10,000 and 20,000km, allowing \"the missile to be based anywhere in Russia and still be able to reach targets in the continental US\".The same journal also says the missile can fly as low as 50 to 100 metres above ground, making it difficult for air defences to intercept.The missile, code-named Skyfall by Nato, is thought to be powered by a nuclear reactor, which is supposed to activate after solid fuel rocket boosters have launched it into the air.An investigation by news agency Reuters last year identified a facility 475km (295 miles) north of Moscow as the likely launch site of the weapon.Using satellite imagery from August 2024, analyst Decker Eveleth told Reuters he had identified nine horizontal launch pads under construction at the site.",

    "body": "Food assistance used by more than 40 million Americans will not be distributed from November due to the ongoing US government shutdown, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the department said in a notice on its website, which also blamed Democrats in the Senate for the impasse.The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) is used by one in every eight Americans, and plays a vital role in many grocery budgets. Earlier this month, the Trump administration declined draw on a contingency fund that would have continued benefits, saying the money was needed for potential emergencies such as natural disasters.Democrats have condemned President Donald Trump for refusing to use the contingency fund.\"This is perhaps the most cruel and unlawful offense the Trump administration has perpetrated yet,\" Congresswomen Rosa DeLauro and Angie Craig said in a joint statement on Friday.They also criticised Trump for providing assistance to Argentina and building a new White House ballroom during the shutdown.According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), a think-tank focused on policies that help low-income families, the contingency fund would only cover about 60% of one month of benefits, however.In a letter sent to the agriculture department on Friday, Democratic House members said there was still \"significant funding available in Snap's contingency reserve – which Congress provides precisely for this reason – that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits\".They asked Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to release the reserves and then transfer other available money in her department to fully fund the programme for the month.In a memo obtained by US outlets, Rollins said the reserve can only be used for \"true emergencies\", mostly natural disasters.Earlier, in its published plan for the shutdown, her department had said it would keep a small number of employees from being furloughed to operate the programme, noting Congress had created \"multi-year contingency funds\" to ensure states could continue to distribute benefits.Snap works by giving people reloadable debit cards that they can use to buy essential grocery items.A family of four on average receives $715 (£540) per month, according to CBPP, which breaks down to a little less than $6 (£4.50) per day per person.The states administer the programmes, with much of the funding coming from the federal government. Several states have pledged to use their own funds to cover any shortfall, however the federal government has warned that they will not be reimbursed.Some, including Massachusetts - where one million people are expected to lose benefits - have said they do not have enough money to make up for the lack of funds.Many states are working with people in Snap to try locate charity food pantries and find alternative sources for meals, and California is deploying its National Guard to help distribute food. The US government shutdown entered its 26th day on Sunday, making it the second-longest shutdown in history.",

    "body": "7 hours agoThomas Mackintosh and Euan O'Byrne MulliganWatch: Kebatu expected to be deported this week, Lammy saysA migrant who was mistakenly released from prison and then re-arrested will be deported \"this week\", David Lammy has said.Hadush Kebatu was arrested in the Finsbury Park area of north London at 08:30 GMT on Sunday, bringing an end to a 48-hour manhunt that began after he was let go in error from HMP Chelmsford.Kebatu, who was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping while living in an asylum hotel, was due to be deported when he was mistakenly set free by prison staff.Justice Secretary Lammy said he would outline the terms of reference for a full independent inquiry into the release in Parliament on Monday.Earlier, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said an investigation was already under way, adding: \"We must make sure this doesn't happen again.\"Kebatu's initial arrest in July sparked protests outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, where he had been living since arriving in the UK on a small boat.The Met Police said Kebatu was arrested on Sunday on suspicion of being unlawfully at large and would be taken to a London prison.One eyewitness said he was walking his dog in Finsbury Park when he spotted Kebatu being led away by a number of officers.Eyewitness Jack Neill-Hall, 40, told the PA news agency: \"I knew that he'd last been seen in the Hackney area and I thought 'oh, that looks awfully like that guy, he's not wearing the same clothes but it looks like him'.\"\"He wasn't struggling, he was walking quite calmly, a bit dejectedly, he was staring down, he had his hood up, but it was a calm situation,\" he added.\"It was a leisurely stroll out of the park with him with his hands cuffed but he wasn't trying to get away.\"Watch: Moment Kebatu is arrested in Finsbury ParkThe Met said a member of the public tipped off police that they had spotted a man they believed could be Kebatu at a bus stop near Finsbury Park station at 08:03 on Sunday morning.Officers were sent to the area and found him 16 minutes later.Kebatu was seen being led away in handcuffs by police wearing different clothes to the prison-issue grey tracksuit he had last been spotted in on Friday evening. Essex PoliceHadush Kebatu posed a \"significant risk of reoffending\", the judge said during sentencingEssex Police were first made aware that Kebatu had been released in error on Friday at 12:57 on Friday but Kebatu had already boarded a train to east London 16 minutes earlier.Kebatu was also filmed in Chelmsford city centre speaking to members of the public shortly after he was released, and police confirmed he approached several people seeking assistance.The Met Police also established that Kebatu made a number of train journeys across the capital.Officers issued CCTV images of Kebatu at a library in the Dalston area on Friday evening. He was still wearing a prison-issue grey tracksuit and carrying a white bag with pictures of avocados on it.Met PoliceKebatu was picked up on CCTV inside a library in Dalston SquareIn September, Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard Kebatu tried to kiss a teenage girl on a bench and made numerous sexually explicit comments.The following day, he encountered the same girl and tried to kiss her before sexually assaulting her. He also sexually assaulted a woman who had offered to help him draft a CV to find work.Kebatu gave his age as 38 during a court appearance, but a judge said he had seen information indicating he was 41.He denied the charges against him but was found guilty of five offences last month and sentenced to 12 months in custody, including the time he had already spent in jail awaiting his trial. In total, he spent 108 days in prison.Kebatu was also given a five-year sexual harm prevention order, which banned him from approaching or contacting any female, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years.The father of the 14-year-old victim said Kebatu's mistaken release had caused her \"so much stress and anxiety\" and condemned the error as \"unbelievably irresponsible\".In a statement read out on his behalf by Shane Yerrell, an independent councillor at Epping Forest District Council, the father said his daughter feared seeing Kebatu and being recognised by him.Speaking earlier from Wood Green police station in north London, Lammy said Kebatu's victims had been contacted by police liaison officers over the last 48 hours. During his trial, the court heard it was Kebatu's \"firm wish\" to be deported. Under the UK Borders Act 2007, a deportation order must be made where a foreign national has been convicted of an offence and has received a custodial sentence of at least 12 months.Watch: 'Huge relief' that Kebatu has been arrested says StreetingHM Prison Service has instructed governors in England and Wales to implement additional checks before inmates are released by Monday.A prison officer has been suspended pending investigation but a senior prison staffer told BBC News the release was \"down to a series of mistakes probably because staff are overworked and in short supply\".They continued: \"It's not just one prison office who's to blame. That would be unfair.\"A report from His Majesty's Prison and Probation Service said 262 prisoners in England and Wales were released in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 in the previous 12 months.Asked why figures for wrongful releases were rising, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said the Labour government \"inherited a system that was collapsing [from the Conservatives]\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC the arrest was a \"huge relief\" and said Kebatu will \"now be deported\".He continued: \"The justice secretary has ordered an investigation into how on earth it was that a dangerous man who was due for deportation was instead released onto our streets. \"That work is under way, we will be open and transparent with the public about what went wrong and what we're going to do about it.\"He had earlier said the Prison Service was under enormous pressure \"but even against that backdrop it doesn't explain or excuse the release of people on our streets who have no business being there\".Former Conservative Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said an inquiry was necessary in order \"to learn lessons\", and suggested the incident was symptomatic of wider problems with the prison system.He told BBC Breakfast: \"The entire annual budget of the Ministry of Justice is spent by the Department for Work and Pensions in two weeks.\"My constant plea is to try to ensure the prison service gets the resources it requires to ensure we are recruiting and retaining people with skills and experience to make sure these problems don't happen.\"The Liberal Democrat MP for Chelmsford, Marie Goldman, said Kebatu \"must now be deported\" and also pushed for a national inquiry.Earlier, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the incident showed that the UK's \"once-trusted institutions\", including the police and prisons, were \"disintegrating before our eyes\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterReutersThe US and China have agreed the framework of a potential trade deal that will be discussed when their respective leaders meet later this week, the US treasury secretary has said.Scott Bessent told the BBC's US news partner CBS that this included a \"final deal\" on TikTok's US operations and a deferral on China's tightened rare earth minerals controls.He also said he did not anticipate the 100% tariff on Chinese goods threatened by US President Donald Trump coming into force, while China will resume substantial soybean purchases from the US.Both nations are seeking to avoid further escalation in a trade war between the world's two largest economies.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are due to hold talks on Thursday in South Korea.Bessent met senior Chinese trade officials on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, which Trump is also attending as part of a tour of Asia. Beijing said they had \"constructive\" discussions.Bessent said the countries had \"reached a substantial framework for the two leaders\", adding: \"The tariffs will be averted.\"The Chinese government said in a statement that both negotiating teams \"reached a basic consensus on arrangements to address their respective concerns\".\"Both sides agreed to further finalise specific details,\" they added.Trump's tariff tacticsSince Trump re-entered the White House, he has imposed and threatened sweeping tariffs on imports from overseas on various countries, arguing that the policy would help boost US manufacturing and jobs. The introduction of tariffs has resulted in many countries, including the UK, agreeing new deals with the US.But the steepest levies he has threatened have been levelled at China. Beijing has hit back with measures of its own, though the two agreed to hold off implementing the levies while pursuing a trade deal.However, earlier this month Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tarriff on Chinese goods from November in response to China tightening restrictions on export of rare earths - materials essential to the production of many electronics. The US president accused Beijing of \"becoming very hostile\" and trying to hold the world \"captive\".China processes around 90% of the world's rare earths, which go into everything from solar panels to smartphones, making supply of them to US manufacturers a key bargaining chip.The last time Beijing tightened export controls - after Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods early this year - there was an outcry from many US firms reliant on the materials.China will \"delay that for a year while they re-examine it\", Bessent told a different news show, This Week, on Sunday.Another issue of contention is soybeans, of which China is the world's biggest buyer. As the trade war began heating up, China halted all orders, hurting US farmers.Bessent hinted the boycott may soon be over but refused to give details.\"I'm actually a soybean farmer, so I have felt this pain too... I think we have addressed the farmers' concerns,\" he said on This Week.\"I believe when the announcement of the deal with China is made public that our soybean farmers will feel really good about what's going on for this season and the coming seasons for several years.\"TikTok deal done?Bessent also said a deal had been agreed on video-sharing platform TikTok's US arm, with Trump and Xi left to \"consummate that transaction on Thursday\".The US has sought to prise the app's US operations away from Chinese parent company ByteDance over national security concerns.TikTok was previously told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down, but Trump has delayed implementing the ban four times to facilitate negotiations, and has extended the deadline again to December.The White House announced last month that US companies would control TikTok's algorithm and Americans would hold six of seven board seats for the app's US operations.While Trump initially called for TikTok to be banned during his first term, he has since changed course. He turned to the hugely popular platform to boost his support among young Americans during his successful 2024 presidential campaign.On Sunday, Washington also annouced that trade deals with Malaysia and Cambodia had been secured and framworks agreed with Thailand and Vietnam.",

    "body": "Two arrested over theft of jewels at Louvre museum in Paris11 hours agoJake LaphamWatch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleTwo suspects have been arrested over the theft of precious crown jewels from Paris's Louvre museum, French media say.The Paris prosecutor's office said one of the men had been taken into custody as he was preparing to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle Airport.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum last Sunday, when four thieves wielding power tools broke into the building in broad daylight.France's justice minister has conceded security protocols \"failed\", leaving the country with a \"terrible image\".The Paris prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrests had been made on Saturday evening, without specifying how many people had been taken into custody.One of the suspects was preparing to travel to Algeria, police sources have told French media, while it is understood the other was going to Mali.Specialist police can detain and question them for up to 96 hours.According to reports in French media on Sunday, DNA found at the scene of the robbery led to the identification of one of the suspects. The gang left behind a number of items, including gloves and a high-vis jacket. It has previously been reported that they dropped a crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III.The Paris prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.The thieves reportedly arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), shortly after the museum opened to visitors.The suspects arrived with a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.Pictures from the scene showed the ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves entered by cutting through the window with power tools.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and cut through the glass of two display cases containing jewels.A preliminary report has revealed that one in three rooms in the area of the museum raided had no CCTV cameras, according to French media.French police say the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38.The museum's director told French senators this week that the only camera monitoring the exterior wall of the Louvre where they broke in was pointing away from the first-floor balcony that led to Gallery of Apollo.CCTV around the perimeter was also weak and \"ageing\", Laurence des Cars said, meaning that staff failed to spot the gang early enough to stop the theft.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumA tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen Experts have also expressed concern that the jewels may have already been broken up into hundreds of pieces.Gold and silver can be melted down and the gems can be cut up into smaller stones that will be virtually impossible to track back to the robbery, Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told the BBC. Security measures have since been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAndré Rhoden-Paul and Frank Gardner,Security correspondent , Jerusalem EPA/ShutterstockEgyptian equipment crosses into the Gaza StripTeams from Egypt and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have been allowed to search for bodies of deceased hostages taken during the 7 October attacks, Israeli authorities have confirmed.The Israeli government said the teams have been permitted to search beyond the so-called \"yellow line\" in the area controlled by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza.Separately on Sunday, Israeli media reported that Hamas members had also been allowed to enter the IDF-controlled area of Gaza to aid the search, alongside the ICRC teams.Hamas has transferred 15 out of 28 deceased Israeli hostages under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, which requires it to hand over all hostage bodies. The group said it is now coordinating with Egyptian authorities.Donald Trump has warned Hamas to start return the bodies \"quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action\".An Israeli spokesperson said the Egyptian team has been permitted to work with the ICRC to locate the bodies, and would use excavator machines and trucks for the search beyond the \"yellow line\". The \"yellow line\" marks the boundary running along the north, south and east of Gaza that Israel withdrew to, as part of the first stage of the ceasefire deal.  Until now, Israel has not approved the entry of such teams.Egypt, along with Qatar and Turkey, is a key signatory of the Trump-brokered Gaza peace plan, which was signed in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh earlier this month.The news will be welcomed by relatives, desperate to give them a proper burial. The ICRC has already been heavily involved in the return of hostages. Hamas does not hand over its captives - living or deceased - directly to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but rather to the ICRC, which in turn escorts them through Gaza and hands them on to the IDF. But the arrival of Egyptian excavation teams inside the Gaza Strip is new. Watch: Egyptian machinery claws through sand in Khan Younis as search for hostage bodies continuesAfter more than two years of intense bombardment by Israel, the UN estimates that as much as 84% of the territory has been reduced to rubble.Hamas says it is doing its best to retrieve hostage bodies, but it faces difficulty finding them under rubble of buildings bombed out by the Israeli military in Gaza. It is now coordinating with the Egyptian authorities. On Sunday, an Israeli government spokesperson said that Hamas knew where the bodies were. \"If Hamas made more of an effort, they would be able to retrieve the remains of our hostages,\" the spokesperson said.Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Saturday that action would be taken if the bodies of the deceased hostages were not returned quickly. \"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not. Perhaps it has do with their disarming,\" he said. Trump added: \"Let's see what they do over the next 48 hours. I am watching this very closely.\"Gaza children dying as they wait for Israel to enable evacuationsRubio says lots of countries willing to join Gaza security forceNew images show Israeli control line deeper into Gaza than expectedOn Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would determine which foreign forces it would allow as part of a planned international force in Gaza to help secure the ceasefire under Trump's plan. \"We are in control of our security, and we have also made it clear regarding international forces that Israel will determine which forces are unacceptable to us, and this is how we operate and will continue to operate,\" he said speaking at the start of a cabinet meeting.On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"a lot of countries\" had offered to be part of the force - but added Israel would have to be comfortable with participants.This appeared to be a reference to Turkey, amid reports Israel had vetoed the country's involvement. It remained unclear, however, how such a force could be deployed without an understanding with Hamas.Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages.At least 68,519 have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "How the nation lost its appetite for Pizza Hut 1 day agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterBBCPizza Hut was once a go-to for families and friends to tuck into its all-you-can eat buffet, unlimited salad bar, and self-serve ice-cream with all the toppings.But fewer diners are \"hitting the Hut\" these days and it is closing half its UK restaurants after being bought out of administration for the second time this year.\"We used to go to Pizza Hut when I was a child,\" says Prudence, when the BBC asked shoppers in London why they thought the chain was struggling. \"It was like a family thing, you'd go on a Sunday - make a day of it.\" But now aged 24 she says \"it's not a thing anymore\".For 23-year-old Martina Debnatch it is some of the very things Pizza Hut has been known and loved for since it opened in the UK in the 1970s that are now not-so-hot.\"The way they do their buffet and their salad bar, it feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards...They're giving away so much food and you're like 'How?'\"'It feels like they are cheapening on their quality and have lower standards,' says 23-year-old Martina DebnatchAs food prices have soared, Pizza Hut's all-you-can-eat model has become very expensive to run. As have its 132 restaurants which are being sliced to 64.The business, like many others, has also seen its costs increase. In April this year, staffing costs jumped due to rises in minimum wages (which went up nearly 7% this year, to £12.21 for employees aged 21 and over) as well as an increase in employer national insurance contributions.Chris, 36, and Joanne, 29 say they used to go to Pizza Hut for a date \"every now and then\", but now they order in a Domino's and think Pizza Hut is \"very overpriced\".Depending on your order, Pizza Hut and Domino's prices are similar, says Giulia Crouch, food expert and author of The Happiest Diet in the World.While Pizza Hut does offer takeaway and deliveries through Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat, it is losing out to big rivals which solely cater to this market.\"Domino's has managed to dominate the takeaway pizza sector thanks to aggressive marketing and constantly running deals that make consumers feel like they're getting a bargain, when in reality the original prices are quite high,\" says Ms Crouch.But for Chris and Joanne it is worth it to get their date night delivered to their door.\"We definitely eat at home now more than we eat out,\" says Joanne, echoing recent statistics that show a drop in people going to casual and fast-food restaurants. John Keeble/Getty ImagesCasual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers over the summer Over the summer, casual and fast-food restaurants saw a 6% drop in customers compared to last summer.There is also another rival to restaurant and takeaway pizzas: the cook-at-home oven pizza.Will Hawkley, head of leisure and hospitality at KPMG, points out that not only have supermarkets been offering high-quality oven-ready pizzas for years - some are even selling home-pizza ovens.\"Lifestyle changes are also playing a factor in the success of fast-food chains,\" says Mr Hawkley.The rising popularity of high protein diets has boosted sales at chicken shops, while hitting sales of carb-heavy pizza, he adds.As people go out to eat less frequently they may look for a more a premium experience and Pizza Hut's American-diner style with booth seating can feel more retro than upmarket.The \"explosion of high-quality pizzerias\" over the last 10 to 15 years, such as Franco Manca, has \"fundamentally changed the public's perception of what good pizza is,\" says Ms Crouch.\"A light, fresh, easy-to-digest product with a few choice toppings, not the massively greasy, heavy and overloaded pizzas of the past. That, I think, is what's caused Pizza Hut's downfall,\" she says.\"Why would anyone spend £17.99 on a small, substandard, disappointing pizza from a chain when you can get a beautiful, masterfully made Margherita for under a tenner at one of the many authentic Italian pizzerias around the country? \"It's a no-brainer.\"Dan Puddle, who owns Smokey Deez, a small mobile pizza van based in Suffolk says: \"It's not that people have fallen out of love with pizza - they just want better pizza for their money.\"Dan says his flexible operation can offer premium pizza at accessible prices, and that Pizza Hut struggled because it could not keep up with new customer habits.At Pizzarova, a small independent chain based in Bristol, owner Jack Lander says the pizza market is broadening but Pizza Hut has failed to offer anything new.\"You now have slice concepts, London pizza, new haven, sourdough, Neapolitan, Detroit - it's a heavenly minefield for a pizza-loving consumer to explore.\"Jack says Pizza Hut \"needs to reinvent itself\" as younger people don't have any sense of nostalgia or loyalty to the brand.Jack LanderJack Lander owns an independent pizza chain in BristolOver time, Pizza Hut's market has been sliced up and distributed to its trendier, more nimble rivals. To maintain its expensive staffing and restaurants, it would have to increase costs - which KPMG's Mr Hawkley says is difficult at a time when household budgets are shrinking.Nicolas Burquier, Pizza Hut's managing director of international markets, said the buyout aimed \"to safeguard our guest experience and protect jobs where possible\". He said its immediate priority was to continue operating at the remaining 64 restaurants and 343 delivery sites and to support colleagues through the transition.But with so much money going in to running its restaurants, it likely can't afford to invest too much in its delivery service because the sector is \"complex and partnering with existing delivery apps comes at a cost\", Mr Hawkley says .But, he adds, cutting its costs by leaving oversaturated towns and city centres could be a good way to adapt.More weekend picks",

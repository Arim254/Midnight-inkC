    "body": "Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu, 2026 slopestyle gold medallist Mathilde Gremaud and Canada's Megan Oldham. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

    "body": "The Scottish quartet were in command throughout against the Germans, leading 5-2 at the break before accelerating clear, but the hitherto unbeaten Swiss proved more obdurate opposition.Mouat's men led 3-2 at the break - a steal in the third proved the difference - and it took until the seventh end for either side to register a score greater than one.It was the Swiss who did it, to lead 4-3, but it all came down to the last end.Britain needed one to tie, two to win. They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"Earlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.The unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.Rebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.At least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics. You need to be at your best and we just weren't quite there.\"The women are back on the ice against Denmark (08:05 GMT) and Switzerland (18:05) on Monday, while the men face Norway (13:05).Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby safely progressed to the final round of the pairs figure skating after recording a season-best score.The duo, who are the first British representatives in this Olympic event since 2014, endured a troubled build-up to the Games after Digby suffered a wrist injury which limited their ability to practice lifts.And in the team event at the start of the Games, Vaipan-Law suffered a fall during their throw triple Salchow, meaning there were worries about whether they would finish in the top 16 of the short program – needed to qualify for the free skate.But they assuaged those doubts with a slick routine as Vaipan-Law landed the throw well before their final spin was synchronised perfectly.Digby was grinning even before their routine concluded, and was proven right as they scored 66.07, their highest score of the 2025-26 season.\"That little celebration at the end was me releasing all the emotion of it going exactly as I wanted it to,\" Vaipan-Law told the BBC.They qualify in 13th place, meaning they will perform fourth in the free skate tomorrow – and will aim to better their best World Championship finish of 12th.\"Seeing so many British flags, that energy gave us a little extra,\" said Digby. \"We kept our heads and we were nice and calm. A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"Germany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.European champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlex ForsythPolitical correspondentReutersThe government is aware it can't afford to get SEND reforms wrongIn the next few weeks, the government is expected to outline its plan to overhaul the crucial yet complex system of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in England - and it could prove contentious.The SEND system is vital to hundreds of thousands of parents and children in England.Almost every MP will tell you it's an issue that regularly tops their inboxes; last month, the prime minister acknowledged SEND was probably raised with him more than any other topic in the House of Commons.Given the strength of feeling, it's perhaps no surprise that some Labour MPs have been nervous about what the government is planning, mindful of previous missteps on issues of public concern like winter fuel payments and welfare.With the prime minister's authority and judgement having been openly questioned by some in his own party in recent days, it's even more crucial for the government that they get this right.And SEND reform is an issue fraught with potential pitfalls.PA MediaStrength of feeling among parents runs high and MPs warn of an erosion of trust in the SEND system\"The problem is there's such a huge trust deficit between parents and government on this issue,\" one Labour backbencher said.\"They know the current system doesn't work, but they worry a new system won't make it better and might make it worse and there's not enough trust in the bank to be able to trade on that.\"Few would dispute the need to reform the SEND system. In recent years demand has spiralled upwards, with a record one in five children in England now requiring support.Many parents find themselves facing a system under strain, with provision patchy and families often locked in lengthy legal battles to get support for their children.Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that spending on special educational needs and disabilities will have more than doubled in real terms by 2028–29 as compared with 2015–16, and councils have been racking up debts as the cost of support outstrips budgets, leading to warnings of a \"total system collapse\".Sources close to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson say she is prepared to \"grasp the nettle\" and take the difficult but necessary decisions, driven by the belief that reform is essential to provide children with the support they need.But the government has been treading carefully. The schools white paper setting out SEND reforms was delayed last year, with ministers taking time to engage in a series of \"listening exercises\" with parents and professionals in the sector.The thinking within government is clear. Ministers favour inclusive mainstream education for more children with special educational needs, where from the early years they get the support they require within local mainstream schools, with specialist school places for those with complex needs.A series of recent announcements have been described as a \"downpayment\" on the government's approach and commitment to funding; in December, there was £3bn to create places for children with SEND in mainstream schools, followed this year by £200m to train teachers in supporting children with SEND and £1bn to create suitable spaces in mainstream school buildings.The government has also agreed to clear £5bn worth of debts that councils have built up, and take on responsibility for SEND funding from 2028.One backbench Labour MP said they were \"reassured\" by the announcements so far. \"It builds my confidence in the fact they're serious about what needs to be done at the get go on this,\" they said.But they said they were still waiting and watching for the detail of the government's wider plan.A potential flashpoint is what the government decides to do regarding Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) – the legal documents that underpin a child's right to support.Official government figures show the number of these plans increased by 166% between January 2015 and January 2025, from 240,000 to 639,000.There is a school of thought – articulated by parliament's education select committee in a report last year – that providing the support children need from the earliest stages in mainstream school settings will mean fewer parents need to go down the often difficult and adversarial route of pursuing an EHCP to access help.But MPs are aware that parents fear any erosion of legal rights, with an active campaign underway called Save Our Children's Rights petitioning the government.\"I think probably the key is if a parent can stand up and demonstrate they and their child have got fewer rights today than they had yesterday, that'll be the killer blow,\" said one Labour backbencher.\"This is where the trust problem comes. I can tell you we're going to put loads of support into mainstream and then it will get better, the trouble is we've lost so much trust and confidence with the public – not just this Labour government but the whole SEND system.\"The government has insisted current support and legal entitlements will not be removed, but has not ruled out future changes to the system.There are Labour MPs who feel encouraged, with one describing \"thoughtful thinking\" that is taking place in government.But even among those who are optimistic there is caution, given the complexity and scale of the issue, with repeated warnings that the government has to \"keep engaging\" with parents and people working in the sector.Some argue the government needs to go further. The County Councils Network has warned the government not to \"duck\" reforms, saying in order to improve outcomes for children, costs have to be \"tackled and curtailed\" and there should be legislative change to focus EHCPs on those most in need.Every party in Westminster has acknowledged the need to reform England's SEND system.The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.The Liberal Democrats have outlined fundamental principles including a \"fair funding system\" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils, while Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy after the party's deputy leader, Richard Tice, said some parents were \"abusing the system\" – limiting the support for those \"genuinely in need\".The challenge for the government is delivering reforms bold enough to improve a system under enormous strain without alienating parents or leading to a backlash from its own MPs – all within constrained budgets. It's no wonder they're treading carefully.",

Meanwhile, the Environmental Agency has dozens of flood warnings and alerts in place across England.With rain about, the Met Office has warned commuters to stay vigilant due to the risk of black ice forming on untreated surfaces which could lead to travel disruption.It said Sunday was expected to be a \"chilly night for many,\" with a frost in the north.It added: \"Following a spell of rain and some hill snow during Sunday afternoon, temperatures will fall below freezing as skies clear from the west through the evening and overnight, leading to ice forming on untreated surfaces.\"Areas covered by the yellow weather warning for ice include: Central, Tayside & Fife, Grampian, the Highlands, South West Scotland, Strathclyde and Northumberland in north-east England.Meanwhile, 74 flood warnings and 195 flood alerts have been issued by the Environment Agency across England - concentrated in the south and the Midlands - following a long spell of wet weather.Jonathan Day, flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but about 330 have been flooded.Natural Resources Wales has issued three flood alerts - for South Pembrokeshire, Vyrnwy catchment and the Lower Severn catchment in Powys.Monday will see variable cloud cover, bright spells and scattered showers for most, BBC Weather said, with a few longer spells of rain at times for southern areas. Spells of rain and hill snow are expected for northern Scotland.Cloud and rain is then predicted to push into south-west England and south Wales late on Tuesday, Met Office operational meteorologist Dan Stroud said.\"During the course of Wednesday this will bring a mix of rain, sleet and hill snow,\" he said.\"We do need to keep an eye on this system, there's the potential for snow warnings to be issued.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesDisney owns multiple franchises, including Marvel and its characters like Spider-ManChinese technology giant ByteDance has pledged to curb a controversial artificial intelligence (AI) video-making tool, following threats of legal action from Disney and complaints from other entertainment giants.In the last few days, videos made using the latest version of the app Seedance have proliferated online. Many have been lauded for their realism.On Friday, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance accusing it of supplying Seedance with a \"pirated library\" of the studio's copyrighted characters, including those from Marvel and Star Wars.Disney's lawyers accused ByteDance of committing a \"virtual smash-and-grab\" of their intellectual property, including superheroes from Marvel, Star Wars and various cartoons.On Monday ByteDance told the BBC that the company \"respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.\"\"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users.\"ByteDance did not respond to questions asking for details on the safeguards it plans to implement.Reddit/AI-generated imageOne clip online said to have been created with Seedance shows a fight between Anakin Skywalker and Rey from Star WarsLike other generative-AI tools, Seedance can create videos based on short text prompts.Many of Seedance's clips are based on real actors and shows and some have gone viral since the launch of its latest 2.0 version on 12 February. The BBC has found clips online said to have been generated by Seedance showing Star Wars characters Anakin Skywalker and Rey battling with their lightsabres, and Spider-Man fighting Captain America on the streets of New York.The company has not disclosed what data it uses to train Seedance.ByteDance had previously said the product had already paused the ability for users to upload images of real people. The company also said it respects intellectual property rights and copyright protections, and takes any potential infringement seriously.Disney's legal threat follows criticism from other organisations in Hollywood over the Seedance platform.The Motion Picture Association, which represents major US studios like Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount and Netflix, has demanded that the tool \"immediately cease its infringing activity\".Actors' union Sag-Aftra has also accused Seedance of \"blatant infringement\".Meanwhile the Japanese government has launched an investigation into the Chinese firm over potential copyright violations, after AI-generated videos of popular Japanese anime characters showed up on online.Other AI image‑generation tools have likewise been hit with legal action.Last year, Disney and NBCUniversal sued AI image generator Midjourney, accusing the platform of generating \"endless unauthorised copies\" of the studios' copyrighted works. The case is ongoing.Disney has also asked Google to restrict the generation of its characters on Google's AI platforms.",

    "body": "4 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles at the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Justice and the Home OfficeThe frontrunner to become the country's most senior civil servant was spoken to about her management and leadership style after an inquiry into a complaint against her.Dame Antonia Romeo, understood to be the government's favoured candidate for cabinet secretary, was investigated over three allegations when she worked in New York in 2017.The outcome of that investigation was \"there is no case to answer\", Dame Antonia was told in a letter seen by BBC News. But a source said she faced \"tough conversations\" about her leadership style.A Cabinet Office spokesperson emphasised that it was a single complaint that was dismissed, and said Dame Antonia has a long \"record of excellent public service\".A source said that \"there were some issues of personal style that grated with people.\"\"That was not an easy conversation. She took her medicine,\" they said, but they added there had been a thorough investigation and nothing of substance was upheld.The three allegations came from a single complaint and were related to her use of expenses and accusations of bullying when she was the government's consul-general in New York, the BBC understands.In a letter seen by BBC News outlining the outcome of the investigation Rupert McNeil, then the government chief people officer, told Dame Antonia \"there is no case to answer\".McNeil added in the letter from March 2017: \"I appreciate processes of this type are always distressing, but as discussed, they are rich sources of feedback about management and leadership style.\"I know from our conversation that you are very alert to this, and this process has given you rich insight.\"The letter, marked \"official - sensitive\", was shared with Jeremy Heywood, the then-cabinet secretary, John Manzoni, the then-permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, Kim Darroch, then-British ambassador to the US, the HR directors at the foreign office and cabinet office, and Simon McDonald, now Lord McDonald, who was then-head of the foreign office.Lord McDonald made a highly unusual intervention this week, saying he had tried to get in touch with No10 about the possibility of Dame Antonia being appointed and warning \"more due diligence\" was needed.\"The due diligence needs to be thorough. If the candidate mentioned in the media is the one, in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go,\" he told Channel 4 News.Others in government defended Dame Antonia vociferously, accusing Lord McDonald of a \"disgusting\" and \"hugely irresponsible\" attack on her.One official who has worked with her recently described her as \"the most inspiring leader in the civil service\".\"There are people right from the very top to the most junior staff who are outraged and completely baffled. Not only that it's an attack on a civil servant who can't defend themselves, but also that it is not remotely true.\"People follow her and want to work with her.\"Another official who spoke to the BBC stressed that in the nine years since the investigation, the civil servant had led three government departments with a combined staff of around 150,000 people and not received a single complaint.Sir Matthew Rycroft, who was UK Permanent Representative to the UN at the time Romeo was in New York in 2017, said: \"The decision maker was the CEO of the Civil Service. He concluded that there was no case to answer, and he reported this to the Cabinet Secretary who agreed.\"I was the senior FCDO official in New York at the time, and having seen the relevant documentation myself, I can confirm that I too was satisfied there was no case to answer in relation to the single formal complaint that was made.\"Rupert McNeil, the head of HR for the British Government at the time, said: \"As the head of the Civil Service Human Resources function at the time, I can confirm the investigation into the one formal complaint against Antonia nine years ago was done thoroughly and independently – and it concluded there was no case to answer.\"The smears being thrown against her are reprehensible and hypocritical. They undermine every investigation that the civil service has run.\"Former officials making these entirely inappropriate remarks were actively part of the governance of civil service processes and so it is astonishing that they feel they can make comments now which they never made to me at the time.\"She is an excellent public servant who has served governments of all stripes with diligence and respect.\"A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ⁠\"As we have repeatedly made clear, one formal complaint was raised nine years ago and the allegations were dismissed on the basis that there was no case to answer. This letter confirms that is the case.\"Antonia Romeo is an outstanding leader with a 25-year record of excellent public service.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoMax MatzaTwitter/@DeptofWarFootage posted by the Pentagon appears to show troops boarding the tankerThe US military has boarded a second oil tanker in the Indian Ocean, after tracking it from the Caribbean Sea where it was suspected of helping Venezuela avoid US sanctions. The boarding of the Panamanian-flagged Veronica III is the second such US interception in the Indian Ocean in the past week. It comes amid a US crackdown on sanctioned oil exports from Venezuela. \"Distance does not protect you,\" the Pentagon said in a statement, alongside video and photos which appear to show the US raid.At least seven oil tankers have been seized by the US since last year, as the Trump administration moves to control the supply of Venezuelan oil.The Pentagon statement on Sunday defined the operation as \"a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding\". The statement did not say whether the US had seized the vessel, or allowed it to continue on its journey.\"The vessel tried to defy President Trump's quarantine - hoping to slip away,\" the Pentagon statement said. \"We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.\"No other nation has the reach, endurance, or will to do this. International waters are not sanctuary. By land, air, or sea, we will find you and deliver justice.\"The Veronica III is currently under sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department. The Veronica III departed Venezuela on 3 January, according to monitoring group TankerTrackers.com - the same day that the US captured Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in a raid on his presidential compound in CaracasThe ship was carrying 1.9 million barrels of crude oil at the time of departure, the group says, adding that it is believed to have been involved in the transport of Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil since 2023.Twitter/@DeptofWarIn December, US President Donald Trump said that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the Venezuelan government at the time described as \"theft\".The US blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual.Loadings had fallen roughly by half in January to about 400,000 barrels per day, Matt Smith, head of US analysis at analytics firm Kpler, told the BBC last month.",

    "body": "9 hours agoGetty ImagesEpibatidine, which can be secreted by Anthony's poison arrow frog onto its skin, was blamed for Alexei Navalny's death by five European nationsRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, the UK and some of its European allies have said.Traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body and highly likely resulted in his death in a Siberian penal colony two years ago, the UK Foreign Office said.The allies said only the Russian state had the \"means, motive and opportunity\" to deploy this lethal toxin.The Kremlin dismissed the finding as \"an information campaign\", according to Tass news agency.What is the toxin?Epibatidine is a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog, according to toxicology expert Jill Johnson.It was \"200 times more potent\" than morphine, she told BBC Russian.Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America as well as being manufactured in a laboratory.Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia, the European allies said in their statement.Species known as Anthony's poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog are among those that secrete the toxin onto their skin.Although epibatidine has been investigated as a painkiller and for relief from painful inflammatory lung conditions, it is not used clinically because of its toxicity.How does dart frog poison work?This powerful chemical compound acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, according to Johnson.Because it overstimulates these nerve receptors, if dosed correctly, it can cause muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and ultimately death, she explained.Alastair Hay, professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, told PA that its effects can result in breathing being blocked, and that \"any person poisoned dies from suffocation\".The toxin being found in someone's blood \"suggests deliberate administration\", he added.Epibatidine toxicity can even be \"increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched\", Hay said.How rare is the toxin?Epibatidine is extremely rare and found in only one geographic region and only in trace amounts, Johnson said.It is understood the dart frog referred to by the UK Foreign Office and others was Anthony's poison arrow frog, a species endemic to Ecuador and Peru.The frogs produce the chemical through eating the right foods to produce alkaloids - a type of organic compound - that make epibatidine and accumulate it in their skin. If the frog's diet changes, its epibatidine reserves will be depleted.\"Finding a wild frog in the right place, eating exactly the food needed to produce the right alkaloids, is almost impossible... almost,\" Johnson said.\"This is an incredibly rare method of human poisoning. The only other cases of epibatidine poisoning I know of were laboratory-based and non-fatal.\"What has Russia said?European laboratories confirmed Navalny died from the obscure poison, the allies said on Saturday.Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, though Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was \"murdered\" by poisoning.The Russian embassy in London denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as \"feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists\" and \"necro-propaganda\".Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted by Russian state-run news agency Tass as saying: \"All the talks and statements are an information campaign aimed at distracting attention from the West's pressing problems.\"At the time of his death, Navalny had been in jail for three years and had latterly been transferred to an Arctic penal colony.According to Russian accounts, the 47-year-old took a short walk, said he felt unwell, then collapsed and never regained consciousness.",

    "body": "8 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient.The letter sent to members of the US Congress on Saturday from US Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputy said all documents held by the DoJ had been released and contained a list of names appearing in the files.Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Epstein were released by the DoJ earlier this month.In the letter, Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche wrote: \"In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all 'records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department' that 'relate to' any of nine different categories.\"No records were withheld from the DoJ's release \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity\", the letter added. The individuals listed in the letter include people who \"are or were a government official or politically exposed person\", and whose name appeared at least once in the files, the letter says. The names appear in the files in a \"wide variety of contexts\", including some people who had \"extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell\" and others who were merely referenced in documents or news articles contained in the files, Blanche and Bondi wrote. Getty ImagesLawmakers Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are calling for justice department to release more Epstein filesDonald Trump, Bill Gates, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and Bill Clinton - who are included in the list - all had documented past relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and each has denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes. But the list also includes the names of deceased musicians Janis Joplin and Elvis Presley. The letter was addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dick Durbin, as well as the House Judiciary Committee's chairman Jim Jordan and ranking member Jamie Raskin.In an interview on ABC This Week on Sunday, Massie argued that, even though the DoJ \"wants to say they are done with this document production\", there are more crucial files that should be released. The DoJ was \"signing deliberative process privilege in order not to release some of the documents\", he said.\"The problem with that is the bill that Ro Khanna and I wrote says that they must release internal memos and notes and emails about their decisions on whether to prosecute or not prosecute, whether to investigate or not investigate.\"In response to the letter, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, accused the DoJ of \"purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email\".\"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,\" Khanna wrote on X on Saturday. \"Release the full files,\" he added. \"Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names.\"The BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment. US lawmakers previously said files on Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release, leading to at least one document being unredacted after their criticism. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have also said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified. At the time, the DoJ said mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\" and they had taken down all the flagged files. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersGerman Galushchenko (left) was among several figures in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's government implicated in alleged corruptionA former energy minister in Ukraine has been detained while attempting to leave the country, authorities have said.German Galushchenko, who was forced out of his government role last year after being among officials named in a corruption scandal, was reportedly apprehended while on a train leaving Ukraine. It is unclear where he intended to travel to.He was one of several government figures implicated in an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scheme in November.The scandal threatened to engulf Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's administration, which swept to power before Russia's full-scale invasion on the promise to root out corruption.Zelensky's chief-of-staff Andriy Yermak - his closest adviser throughout the war - resigned after his home was searched. Neither the president nor Yermak have been accused of any wrongdoing.The scandal has, however, increased pressure from the US to hold elections, which have been suspended since the start of the war in 2022 due to provisions in Ukraine's constitution.The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) said in a statement on Sunday that its detectives had detained the former energy minister \"while crossing the state border\", as part of the Midas case.It did not name Galushchenko explicitly, but he has been named by several prominent Ukrainian media organisations.Galushchenko was briefly justice minister, a post he held when he was told by Zelensky to resign in November, having served as energy minister for three years prior to that. His successor, Svitlana Hrynchuk, also resigned after being implicated in the scandal.Nabu gave no further details on Galuschenko's detention, but said it would provide updates in due course.Radio Free Europe reports that he was being transported to Kyiv for further questioning, after border guards were told to alert the authorities if he attempted to flee.A massive anti-corruption probe, dubbed Operation Midas, was the culmination of 15 months of investigating, Nabu and Ukraine's other anti-corruption body, the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap), said.They accused several people of orchestrating a scheme to embezzle money in Ukraine's energy sector, including at the national nuclear opertor Energoatom.Galuschenko was among those alleged to have systematically collected kickbacks from Enerhoatom contractors worth between 10% and 15% of contract values.The anti-corruption bodies also said the huge sums had been laundered in the scheme and published photographs of bags full of cash. The funds were then transferred outside Ukraine, including to Russia, Nabu said.Galushchenko previously said he would defend himself against the accusations.Former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov was arrested in November on suspicion of \"illicit enrichment\", having already been charged with abuse of office. Timur Mindich, a businessman and a co-owner of Zelensky's former TV studio Kvartal95, reportedly fled the country after he was flagged as a suspect. That the figures were accused of enriching themselves from Ukraine's energy sector caused particular outrage domestically, as the scandal broke as Russia stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure ahead of a bitterly cold winter.The former Soviet Union member has long been plagued by issues of corruption, which have continued despite Nabu and Sap operating for a decade.Cracking down on corruption is seen as a key requirement for Ukraine joining the EU.",

    "body": "'It's never too late': Savannah Guthrie's new plea for mother's release as FBI analyses glove29 minutes agoGrace Eliza GoodwinWatch: 'It is never too late to do the right thing' Savannah Guthrie saysSavannah Guthrie has issued a plea for her 84-year-old mother's release two weeks after she disappeared, urging anyone involved that \"it is never too late to do the right thing\".In the US TV anchor's latest video appeal, she addresses \"whoever has her, or knows where she is\", adding that Nancy Guthrie's loved ones \"still have hope\". It comes as investigators analyse DNA found on a glove that appears to match one a suspect was wearing in doorbell camera footage taken the night Nancy Guthrie went missing.Authorities believe the suspect in the video kidnapped Guthrie in the early hours of the morning of 1 February.The FBI said on Sunday that investigators recovered the glove from a field near the side of the road about two miles from Guthrie's home in Tucson, Arizona. The agency collected about 16 gloves from various locations near her home, though most turned out to have been discarded by people searching for her.\"The one with the DNA profile recovered is different and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,\" the FBI said. The agency said it has received preliminary DNA test results on the glove and is still waiting for \"quality control and official confirmation\" before entering an \"unknown male profile\" into its database.Earlier this week, investigators released footage from a doorbell camera at Guthrie's front door that shows a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack. In the video, the suspect walks toward the camera and tries to cover it with his gloved hand before grabbing some brush from the front yard to block the camera's view. After conducting a forensic analysis of the video, the FBI announced earlier this week that it believed the man was between 5ft 9in and 5ft 10in (175-177cm) tall with an average build.The FBI also highlighted the backpack the suspect was wearing in the video, identifying it as a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.Watch: New video shows masked person outside Nancy Guthrie's homeThe county sheriff's department has said the suspect description \"remains a key focus\", but added that \"investigators are not ruling out any individuals or possibilities\".Guthrie was last seen on 31 January, when a family member dropped her off at her home following a get-together at her daughter Annie's house. Members of her church noticed her absence the following day and notified her family.In the two weeks since Guthrie's disappearance, the FBI and Pima County Sheriff's Office have conducted a massive search operation involving helicopters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of officers while taking in thousands of call-in tips. Officials have warned that she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said Guthrie was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Local officials have also said investigators found DNA at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her.The FBI has increased the reward for information about Guthrie's disappearance from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000.",

    "body": "10 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven people were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five. The Israel Defense Forces said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of the ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.Gaza's Civil Defence said 11 people had been killed in the strikes, while staff at the Al-Shifa hospital said a 12th person was killed in an exchange of gunfire, separate from the air strikes.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which is due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Sunday that members of the board had pledged $5bn (£3.6bn) to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also repeated calls for Hamas to move forward with disarmament. Hamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

    "body": "26 minutes agoZoe Kleinman,Technology editor,Adam GoldsmithandClaire KeenanGetty ImagesPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged to \"crack down on the addictive elements of social media\" as part of the government's new online safety plans.The government also plans to introduce powers to speedily change the law in response to developing online behaviours, and to update legislation to preserve children's social media and online data - as campaigned for by the group Jools' Law.Opponents accused the government of \"inaction\", and have called for Parliament to be given a vote on the social media ban for children.The government had already said it would launch the public consultation in March, seeking opinions about restricting children's access to AI chatbots and limiting infinite scrolling features for children – also known as doomscrolling.It follows arguments between ministers and X's Elon Musk earlier this year, after the platform's Grok AI chatbot was used to make fake nude images of women.Ahead of launching the consultation, Sir Keir said: \"The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass.\" \"Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up. With my government, Britain will be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to online safety,\" he said.Other measures being considered include preventing children from using virtual private networks (VPNs) to illicitly access pornography and amending the law so chatbots have to protect users from illegal content.In an article on the website Substack, Sir Keir said that, as a parent of two teenagers, he knows children's access to social media is \"something that is front and centre of a lot of parents' minds right now\". He said: \"In the past 20+ years, social media has evolved to become something completely different from the simple, stripped-back pages it was in its conception.\"And in that evolution, it has become something that is quietly harming our children.\"The prime minister added that the government will \"bring new powers that will give us the ability to crack down on the addictive elements of social media, stop the auto-play, the never-ending scrolling, that keeps are children hooked on their screens for hours, and stop kids getting around age limits\".\"And if that means a fight with the big social media companies, then bring it on,\" he said.PA MediaElla Roome believes her son Jools (left) died when an internet challenge went wrongThere are also plans to change rules on how children's social media data is stored under the Crime and Policing Bill, after the Jools' Law campaign.In 2022, Ellen Roome's son Jools died aged 14. She believes he was trying an internet challenge which went wrong, but has never been able to access his data to prove it. Under current rules, a child's data must be requested from tech companies within 12 months of their death by either a coroner or the police.But bereaved parents say often by the time that happens, this record of what their child has been doing online has already been deleted.New rules will mean it has to be preserved within five days if it might be relevant to the cause of death, which hopefully means more families will get some answers.\"This going forward will help other bereaved families,\" Roome said. \"What we now need to do is stop the harm happening in the first place. This is really relevant when a child dies, but we need to stop them dying in the first place.\"Lord Nash, a Conservative former minister who has been campaigning in the Lords for tighter social media controls for children, welcomed the adoption of Jools' Law by the government.But, he said to avoid \"future tragedies\", the \"government must raise the age limit to 16 for the most harmful platforms now\". Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the consultation announcement as \"inaction\", and said Britain was \"lagging behind. \"I am clear that we should stop under-16s accessing these platforms,\" she said.Liberal Democrat spokeswoman Munira Wilson, too, accused the government of continuing to \"kick the can down the road\" and called for a \"much clearer, firm timeline\" on when action will be taken.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the government was \"determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at time of rapid technological change\" and would \"not wait\" to take the action families needed.

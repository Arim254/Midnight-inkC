    "body": "14 minutes agoMaia DaviesGetty Images\"I do not want to reconcile with my family,\" Brooklyn Peltz-Beckham has said in a statement addressing his strained relationship with his parents.Peltz-Beckham, the eldest child of Sir David Beckham and Lady Victoria  Beckham, accused his parents of trying to \"endlessly ruin\" his relationship before and after his wedding to Nicola Peltz-Beckham.\"My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one,\" he said on Instagram on Monday.Speculation has been circulating for months about the state of Brooklyn's relationship with his parents. The BBC has reached out to Sir David's and Lady Beckham's representatives for comment. The 26-year-old said he had been subject to \"endless attacks from my parents, both privately and publicly, that were sent to the press on their orders\".He accused his fashion designer mother of derailing his wedding in 2022, including cancelling making Nicola's dress \"in the eleventh hour despite how excited she was to wear her design, forcing her to urgently find a new dress\".Reports emerged at the time that Nicola, 31, had refused to wear one of Lady Beckham's designs.She later told the Times that Lady Victoria had realised her atelier could not finish it in time, denying claims of a rift.",

    "body": "The lawyers of the owners of a Swiss bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Eve killing 40 people and injuring 116 have broken their silence to criticise \"lies\" about their clients. Jessica and Jacques Moretti were  \"devastated\", the lawyers told local media, but denied being aware of any dangers at their venue.\"There is a sort of public vindictiveness directed against them,\" one of the three lawyers, Yaël Hayat, said.Initial findings from the investigation suggest the fire began as sparklers attached to champagne bottles ignited soundproof foaming that lined the ceiling of the basement of Le Constellation bar in the popular ski resort of Crans-Montana. Authorities have acknowledged that the bar had not undergone safety checks for five years.Most of the victims of the fire were young - eight were under the age of 16 - and many are being treated in hospital for severe burns.Many stories about the couple, the venue they managed, as well as their past have circulated in the local media since the fire, increasing pressure on the authorities as they investigate the accident and prosecute the owners.In an interview with Tribune de Geneve, the lawyers said the couple wanted to \"restore the truth\".Hayat said reports her client Jessica had left the burning building with cash from the register were a lie, telling BFMTV: \"In no way did she leave the scene in a hurry; she stayed there to help and support the injured.\"Patrick Michod, representing Jacques Moretti, said: \"When you run an establishment and a tragedy like this occurs, you feel responsible. Now, the major question in this case is the question of criminal responsibility, which is obviously not the same thing as the feelings one may have as the operator.\"Asked about the foam in the ceiling, Michod said his client obtained the material from a \"major construction retailer\" which did not disclose that it was flammable. \"He did not want to install a highly flammable foam. He wanted to install acoustic foam,\" he said. Lawyers representing the family of Cyane Panine, a staff member at Le Constellation who died in the blaze, said she had received no safety training and was unaware of the danger posed by the ceiling that caught fire. Hayat described Panine as a close friend of the couple, and pulled out a postcard she said had been written by her to the Morettis, Tribune de Geneve reported. \"I hope I will continue to grow alongside you and that we will spend many more New Year's Eves together [...] you are like my second family,\" the postcard said.The Moretti couple have been accused by authorities of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Last week, a Swiss court imposed a travel ban on Jessica Moretti as an alternative to pre-trial detention. She has had to surrender her passport and must report to police every day.She previously told reporters that she was sorry about the \"unthinkable tragedy\".Jacques Moretti is being held in custody for an initial period of 90 days. Prosecutors have also argued the couple present a flight risk and have asked judges to impose a 400,000-franc bail ($500,000; £374,000)as a condition for their release - 200,000 for each.Michod said that he had filed a request to release Jacques Moretti.

    "body": "3 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has warned her MPs against more plotting and \"psychodrama\" after two defections from the party in four days.Former shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick became the most senior Tory to move to Reform UK, after Badenoch discovered he was planning to defect last week, and sacked him.Andrew Rosindell, who was the shadow minister for foreign affairs for the Conservatives, made the leap to Nigel Farage's party this weekend.Now Badenoch has called some of her MPs on the right of the party to a meeting on Monday night, to underline the message.Farage will be attending a rally with Jenrick in the former Tory's Newark constituency. The Reform leader has  warned those thinking of defecting to his party that they should do so before the May elections or risk being rejected.In a letter obtained by BBC, Badenoch insisted the defections were \"a minor setback, not a defining moment\" for her party, and called for unity.\"A party that is ruthlessly focused on being effective, holding the government to account and creating a plan for the country cannot also spend its time on psychodrama and intrigue,\" she wrote.The Conservative leader also suggested MPs \"satisfy themselves\" about their own staff's behaviour, because \"a small number of individuals were actively briefing against the party while presenting themselves as Conservative sources\". She warned: \"Those who want to undermine or destroy the party will be dealt with firmly and fairly.\"Former Conservatives, including David Gauke, who was justice secretary under Theresa May, have suggested the party should move towards the centre ground and leave the \"populist right\" to Reform, but Badenoch dismissed this as  a \"serious misreading of the situation\".Instead, she attacked the more than 20 former Tories who have moved to Farage's party as being part of a wider cultural problem, insisting the defections \"are not about policy differences or ideology\" but \"character\" and \"those who put individual ambition\" above public service.Badenoch said she believed Britain is not \"broken\", as Jenrick claimed in his defection speech, but pointed the finger at a broken political culture \"because too many who come into it are motivated by self-interest and not national interest\".Sir Keir Starmer also \"cannot get legislation through because of the self-interest of his own MPs\", despite having a huge majority, she said.But she also told MPs the Conservatives are \"stronger and more united now\", adding: \"We are a team that wants to talk to voters, not just to ourselves or online echo chambers.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "2 hours agoThomas MackintoshReutersGwyneth Paltrow and Valentino Garavani pose at the West Coast premiere of the documentary \"Valentino: The Last Emperor\"Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavani, known as Valentino, has died at the age of 93.One of the giants of 20th century fashion, Valentino's creations were worn by celebrities and well-known figures including Elizabeth Taylor, Nancy Reagan, Sharon Stone, Julia Roberts and Gwyneth Paltrow.He co-founded the Valentino fashion house in 1960 and ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld at the top of the profession.In a statement posted on Instagram the Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti Foundation said: \"He passed away peacefully in his Roman home, surrounded by the love of his family.\"The foundation said Valentino will be lying in state at Piazza Mignanelli between 21 and 22 January.Valentino's funeral service will be held the following day at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels and Martyrs, the foundation said.Born in Lombardy in May 1932, Valentino was known for his collections that displayed luxury, wealth and opulence as well as broad shoulder padding.Watch: 'I used to do 30, 40 drawings in one day' - Valentino in BBC interview from 2012He moved to Paris to study at the ​​Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne when he was just 17, and went on to work with Jacques Fath, Balenciaga, Jean Dessès and Guy Laroche.His creation of the \"Valentino red\"  inspired by a trip to Spain, helped elevate the brand to global fame with the debut of the iconic fiesta dress.It became such a meaningful colour for the house that for Valentino's last collection in 2007 all the models wore red dresses for the finale.In December 2023, Valentino was honoured with the outstanding achievement award at the British Fashion Awards which were held at London's Royal Albert Hall.Alexandra Shulman, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that every aspect of Valentino \"epitomised glamour and luxury\".\"It is very sad news because he was one of the last of the great designers of the modern day and I think his main contribution will be that he was what people wanted a fashion designer to be,\" Shulman said.\"He really didn't care that much that he wasn't the most fashionable, the most cutting edge designer, he just wanted to produce clothes that were beautiful and they were.\"He also kept his celebrity customers for a long time, he started off with people like Jacqueline Kennedy who wore Valentino when she was in mourning.\"AFP via Getty ImagesShulman listed a number of Hollywood stars who have been big supporters of Valentino's designs over the last 15 years - including Paltrow, Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Lopez.\"He was helped in later years by the red carpet became such a thing, because that's what his clothes were about,\" Shulman added.\"They weren't something you slipped on to go to the office - they were really fabulous gowns.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesandTom Symonds & Imogen James,Royal Courts of JusticeWatch: Prince Harry arrives at the High Court in London on Monday morningThe Duke of Sussex was made to feel \"paranoid beyond belief\" by alleged unlawful information gathering by the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, a court has heard.Prince Harry is among seven high-profile claimants including Sir Elton John and Liz Hurley alleging the papers' publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), committed \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period.The prince felt his \"every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it\", according to a written submission by his lawyer.ANL said the duke's social circle was \"known to be a good source of leaks\" to the press and has repeatedly denied the claimants' allegations.Antony White KC, representing the publisher, said it was \"a striking feature of the case that none of the articles were the subject of complaint by the claimants at the time of publication\".\"The pattern of misconduct the claimants seek to establish is simply not made out.\"Joining the duke in bringing the lawsuit against ANL are:Actors Liz Hurley and Sadie FrostSir Elton John and his husband David FurnishSir Simon Hughes, the former Liberal Democrat MPBaroness Doreen Lawrence, a campaigner whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in south London in 1993NEIL HALL/EPA/ShutterstockSadie Frost attended the first day of the trial at the High Court on MondayPrince Harry was present in the courtroom on Monday for the first day of the trial, which is expected to last nine weeks.David Sherborne, representing the claimants, quoted the prince in his written submission as saying the papers' alleged activity created \"distrust and suspicion\".He said the \"intrusion\" was \"terrifying\" for his loved ones while \"isolating me\".Sherborne said the alleged unlawful information gathering in the duke's case was related to 14 articles between 2001 and 2013.The Daily Mail's current royal editor Rebecca English was accused of \"obtaining the exact plane seats, flight times and travel plans\" of Prince Harry's then-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in December 2007.Sherborne alleged the information was obtained through private investigator Mike Behr, who was accused of suggesting he could \"plant someone next to her\" on the flight to South Africa.For the publisher, White said English \"strongly denies that she ever used Mr Behr for unlawful information-gathering\", and the allegation was \"unsupported by the evidence before the court\".He said the prince's social circle \"at all material times… was and was known to be a good source of leaks or disclosure of information to the media about what he got up to in his private life.\"He said all the articles \"were sourced entirely legitimately from information variously provided by contacts of the journalists responsible\", including press officers and publicists, freelance journalists, photographers and prior reports.White also said the duke discussed his private life in the media and that information about his life was provided by Palace spokespeople.Sherborne said there had been \"systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" at the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday and that there was \"no way\" that details reported in some articles could have been lawfully obtained.In their joint opening statement, the claimants accused a string of senior Mail and Mail on Sunday journalists of commissioning and using unlawfully gathered information from private investigators.They said they were \"engaged in or complicit in the culture of unlawful information gathering that wrecked the lives of so many\".Sir Elton and Furnish accused ANL of \"stealing\" their son Zachary's birth certificate before they \"had a chance to see it ourselves,\" accusing the publisher of \"invasion of medical details\".White said in written submissions that their claims were \"unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless\".Mail on Sunday journalist Katie Nicholl was accused of having obtained intimate information about Frost's private life - including the termination of her pregnancy, about which the actor had not even told her mother.Notebooks showed \"Susie\" of ELI, a private investigation firm, provided information on the point, Sherborne said, adding that days later there were payments recorded as \"KATIE NICHOLLS URGENT ENQ\" and \"K NICHOLLS SEARCHES\".Baroness Lawrence said she felt she had been targeted as she sought the truth about her son's murder.She said she felt she \"could not even grieve the injustice of what was happening privately, even for a day\" and that she had been made \"a victim all over again\".Her allegations concern five articles published between 1997 and 2007, written by veteran Daily Mail crime correspondent Stephen Wright.The claims include that he made payments of thousands in cash for \"special contacts re Stephen Lawrence\" and \"special inquiries\", and that he got \"well-known blagger\" Christine Hart to call Baroness Lawrence pretending to be a journalist from the Guardian, as it was believed she would be more likely to speak to her.Baroness Lawrence said she was \"angry that the Mail seem more interested in interrogating me about how I found out what they did to me... then threatening to question me at trial about all this, rather than saying sorry, investigating what it did, and getting at the truth of what happened\".White said the allegations against the reporter were \"denied in their entirety\" and were \"unsupported by the available evidence\".REUTERS/Toby MelvilleThe prince listened to the first day of proceedingsSherborne meanwhile said ANL had kept up a \"hear-no-evil, see-no-evil, speak-no-evil defence\", claiming that during the 2012 Leveson public inquiry - into the culture, practice and ethics of the press - the publisher argued there had been no unlawful activity at all.He said ANL \"knew they had skeletons in their closet\" because the company investigated the use of phone hacking between 2003-05, finding evidence in stories that the technique had been used.ANL has repeatedly denied the allegations, calling them \"lurid\" and \"preposterous\".White said: \"In relation to almost every article alleged to be the product of phone hacking or phone tapping Associated is able to call a witness or witnesses to explain how the article was in fact sourced.\"The lawyer added that \"the pattern of misconduct the claimants seek to establish is simply not made out.\"This is a civil trial, so there is no jury. The judge Mr Justice Nicklin will decide the case on his own.It is Prince Harry's third major court battle accusing newspaper groups of unlawful behaviour.In December 2023, he won 15 claims in his case accusing Mirror Group Newspapers of unlawfully gathering information for stories published about him.In January 2025, the publisher of the Sun newspaper agreed to pay \"substantial damages\" and issued an apology to the prince, over claims of unlawful intrusion into his life.",

Right?Wrong.In an astonishing article, the Russian government paper is full of praise for Trump and critical of European leaders who oppose a US annexation of Greenland.\"Standing in the way of the US president's historic breakthrough is the stubbornness of Copenhagen and the mock solidarity of intransigent European countries, including so-called friends of America, Britain and France,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"Europe does not need the American greatness that Trump is promoting. Brussels is counting on 'drowning' the US president in the midterm congressional elections, on preventing him from concluding the greatest deal of his life.\"\"Greatest deal\"? The reporter explains what he means. I have to keep reminding myself I am reading the Russian government newspaper, not a pro-Trump publication in America.\"If Trump annexes Greenland by July 4 2026, when America celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, he will go down in history as a figure who asserted the greatness of the United States,\" writes Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\"With Greenland, the US becomes the second largest country in the world after Russia, surpassing Canada in area. For Americans, that's on par with such planetary events as the abolition of slavery by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 or the territorial conquests of the Napoleonic Wars.\"If, thanks to Trump, Greenland becomes part of America…for sure the American people will not forget such an achievement.\"And the Russian reporter has this message for America's president: don't U-turn.\"It is dangerous for the American president to back down over Greenland. This would weaken the position of the Republican Party in the midterm elections and likely result in a Democrat majority on Capitol Hill with the ensuing consequences for Trump. Whereas a rapid annexation of Greenland before the elections can change this political trend.\"In other words, it's in Trump's interest to push ahead with his plans to take over Greenland: according to the Russian government paper.Let that sink in.But why the praise from Moscow? Why the apparent encouragement?It's because Russia has much to gain from the current situation.Trump's fixation with Greenland, his determination to take over the island and impose tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan have put a huge strain on the transatlantic alliance: both on America's relations with Europe, and within Nato.Anything that weakens – or threatens to split – the Western alliance is viewed by Moscow as a huge positive for Russia.\"Europe is at a total loss and, to be honest, it's a pleasure to watch this,\" gloated the Russian tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets in one of its articles about Greenland.What's more, American threats to annex Greenland are being used by pro-Kremlin commentators to try to justify Russia's war on Ukraine.Victory in Ukraine remains the Kremlin's priority. Moscow believes that maintaining a positive relationship with the Trump administration will help achieve this.Hence Russia's criticism of Europe. But not of Donald Trump.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here.

    "body": "5 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandAlicia CurryReutersAt least 39 people have died and dozens more have been injured after two high-speed trains collided in southern Spain, the country's Civil Guard has said.The incident near the city of Córdoba has been described by local officials as Spain's worst rail crash in more than a decade.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited the scene on Monday, where he announced a three-day mourning period.Here's what we know about the incident so far.Follow live updatesWhere did the crash happen?The crash occurred at around 19:45 local time (18:45 GMT) on Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he added.What caused the crash?Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuateWhat caused the train to derail remains unclear. Officials say an investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.Meanwhile, at a news conference during his visit to Adamuz, Prime Minister Sánchez vowed to uncover the cause of the crash and thanked emergency workers  for their help \"in a moment of such pain and tragedy\".Are people still trapped in the trains?Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via ReutersThe Spanish Civil Guard arrived on scene to assess the situation and begin the evaluation processThere were around 400 passengers and staff on the two trains, operated by Iryo and Renfe, according to a statement from Renfe.It is not clear if there are people still trapped inside the carriages but rescue teams are on site. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur that they are waiting for \"heavy machinery\" to \"practically lift\" parts of the second train, which \"has taken the worst part of this accident\".\"Until the heavy machinery can do its job and free the wagons from the track\", emergency services will not be able to start \"searching and identifying\" any remaining victims, he added.Who are the victims?The 39 victims of the crash have not yet been identified, with Puente saying the death toll \"is not yet final\" as investigations into the crash commence.As of Monday afternoon, 122 people had received medical assistance, 48 of whom remained hospitalised, local emergency services said.Among the 48 victims still in hospital, five are under the age of 18.Moreno said teams are working to identify those who have died. What have the survivors said?Spain train crash survivors describe 'absolutely terrifying' scenePassengers on board the Madrid-bound train described the moment of impact feeling like an \"earthquake\" and said it shattered the train's windows, displaced luggage and threw people to the floor. \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" journalist Salvador Jimenez told Canal Sur.\"There were people screaming, calling for doctors,\" he added.Another passenger, Lucas Meriako, told Spanish broadcaster La Sexta Noticias he was in the fifth carriage of the same train when he started to \"feel some banging\" that got louder and louder.\"Another train passed us and everything started vibrating. There was a jolt behind us and the feeling that the whole train was going to fall apart,\" he described.",

    "body": "Three shark attacks have been reported in Sydney in a little over 24 hours, leaving at least two people seriously injured, according to local authorities.A man was taken to hospital in critical condition after being injured at Manly beach on Monday evening, New South Wales Police said in a statement.Hours earlier, an 11-year-old surfer had to be assisted off Sydney's Dee Why Beach after a suspected shark bit his surfboard, with the local council urging swimmers and surfers to be cautious.The first incident saw a 12-year-old boy taken to hospital with critical injuries after he was attacked by a large shark while swimming in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon, police said.The boy and his group of friends were jumping off a six-metre rock ledge at Shark Beach, in the Sydney suburb of Vaucluse, when the attack happened on Sunday.Despite its name, shark attacks are rare at Shark Beach, a popular swimming spot.The boy was pulled out of the water by his friends before rescuers arrived. Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least five fatal shark attacks in the country last year.",

    "body": "1 hour agoNaomi de SouzaBBC Newsbeat PA MediaThe Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality showSpoiler warning: This article contains details of the ongoing series of The Traitors.BBC Traitors star Jessie Stride says helping to raise awareness for those with a stammer \"means more than any prize money\".The Hull hair stylist was a popular faithful on the BBC reality show, but became the sixth player to be murdered by the traitors last week – leaving fellow contestants and viewers gutted. But representing people with speech conditions was always her bigger goal, and has seen her break down more barriers than she could have imagined. The 28-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat she is \"on a high\" after being the first contestant to have a stammer.\"I've had lots of people with stammers reach out, which is just really nice,\" says Jessie.\"I'm just on a really big high. I love it. I'm so happy.\"Ahead of entering the game, Jessie said having a stammer has helped her be \"an authentic person\" because she cannot hide it.Stammering, also known as a stutter, is a difference in the way some people speak which can cause them to repeat sounds or words, according to the charity Stamma. \"I would just love to be able to push (awareness) out a bit more and to get people speaking about stammers and just to help educate those who don't understand it,\" Jessie explains.PA MediaJessie was the first Traitors contestant to have a stammerJessie won many viewers' hearts and contestants in the castle with her loyalty, good humour and bright red hair - but also her ability to observe the behaviour of others. \"I feel like having a stammer makes you a good listener and it kind of helps me to be able to just watch a little bit more,\" she says. \"And I would just watch how Stephen was and how he'd act and I just had an instinct that it could be him.\"By the second week of the series, Jessie successfully identified that fellow contestant Stephen was a traitor after analysing numerous scenarios. The hairdresser doesn't feel her game was impacted by her stammer as the other contestants would be patient and allow her to speak her mind. \"It helped that the whole cast would just wait and were all just really kind about it,\" she says. \"Yes, it would take me longer speech-wise because I would need more time to speak, but the whole cast let me have that, which did help a lot.\"PA MediaShe hopes to continue to break down barriers by working more with children or in TV Jessie says she has received messages from others with a stammer who have said the representation has helped them feel seen.\"I'm hoping that if people who have a stammer watch me that it does give them hope that, you know, we are able to do what we want and that it doesn't have to hold us back,\" she says. When the next Traitors episode lands on Wednesday, many viewers will likely miss Jessie's yellow and orange energy, but she has plans to continue to knock down any challenges coming her way.\"I would love to do more BSL, I would love to work with kids, I'd love to work in TV,\" she says.\"I have an open mind, but I do hope this isn't it and that I could do more here.\"And although she has not won the prize pot, Jessie says she will take away the \"great\" friendships and bonds she made in the Traitors castle.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "7 hours agoLucy HookerBBC News reporterGetty ImagesThere is a reason it is called Blue Monday. Slap-bang in the middle of a month that is all about freezing drizzle and self-denial, the third Monday in January is notoriously the gloomiest day of the year.But some of us are fighting back.Here are some ways to find joy among the January gloom.1. Enjoy everyday things\"I love music. I absolutely love music,\" says Paddy Merritt.Like a lot of people, the 24-year-old finds switching on a favourite tune can completely change his mood.And while a festival or gig is \"true bliss\" even just switching it on in the kitchen can be great, especially with friends.\"There is joy to be found in lots of everyday things,\" he says.That harmonises with David Larbi's philosophy.The poet and online content creator urges his followers to be on the lookout for small wins.\"On the average day, you can have a little smile at four or five things that might seem minute, but bring you a happy feeling,\" he says.\"This morning, it was very cold, and I put my socks on. My feet were a little bit warmer.\"That moment of joy made me feel a lot better.\"Paddy MerrittPaddy Merritt also gets joy from performing his musical comedy2. Be interestedSophie Scott, professor of cognitive neuroscience at University College London, told What's Up Docs on BBC Radio 4, a huge range of things can bring joy.What marks it out is that joy is often quite intense, she says. There is a sense of being \"overwhelmed with the emotion\" in contrast to other forms of happiness, such as comfort or contentment.For many people the experience of getting up on stage might be as far from joy as they can imagine, but Paddy says that is how he gets the really intense, adrenaline-fuelled, joy - from performing musical comedy. Sophie, who has dabbled in stand-up herself says however you do it, just watching comedy or hanging out with friends, do something where there's a chance you'll have one of those \"laughing 'til your face hurts\" moments.But don't panic if joy doesn't happen right on cue. If you want birds to come to your garden you don't march around it shouting \"come on birds\", she points out. You make the garden beautiful and wait.\"Let yourself be enthusiastic about things. Let yourself be interested in things and interested in people,\" she says.3. Dinner with friendsAna CassAna meets her friends at the sauna for the double benefit of the warmth and the chatAna Cass says seeing other people is definitely a source of joy for her. The 27-year-old data scientist struggles with seasonal affective disorder, meaning January can be tough, but she has found ways to counter it.\"What has helped the most is having dinner with friends.\"We take turns hosting. We hang out. We chat. That's the best thing I've done all winter.\"At the weekend, instead of cafes, she and her friends often choose to meet at the sauna and plunge pool, with the added buzz that offers.\"That rush makes you forget that January is miserable and cold.\"4. Move - skip, dance or walkThere is often a physical aspect to joy, says Sophie Scott.\"Almost all expressions of joy involve jumping, running, movement.\"There's even the phrase \"jumping for joy\".David Larbi reckons even a tiny moment of joy can put a spring in his step. \"Today, the sun was out, and I left early. \"I was listening to the right music - Stevie Wonder,\" he says.\"So I had a little skip.\"Dancing and listening to music you love are both great ways to give yourself an \"endorphin bump,\" says Scott. Even a short walk will leave you feeling a bit better, she says.David LarbiDavid Larbi says joy doesn't have to be about big eventsAna recommends salsa classes, something she has been doing for a decade, as another thing that brings her joy.Dancing, she says, allows the kind of casual social interactions that are no longer as common in our work-from-home, shop-online environment, and a physical closeness.\"When you dance close, you touch. That human aspect feels good.\"Getty Images5. Remember, winter isn't out to get youDavid Larbi says the more you look for ways to find joy, the more obvious they become.\"The good thing about doing that is, the more of those small moments you notice, the happier you are, and the more likely you are to notice them.\"He shares his upbeat philosophy on social media, and has published a book, Frequently Happy, encouraging people to look for uplifting moments in the everyday.And if sometimes in the middle of January, it feels as though winter is out to get you, with its biting winds and long nights, he says, remember, it is nothing personal.\"Winter is not actively malicious,\" he says. \"It is just the earth doing what it has to do.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "Forecasters are predicting a colder spell of weather to take hold in the UK for the end of January and into the start of February.A battle between cold air from the east and milder conditions from the west will be taking place this week, with a growing likelihood of colder air winning into next week.Some places will see an increased chance of sleet and snow although details remain uncertain at time stage.However, before the colder conditions kick in we're expecting another round of wet and windy weather to dominate for the next few days. Low pressure moving in from the south-west on Tuesday will bring a spell of heavy rain and strong winds initially to the western half of the British Isles. By midweek those wet and windy conditions will spread across the UK. The Met Office has issued various weather warnings over the next few days, including a yellow warning for wind in south-west England on Tuesday and a heavy rain warning in eastern Scotland from Wednesday into Friday.Slightly colder weather is expected across northern areas on Thursday and into Friday, with some snow likely over high ground in Scotland, especially across the Grampians and Highlands.For most areas temperatures are set to stay around the January average for the rest of the week, then will fall below average over the weekend and throughout the final week of January.Whilst several longer-range weather forecasting models are starting to agree that temperatures are going to drop more widely towards the end of the month, the change will not be clear-cut. With high pressure expected to the east and lower pressure to the west, the UK will lie just on boundary between cold and mild air.Forecasting snow in the UK is rarely straightforward because we are an island nation on the edge on a large continent. Most commonly our weather our arrives from the west - moving in from a relatively mild Atlantic. However, when we do see winds from the Arctic or from Siberia during winter, we can see spells of cold, snowy weather. The difference between precipitation falling as rain, sleet or snow can be dictated by a change in just a degree or two, meaning forecasters often won't firm up on any snow detail until a few days in advanced. Keep an eye on the latest thoughts from the BBC Weather team on our website and via the BBC Weather App. ",

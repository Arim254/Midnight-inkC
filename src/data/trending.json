    "body": "3 hours agoJessica RawnsleyUK ParliamentAndrew Rosindell has resigned from the Conservative Party and defected to Reform UK.The former shadow minister and MP for Romford said the Tories were \"irreparably bound to the mistakes of previous governments\" and not willing to take \"meaningful accountability\" for poor decisions. He said he had spoken to Nigel Farage on Sunday evening before agreeing to join his party. The Reform UK leader called him \"a great patriot\" who \"will be a great addition to our team\".A Conservative source said Rosindell's departure was a prime example of Farage doing Badenoch's \"spring cleaning\" and that Reform was \"welcome\" to him.Rosindell's move comes after Robert Jenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after being sacked from the shadow cabinet by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who had accused him of plotting to defect.Rosindell said in a statement on X that the \"views and concerns of constituents such as mine in Romford have been consistently ignored for far too long\".\"Our country has endured a generation of managed decline,\" he added. \"Radical action is now required to reverse the damaging decisions of the past and to forge a new course for Britain.\"Rosindell, who was shadow minister for foreign affairs before his resignation, said he had joined the Conservative Party when he was 14.He cited the Labour government's decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and the \"failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition to actively hold the government to account on the issue\" as among the reasons for his defection.\"Both the government and the opposition have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power,\" he said.Farage said: \"The Tories' lies and hypocrisy over the Chagos Islands betrayal has tipped him over the edge, and we are delighted to welcome him to our ranks.\"The move comes hours after the Reform leader insisted his party was \"not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and would not become the Conservative Party 2.0.Reform will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May, he wrote in the Daily Telegraph.A Conservative source said Rosindell had been \"threatening to defect for months, denying it was happening as recently as Saturday\". They added: \"We're not going to be distracted from holding this disastrous Labour government to account.\"The Labour Party chair Anna Turley said: \"The stench of a failed and dying Tory Party now engulfs Reform.\"Nigel Farage is now unconditionally trying to rehabilitate their disastrous record,\" she added. \"The public won't be fooled: the Tories failed Britain and Reform want to do it all over again.\"A Liberal Democrat source said the defection was \"a change of rosette for a career politician worried about getting a P45\", adding: \"The public are fed up hearing about how Britain is broken from the very same people who broke it.\"Rosindell becomes Reform's seventh MP and the third sitting Conservative MP to join the party, following Danny Kruger and Jenrick.About 20 former Tory MPs have switched their allegiance to Reform UK, including former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who did so on Monday 12 January.Jenrick told a news conference where he announced his defection to Reform that the Tories \"broke\" the country and had \"betrayed its voters\", with the UK now \"in decline\". He later told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that the country needed a \"new and exciting\" leader \"who hasn't been part of that failed consensus\".Badenoch called it a \"good day\" for the Conservatives and said Jenrick was \"now Nigel Farage's problem\".She wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was destined to fail as it welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" she said.Correction - an earlier, breaking news version of this story incorrectly stated that Rosindell was the seventh Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK. He is actually the third sitting Conservative to switch allegiance, and takes the number of Reform UK MPs to seven.",

    "body": "10 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze.Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts.One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall.Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday \"the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\".A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoRachel Hagan,BBC NewsandHarry Sekulich,BBC NewsAt least 21 people have been killed after a crash involving high-speed trains in southern Spain, as authorities warn the death toll could rise overnight.The incident happened near the town of Adamuz, close to the city of Cordoba, when a high-speed train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed and crashed onto a neighbouring track, rail network operator Adif said.A second train travelling in the opposite direction, from Madrid to Huelva, also derailed. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". More than 30 are being treated for serious injuries in hospital, Spain's transport minister Oscar Puente said. He added the incident appeared to be \"extremely strange\", while the official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident. He described it as like \"a nightmare\".Andalusian emergency services said at least 73 people in total were injured in the collision.The twisted wreckage of the train made it difficult to recover survivors and bodies, rescue crews said.Cordoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"According to Adif, the crash happened about ten minutes after the train left Malaga at 18:40 local time (17:40 GMT). The company said it was setting up spaces for relatives of victims at Atocha, Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Huelva stations. All rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and will remain close on Monday. The company said it will keep terminals open overnight for impacted passengers. Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Malaga, confirmed the derailment and said around 300 passengers were on board.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster with \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.In his latest update on X, he said he was among a group of passengers waiting in the \"freezing cold night\" for buses to transport them to a local sports centre.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told an RNE radio program: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoBecky Morton,political reporter,andDaniel De Simone,investigations correspondent ReutersThe government has abandoned a final debate on its Hillsborough Law following a backlash from campaigners and some Labour MPs over the extent to which it would apply to intelligence officers.The draft legislation creates a legal obligation for public authorities to co-operate with and tell the truth to inquiries.But a government amendment would have made co-operation by intelligence officers with inquiries subject to the approval of the head of their service.Bereaved families say MI5 and MI6 officers should be fully subject to the proposed law and point to a series of cases where MI5 has provided false information.The government had originally pulled just the amendment from a vote, due to be held on Monday, before it scrapped the entire third reading of the bill - when a draft law is tidied up before going to the Lords.A government spokesperson said it would continue to work with all parties to strengthen the bill \"without compromising national security\".Removing the amendment was earlier welcomed by the Hillsborough Law Now campaign group, which said it would \"engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security\".The proposed law - named after the football stadium in Sheffield where a deadly crush occurred in 1989 - aims to make public authorities and officials more accountable for failings.The government argued that its amendments on the intelligence services sought to balance the law's new duties with protecting national security.Ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Labour MPs, with around 30 backing a proposal by Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne that would ensure the legislation applied in a fuller way to intelligence officers.The government could still bring forward revised amendments when it reaches the House of Lords.Byrne - a long-standing campaigner for the law - told the BBC after the amendment was shelved: \"I think there's been an acknowledgement that their amendment was heading for defeat, and thank God they've withdrawn it.\"However, he added: \"I won't vote for any law to leave the Commons until myself and the families are happy with what it contains...\"I have spoken to some families, and they are absolutely firm that it has to be the full Hillsborough Law before it leaves the Commons.\"It is understood that Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee did not support the government's proposed amendment, posing an additional problem for ministers, because their amendment had proposed an oversight role for the ISC.It is also understood that, amid increasing government concern about a rebellion, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum was personally involved in speaking to some MPs.The draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, is designed to stop cover-ups and would place the same \"duty of candour\" on public officials.However, campaigners had argued that giving those leading the intelligence services approval over disclosures would allow them to choose what could be made public, and said they could not support the bill in its current form.Families bereaved by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack had also called for the law to apply fully to the intelligence services.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.The Labour mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham, had also criticised the government's amendment, saying it created \"too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation\".A government spokesperson said: \"This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve, and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.\"The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.\"Earlier, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy had told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme she was confident the government would be able to resolve disagreements over the bill before Monday's vote.She insisted security services would not be exempt from the legislation but said ministers faced the challenge of ensuring officers, who often held confidential information, could continue to do their jobs.Nandy added the government wanted to make sure \"we never ever end up in a situation like we did with the Manchester Arena inquiry... where the security services are able to withhold information and present an inaccurate picture to families and to a public inquiry for a very long time\".The Hillsborough Law is the result of campaigning by families affected by the stadium crush, which led to the death of 97 football fans.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about the disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are weary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.In a Sunday interview on CBS Face the Nation, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned Trump's threat to send more troops into the city, saying the existing presence of federal ICE agents is already an \"occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city\".\"You can go through whatever rhetorical flourish you want, but when you have 3,000 ICE agents and border control come to the city, when you've got this supposed threat of 1,500 military coming to the city, yeah, that's very much what it feels like,\" Frey said.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sunday interview on CBS's Face the Nation that the judge's ruling is \"a little ridiculous\" because it \"didn't change anything\". \"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "9 hours agoGuy LambertCulture reporterThe BBC has called on the makers of The Apprentice to carry out stricter background checks on contestants, after one due to appear on the forthcoming series was found to have made offensive posts on social media.The messages from candidate Levi Hodgetts-Hague included discriminatory remarks towards Muslims and sexist comments about women, according to the Sun on Sunday, which first revealed the posts. Naked, the production company behind the award-winning show, said social media checks had \"failed to flag the offensive posts\", and that the process would be reviewed.Hodgetts-Hague has apologised for the posts, which have subsequently been deleted.The messages from Hodgetts-Hague, from South Yorkshire, are said to have included attacks on Islam and used derogatory language to refer to women.In other published posts from 2013 he reportedly expressed support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.BBC News has not seen the posts following the closure of the candidate's social media account.A BBC spokesperson said the views presented in the posts were \"totally unacceptable\" and the organisation was taking this \"extremely seriously\".\"We were completely unaware that this contestant had made such abhorrent comments,\" they said.\"We have asked the independent production company to fully review the social media checks undertaken given the process has clearly failed in this instance.\"The show presented by Lord Sugar is set to launch its 20th series on 29 January in which 20 candidates will compete for the chance to win £250,000 and go into business with the tycoon.Filming concluded in 2025, meaning Hodgetts-Hague will still appear in the programme.In a statement issued to The Sun on Sunday, Hodgetts-Hague said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" by the posts he made more than a decade ago.\"I offer my sincere apologies to all who I've offended, as well as my fellow candidates, for the truly awful language and views that they contain,\" he said.\"I take full accountability for the publishing of those posts. They are not a reflection of the values I uphold today.\"I would like to apologise for my actions, as well as to the production team for failing to bring this account to their attention.\"Production company Naked said it worked with \"reputable third-party providers\" to carry out comprehensive background and social media checks on all candidates.This is part of the company's \"rigorous due diligence\" before casting, a spokesperson said.\"On this occasion, these checks failed to flag the offensive posts, therefore we will be reviewing this process moving forward.\"\"Levi's historical posts contain language which is unacceptable and Levi has been spoken to about this behaviour,\" they added. \"He has apologised and insists that these posts do not reflect the man he is now.\"Earlier this week, a separate former Apprentice contestant, Dr Asif Munaf, was struck off the medical register after a tribunal found he posted antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media.Munaf, a candidate on series 18 in 2024, posted or reposted a total of 36 \"seriously offensive\" comments on X between October 2023 and July 2025.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

At least 20,000 have been evacuated. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media show pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling a total of 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. \"All resources are available,\" he added.The fires have affected 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) in the two regions so far, local media say.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames amid summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the next two days.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsrael's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Netanyahu's office has since said this was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza.The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited.The \"Gaza Executive Board\" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the \"founding Executive Board\" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy.So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

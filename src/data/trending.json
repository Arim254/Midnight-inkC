Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "30 minutes agoEPA/ ShutterstockFlight delays and cancellations continue to snarl US air travel for a third day as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned air traffic will be \"reduced to a trickle\" if the US government shutdown continues.Roughly 1,400 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled and 2,700 delayed on Sunday morning, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The longest delays were reported in Newark, New Jersey – more than two hours on average.In a hopeful sign, lawmakers are working on a possible deal to reach a compromise on government funding and end the shutdown, according to US media reports. The Senate was scheduled to convene on Sunday in a rare weekend session.Duffy warned the impacts on air travel will grow dire if they do not break the stalemate soon.\"You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\" he said on CNN on Sunday. He added that travellers trying to fly home for the Thanksgiving holiday later this month may not be able to get there.\"Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,\" he said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced last week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to 6% this weekend and 10% by next weekend at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. The cuts do not apply to international flights, but some airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, the FAA said.Air traffic controllers, who are not being paid during the shutdown, are reportedly fatigued and not coming to work, triggering the reductions in air traffic allowances. Duffy said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered to have military air traffic controllers step in to help but he declined the offer because they are not certified to direct air traffic at the civilian airports.Altogether, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not being paid since the Government ran out of money on 1 October. Food assistance for low-income Americans also has been in limbo, with the administration agreeing to pay only half of monthly benefits.   Sunday marked the 40th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.Republicans and Democrats have blamed each other for causing the impasse and for the travel disruptions. The White House on Friday said Democrats are \"inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving\".Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on Saturday accused Republicans  of \"playing games with people's livelihoods\".Democrats have refused to back any Republican spending plan unless money for health insurance subsidies be included, while Republicans want to provide funding for the government without anything else attached.   President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend money should be sent directly to Americans to buy health insurance rather than to insurance companies. Republican senators are working on a compromise package that could end the impasse with a vote to advance legislation possibly coming on Sunday.",

Ten people have been rescued and the body of a woman was found floating in the sea. Maritime officials believe the victims are part of a group of about 300 people who had been travelling on a larger vessel before splitting onto small boats as they approached Malaysia. Those rescued near the Malaysian resort of Langkawi include three Myanmar men, two Rohingya men and one Bangladeshi man, according Malaysia's state-run agency Bernama quoting a police chief. The body found in the water was that of a Rohingya woman, the report added. Efforts to look for more survivors are under way.The mostly-Muslim Rohinga community has fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar in huge number in recent years to escape persecution. Conflict and conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh have also continued to push vulnerable people onto overcrowded vessels as they seek a better life in Malaysia. Officials say many of those fleeing would have paid more than $3,000 (£2,300) for passage.",

    "body": "Three people died and 15 more were injured after powerful waves battered popular Spanish holiday island Tenerife. A woman died after being pulled into the ocean near the the Puerto de la Cruz resort and a man died at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emergency services said on Sunday. A third man was found dead in the ocean near a beach in Granadilla.Emergency services have told the public to stay away from coastal paths and to avoid taking pictures and videos of the rough seas, as the turbulent weather continues. Rescue services said they airlifted a man who fell into water at La Guancha in the north of the island, but that he was later pronounced dead at hospital. They said another man died after he was found floating near a beach at El Cabezo in the south, with lifeguards and medical staff unable to resuscitate him. At Puerto de la Cruz, a holiday resort in northern Tenerife, one woman died of a heart attack and another 10 people were swept out to sea. Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital.A local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out. \"As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,\" he said. Eyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but \"they did not pay attention\".Officials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards. They warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise \"extreme caution\".",

    "body": "The Trump administration is ordering US states to stop paying full food aid benefits to low-income American families, saying they are \"unauthorized\". A memo from the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), said states can deliver just 65% of benefits after the Supreme Court allowed the administration to withhold some funding pending further legal hearings.More than 42 million Americans who rely on the food aid began receiving only partial benefits this month due to the ongoing US government shutdown. Some states had been issuing full benefits after a federal judge last week ordered the Trump administration to fully fund the programme. The USDA memo directs states, which administer the programme that relies on federal funds, to stop paying out 100% of November's benefits and to claw back any funds they have already distributed above the 65% threshold.\"States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the USDA said in its Saturday memo. If states don't comply with the latest guidance, the agency warned it may cancel federal funding for state administrative costs, and hold states \"liable for any overissuances\".The BBC has contacted the White House and the USDA for comment. The latest memo comes after the USDA told states on Friday that it is working towards issuing full benefits as it sought to comply with a lower court order requiring it to do so using emergency funds. The Supreme Court later paused that lower court order. New York, Massachusetts, California, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are among the states who had begun paying out full benefits to Snap recipients. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote in a Sunday post on X that his response to the request to return the benefits was a simple \"no\". Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey said in a statement that if \"President Trump wants to penalize states for preventing Americans from going hungry, we will see him in court\". The Democratic governor said the funds had already been sent to recipients late last week in accordance with the earlier guidance received from the USDA.The clawback request is the Trump administration's latest move in the funding battle over Snap, also known as food stamps, as the longest government shutdown in US history drags on. The legal saga was spurred after the USDA announced benefits would be halted in November due to the lack of funding over the shutdown.On Friday night, the Supreme Court issued an emergency order temporarily allowing the Trump administration to temporarily withhold $4bn (£3.04bn) of funding for the benefits while it appeals the lower court's order. The Snap programme is used by around one in eight Americans and costs almost $9bn (£6.9bn) a month.A family of four on average receives $715 per month, which breaks down to a little less than $6 per day, per person.",

    "body": "In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.The first two mysteries were swiftly settled. The thieves' carelessness with DNA allowed police to work out their identities. The Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. \"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\". \"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

Both have been bailed and are due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on 25 March.'Patient safety concerns'A undercover Panorama reporter filmed staff at the Edenfield Centre - one of the UK's biggest mental health hospitals - using restraint inappropriately and patients enduring long periods of seclusion in small, bare rooms.Staff swore at patients and on occasion were seen slapping or pinching them.Some workers were sacked after the BBC's findings were broadcast.The programme sparked an independent report, which found Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust repeatedly missed opportunities to act on concerns and had a culture of \"suppressing bad news\".The trust was again rated \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission earlier this year despite some improvements having been made.Criticisms included issues with patient safety and pressures on staff, with some still feeling unable to speak up about their concerns.The Edenfield site has since been rebranded as the Riverside Centre.Related links",

    "body": "30 minutes agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Israel has received the body of Lt Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in an ambush by Hamas in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then.The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée.Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home.\"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\"Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\".Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages.Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.ReutersLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an \"immediate threat\".Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said.Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry.",

    "body": "Super typhoon makes landfall in Philippines as nearly a million evacuated4 hours agoKathryn Armstrong, André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.The storm was upgraded to a super typhoon before landfall, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the Philippines's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). The country's meteorological service warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge\" as the typhoon moves north-westerly across Luzon.Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left devastation and nearly 200 people dead.Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty ImageA landslide-hit residential area in Guinobatan town, Albay province, south of ManilaIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. \"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "Bend It Like Beckham director has a sequel - and a spin on a Christmas classic18 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterChristmas KarmaGurinder Chadha has written and directed a new festive film, Christmas KarmaWhat does Bollywood have to do with Christmas?I put this question to film director Gurinder Chadha and the answer, it turns out, is quite a lot.\"Bollywood is all about singing, dancing, joy,\" she said. \"So I think that for me, the idea of making a joyful Christmas film, with singing and dancing, it comes naturally for this time of year.\"And that's exactly what Chadha - best known for directing the 2002 film Bend It Like Beckham - has just done.With a cast including Kunal Nayyar, Hugh Bonneville, Pixie Lott, Boy George, Danny Dyer, Charithra Chandran and Eva Longoria, her new musical film Christmas Karma is a Bollywood spin on Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol.But Chadha says it's also \"a British film\" celebrating a wide range of musical traditions.The 65-year-old, who wrote and directed it, has also been busy working on her sequel to Bend It Like Beckham. This summer, she confirmed to the BBC that a revival is in the works.Speaking to me at a central London hotel earlier this week, she indicated she was feeling the pressure to get it right.“I’m working on the characters. These are big boots to fill,” she said. “I don’t want to rush it. The last thing I want is people to go, 'it's not as good as the original'.”Christmas KarmaThe Big Bang Theory's Kunal Nayyar stars as a contemporary Scrooge, called Mr SoodFirst published in 1843, A Christmas Carol tells the story of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who hates Christmas, but is transformed after a series of ghostly visits.In Christmas Karma, we are met with a modern-day Scrooge called Mr Sood, who goes on a similar journey of redemption.Nayyar, best known for playing Raj in The Big Bang Theory, plays Mr Sood - but says he is nothing like Scrooge in real life. \"I love Christmas,\" he tells me. \"Who doesn't love Christmas? Of course I love Christmas.\"The actor said he always celebrated Christmas growing up in New Delhi. \"Indians have a beautiful procurement to celebrate all festivals,\" he said.Christmas KarmaHugh Bonneville is barely recognisable as the ghost of Jacob MarleyThe first ghost to visit Mr Sood is his former partner, Jacob Marley, played by Paddington and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville.He's also visited by American singer and actor Billy Porter, who acts as The Ghost of Christmas Present.Porter says that up until this film, he was \"definitely\" more of a Scrooge.But Bonneville professes to be a huge Christmas fan. He also rejects suggestions that November is too early for a festive film to come out in cinemas.\"I used to be Bah Humbug about it, and want Christmas decorations to go up on, frankly, Boxing Day, but I'm getting earlier and earlier,\" he said.\"Although I do draw the line at certain Christmas songs being played too early, I think they should be banned.\"As a sidenote, I had to ask Bonneville about whether he's planning to go and see the new Paddington musical. \"I'm going next week,\" he told me. \"I'm looking forward to seeing that equally timeless story being told.\"Christmas KarmaIn the film, Danny Dyer plays a cabbie who drives around Kunal Nayyar's ScroogeIn Christmas Karma, Mr Sood is depicted as being among the 28,000 Ugandan Asian refugees who came to the UK in 1972 after being given 90 days to leave the African country by military dictator Idi Amin.In later life, we see Mr Sood being dismissive of refugees seeking asylum in the UK. \"The rich ones always forget their roots,\" one bystander remarks.But after being guided by the ghosts of Christmas - played by Eva Longoria, Billy Porter, and Boy George - Mr Sood reconnects with his past.Chadha says the inspiration for her Scrooge came from a “Grinch-like” family member who used to criticise them for celebrating Christmas. “‘I don’t know why you’re all doing this. You’re not white’,” she says he would tell them.Later, she came to understand that, like Mr Sood, he was “carrying the trauma” of having been forced to leave his home country as a child.But she also says she was inspired by certain politicians.“It also made sense to me to make my Sood say slightly right-wing things, because when I was writing it [during lockdown], we did have a government that had members of the Asian community who would have a similar background,” she said.Christmas KarmaLeo Suter and Pixie Lott star as a couple celebrating Christmas with their childrenFor Leo Suter, who plays Mr Sood's underpaid employee Bob Crachett, there’s an important message he hopes people take away from the film.“Dickens's work has lasted… a very long time, because of the message at the core of it. The original text is that empathy, morality, generosity is better than being a Scrooge and being miserly,” he said.“And what the film does so well is totally bring that spirit into quite a complex and nuanced discussion of migration and racial things going on in modern Britain,” he said.The film also has a Bhangra Christmas song, and a tribute to George Michael with Bollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra Jonas singing a desi take on Last Christmas.“I feel like it's got all the things that you want in a Christmas film,” adds Pixie Lott, who plays Suter's on-screen wife Mary Crachett.“It makes you cry, it makes you laugh. It's so feel good, but it also touches you in a way that makes you think about your own life.”Christmas Karma is in cinemas from 14 November.",

    "body": "7 hours agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"Britain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said.Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way.Brussels Airport was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting \"hybrid warfare\" on allies of Ukraine.Sir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands.Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Instagram/Royal Air Force RegimentThe RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing was deployed in an anti-drone role to the Paris Olympics in 2024Sir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts.\"He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which \"we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato. The shadow defence secretary welcomed the decision to assist Belgium, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and that a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".The incursion into Belgian airspace follows similar incursions across European nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. All are Nato allies that have provided support to Ukraine.While some have pointed the finger at Russia, officials have not produced evidence linking the incursions to Moscow, while the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement.Suspicions have been fuelled by more overt airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe in recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones. Mocow has denied these were intentional.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to EU-wide discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.",

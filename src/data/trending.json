This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

The Chair of the BBC, Samir Shah said “the BBC would like to apologise for that error of judgement”.\nThe BBC has been given a Friday deadline by Trump to respond or face possible legal action, with the US president threatening to sue the corporation for a billion dollars.   \nAnthony and Marianna speak to Elie Honig, CNN’s Senior Legal Analyst who assesses the likelihood of the case ending up in court, and how any damages could be calculated. We also look at whether any of Trump’s previous legal actions against other media outlets can predict how this dispute may play out.\nPlus, newly released emails between Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein from 2011 allege that Donald Trump 'spent hours' with one of Epstein’s victims. The documents have been published by House Democrats and refer to the president as the \"dog that hasn't barked.” Donald Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and has accused Democrats of “trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they’ll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they’ve done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects.”\nAnthony and Marianna unpack what this means for the administration and whether it could affect the president’s approval ratings.\nHOSTS:\n* Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations correspondent\n* Anthony Zurcher, North America correspondent\nGUEST:\n* Elie Honig, Senior Legal Analyst at CNN\nGET IN TOUCH:\n* Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n* Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n* Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n* Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

    "body": "12 minutes agoChris Mason,Political editor and Kate Whannel,Political reporterHouse of CommonsChancellor Rachel Reeves has decided against raising income tax rates at the Budget later this month.In recent weeks, Reeves had given strong indications she would increase the rates - a move that would have broken Labour's election manifesto promise not to raise \"the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax\".However, as first reported in the Financial Times, the chancellor has decided against taking the step, partly due to better-than-expected economic forecasts. Instead of raising income tax rates, the chancellor could opt to freeze or lower income tax thresholds, the salary levels at which the various rates kick in. Other taxes could also be raised. Government sources maintain that they are still having to make what they call \"tough choices\".They also stress that the move was not related to the turbulence in recent days relating to the prime minister's future.Ahead of every Budget, the chancellor submits its plans to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which then make forecasts on whether the government will spend more money than it raises and whether the economy will grow or shrink.The chancellor's latest measures are believed to have been submitted to the OBR last week. UK government borrowing costs rose in reaction to reports about income tax rates.But yields eased through the morning after further reports that the financial hole facing the government was going to be less than experts have been predicting.Chancellors never comment publicly on what will be in their Budgets but they do prepare the ground - also known as \"pitch rolling\" - for any big changes that might be coming.And in the months running up to this year's financial statement, Labour ministers have repeatedly given strong indications that income tax rates would go up. In October, the prime minister declined to repeat his previous promises not to increase key taxes, despite being asked to do so by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch at Prime Minister's Questions. Earlier this month, Reeves took the unusual step of making a pre-Budget speech to warn about the need for \"necessary choices\" and said everyone would have to \"contribute\". And on Monday, she told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"If the chancellor has decided not to increase income tax rates, she will have to explore other ways to raise money, in order to meet her self-imposed rules on debt and borrowing while filling a hole in the public finances of around £20bn. She could still opt to extend a freeze on income tax and National Insurance (NI) thresholds. The freeze was introduced in April 2023 and had been due to expire in 2028.  That would mean as salaries rise more people would be pulled above the income threshold at which point they either start paying tax and NI or qualify for higher tax rates. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates extending the freeze by two years could raise £8.3bn a year and would mean someone on the minimum wage would be liable to pay income tax if they worked just 18 hours a week. Another option would be to lower the thresholds which would raise more money than simply extending the freeze. There have been reports the Treasury is also considering other measures including a new tax on electric vehicles and higher taxes on gambling companies. In its 2024 general election manifesto, Labour promised that it would \"not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT\".Breaking the manifesto promise would mean difficult questions for Labour ministers and MPs ahead of elections in Scotland, Wales and England. At the start of the month, the party's newly-elected deputy leader Lucy Powell, said: \"It is really important we stand by the promises that we were elected on and that we do what we said we would do.\"Health Secretary Wes Streeting said it was \"really important that we keep our promises and that we stand by our manifesto\".He added that talk about tax rises demonstrated how \"challenging\" the situation in public finances was, but that it was \"wise to stop speculating\"  and \"wait for the Budget\".Kemi Badenoch said: \"One retreat doesn't fix a Budget built on broken promises. \"Reeves must guarantee no new taxes on work, businesses, homes or pensions - and she should go further by abolishing stamp duty.\"Liberal Democrat Business spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"The chancellor gave a press conference to trail her income tax hikes. \"She must come before the British public today, unroll that particular pitch and come clean on what on earth is going on at the Treasury.\"The SNP social justice secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the UK government was in \"complete disarray\".A Treasury spokesperson said: \"We do not comment on speculation around changes to tax outside of fiscal events.\"They added: \"The chancellor will deliver a Budget that takes the fair choices to build strong foundations to secure Britain's future.\"",

    "body": "12 minutes agoTheo LeggettBusiness correspondentJaguar Land Rover has reported a heavy loss for the three months to the end of September, a period during which it was badly affected by the impact of a serious cyber-attack.The carmaker posted a £485m loss – before tax and exceptional items - compared with a profit of £398m for the same period a year ago.The cyber-attack, which took place at the end of August, forced JLR to shut down its computer networks, leaving it unable to operate its highly-automated production lines throughout September and into early October.Car sales to consumers were also affected initially, although JLR was later able to develop workarounds, and parts supply to service outlets was badly disrupted.The company says production has now returned to normal levels.JLR also reported additional \"cyber related costs\" of £196m, on top of the headline loss. These are understood to include the costs of bringing in outside consultants and other support in response to the hacking attack.According to the carmaker, its revenues for the quarter fell 24%, from £6.5bn last year to £4.5bn.This was heavily affected by the production stoppage. However, the effects of US tariffs on exports from both the UK and Slovakia also had an impact, as did the phasing out of a number of Jaguar models ahead of the brands planned re-launch as an all-electric marque.The crisis at JLR helped drive UK car production in September to its lowest level for the month since 1952, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Its impact was also felt well beyond JLR itself. According to the Office for National Statistics, the drop in production of some 27,000 vehicles knocked 0.17% off economic output in September.The company sits at the top of a large and complex supply chain involving thousands of businesses worldwide, including hundreds in the UK, many of whom are heavily reliant on orders from the carmaker.The stoppage meant a large number of them, including small and medium sized businesses, were also forced to shut some or all of their operations – prompting warnings of potential bankruptcies.The government agreed to provide guarantees for JLR to obtain loans worth up to £1.5bn in order to help its supply chain.Separately, the carmaker itself set up a financing scheme, allowing suppliers to obtain early payment for new orders, in order to ease their cashflow.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentA new photograph of King Charles marking his 77th birthday has been issued by Buckingham Palace.The picture, taken by Millie Pilkington, shows the King at his Sandringham estate in Norfolk, holding a shepherd's crook.It was published on social media with a balloon emoji and the message: \"77 today! Thank you for the kind words and well wishes on His Majesty's Birthday.\"King Charles is spending his birthday in South Wales accompanied by Queen Camilla, where their engagements will include meeting Ruth Jones, star of the BBC's Gavin and Stacey.It's not known if the King would agree that celebrating his birthday with the actress who played Nessa was \"tidy\".There will be a reception at Cyfarthfa Castle in Merthyr Tydfil, which is celebrating its own 200th anniversary, where there are plans for a birthday cake for the King.The visit to South Wales comes at the same time as Storm Claudia, which is forecast to bring heavy rain.It's been a stormy few weeks for the royals too, with the removal of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's title and his status as prince, over links to the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The scandal has cast a shadow over what otherwise has been a busy autumn schedule for the King, with the state visit by US President Donald Trump, the King's historic meeting with Pope Leo at the Vatican and this week's annual Remembrance events.The trip to South Wales is a sign of the King's determination to keep working, even though he is still receiving regular cancer treatment.Although this is only the third year of his reign, Charles at the age of 77 is now in fifth place in the longest-lived British monarchs.He recently overtook George II, who in 1760 died a few days short of his 77th birthday.The longest living monarchs were Elizabeth II, Victoria, George III and Edward VIII - who abdicated in 1936.",

    "body": "55 minutes agoDavid GrittenReutersAlaa Abdel Fattah celebrated with his mother, Leila Souief (left), and his sister, Sanaa Seif (right), following his release from prison in SeptemberBritish-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah was stopped from flying to the UK by Egyptian passport control earlier this week, his family says.Mr Abdel Fattah, 43, was Egypt's best known political prisoner until seven weeks ago, when he was released from jail after being granted a pardon by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.He attempted to fly to London on Tuesday with his sister Sanaa, but was told by officials at Cairo International Airport that he was not allowed to travel. \"They blocked him from boarding the flight and I had to go alone,\" Sanaa told the BBC's Today programme on Friday. There was no immediate comment from the Egyptian government.\"They didn't explain much. Our lawyers in Egypt are trying to understand the legal grounds,\" Sanaa said. She added that her brother had his British passport as well as a recently renewed Egyptian passport.\"I assumed after the renewal of the Egyptian passport that he would be allowed.\"Alaa Abdel Fattah's 13-year-old son, Khaled, lives with his mother in Brighton, where he attends a special needs school because he is on the autism spectrum.Khaled spent a month visiting his father in Cairo following his release from prison, but he has now returned to the UK.\"We're really glad to have [Alaa] back in our lives partially free, but he needs to have freedom of movement to live with his son, reunited with him properly,\" Ms Seif said.She added: \"Khaled needs his father. My nephew… is very, very comfortable in his school and his set-up in Brighton. We can't change. We can't keep creating instability.\"Ms Seif said the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office had been communicating with her family over the issue, but she called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's office to also give it their attention.The FCDO said in a statement: \"President Sisi's decision to pardon and release Alaa Abdel Fattah was extremely welcome news and a significant step forward.\"\"We continue to press for his urgent return to the UK at the highest levels with the Egyptian government so he can be reunited with his family. The case remains a priority issue for the UK government.\"On Thursday night, Alaa Abdel Fattah and his mother were given the 2025 Magnitsky Award for \"Courage Under Fire\". Sanaa had to collect the award on their behalf.Mr Abdel Fattah rose to prominence during the 2011 uprising in Egypt that forced long-time President Hosni Mubarak to resign.He spent most of his time in prison after 2014, the year after Sisi led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi, following anti-government protests.While in power, Sisi has overseen what human rights groups say is an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has led to the detention of thousands of people.In 2015, a court sentenced Mr Abdel Fattah to five years in prison for participating in an unauthorised protest.In September 2019, only six months after he had been released on probation, he was arrested again and held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.He was convicted in December 2021 of \"spreading false news\" for sharing a post about a prisoner dying of torture and handed another five-year sentence following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.His 68-year-old mother, Leila, launched a 287-day hunger strike last September 2024 to protest against his imprisonment. She lost more than 40% of her original body weight and was twice admitted to hospital in London.",

    "body": "2 hours agoChris DeardenBBC WalesTerry StewartMembers of the Royal Naval Association in Llandudno spotted a man wearing an unusual uniformOfficials are looking into whether a man who took part in a Remembrance Sunday ceremony dressed as a high-ranking navy officer was a fake.The man was involved in the wreath laying in Llandudno, Conwy county on Sunday, and saluted the war memorial before marching away with a colleague.Serving and former service personnel became suspicious when they saw him dressed as a Rear Admiral and wearing the rare Distinguished Service Order medal.The Ministry of Defence said it was taking the matter very seriously, adding that impersonating a naval officer can be considered a criminal offence.Hundreds of people were on the seafront in Llandudno last weekend for the traditional period of silence and laying of poppy wreaths to mark Remembrance Sunday.But members of the town's Royal Naval Association spotted a man wearing a rare uniform among the ranks of serving and former servicemen and women.The man was wearing the epaulettes and sleeve lace of a Rear Admiral, a two-star position that is one of the highest ranks in the Royal Navy.He also wore an array of medals on his chest, including the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), which is awarded for highly successful command and leadership during active operations, and which very few personnel have been awarded since 1979.Rear Admiral Dr Chris Parry, who held the position between 2005 and 2008, told the BBC that a small percentage of those who join the navy reach Rear Admiral. \"You're eight ranks up and two down from the head of the navy, and you never lose the rank,\" he said, adding a serviceman must perform \"very well\" in order to obtain the ranking.He added the presence of the DSO medal on the man's chest was an \"easy spot\" because it is such an exceptional award.\"It's one down from the Victoria Cross,\" he said.Hundreds of people were on the seafront in Llandudno to mark Remembrance Sunday last weekend.Several veterans and serving officers have expressed their concerns on social media that that the man at the wreath-laying ceremony in Llandudno last weekend may not have been a Rear Admiral - and may not have earned all the medals he was wearing.Llandudno Town Council, which organised the event, confirmed that no-one of that rank had been due to attend the ceremony.Greg Robbins, chair of the council's civic sub-committee, said: \"The man was challenged by the parade marshal, but stated that he was of a certain rank, and that he was representing the Lord Lieutenant's office.\"The parade marshal was left with little choice but to accommodate him in the wreath-laying ceremony.\"The most important thing with Remembrance Sunday ceremonies is that they are suitably dignified, as this one was.\"This individual did not disrupt the ceremony, but we are keen to know who he was, and will be working with the Ministry of Defence on its investigation.\"The man was seen walking in formation to the war memorial with a colleague, dressed in a khaki uniform.The colleague laid a wreath, before the pair saluted and walked away together.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said: \"Impersonating a Naval officer is insulting to anyone connected to the service and can be considered a criminal offence.\"Nothing should detract from the poignancy of Remembrance Sunday, which can be a sombre time for members of the Royal Navy family, and an opportunity for people in communities across the country to pay their respects to people who have, or are, serving their country.\"More top stories",

    "body": "A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was \"free after being arrested\". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court.  The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a \"Troll Most Hated\", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December.If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. \"There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,\" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act.  \"Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?\" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of \"re-traumatising\" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\"Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?\" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos.In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security.Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned.The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.Hundreds of fans had gathered in a sea of green and pink at the Wicked: For Good Asia-Pacific premiere in a Singapore mall, including some who had stood in line for as long as eight hours before it began.The movie, to be released on 21 November, is the second of a two-part adaptation of the popular Broadway and West End musical Wicked, which centres on the unlikely friendship between two very different witches.The musical itself is a spin-off of the 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Grande, who plays the good witch Glinda, was decked out in a champagne pink sequin dress at the premiere while Erivo, who plays the wicked witch, wore a black tube grown embroidered with roses.They were joined by co-star Jeff Goldblum who plays the wizard.The first movie, Wicked, was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations, winning two for best costume and production design.",

    "body": "17 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent, BBC NewsVictoria Gill/BBC NewsMy own dog seems a long way from a wild wolfIf you, like me, have a spoiled, lazy dog that enjoys cheese flavoured treats, the fact that your pet's ancestors were wild predators can seem unfathomable.But a major new study suggests their physical transformation from wolf to sofa-hogging furball began in the Middle Stone Age, much earlier than we previously thought.\"When you see a Chihuahua - it's a wolf that's been living with humans for so long that it's been modified,\" says Dr Allowen Evin from the University of Montpellier, a lead researcher on this study.She and her colleagues discovered that the transformation of our pets championed by the Victorians through selective breeding actually started more than 10,000 years ago.C AmeenThe researchers studied more than 600 skulls that spanned 50,000 years of dog and wolf evolutionIn a paper published in the journal Science, this international team of researchers focused their attention on prehistoric canine skulls. Over more than a decade, they collected, examined and scanned bones that spanned a period of 50,000 years of dog evolution.They created digital 3D models of each of the more than 600 skulls they examined - and compared specific features across ancient and modern dogs - and their wild relatives.This revealed that, nearly 11,000 years ago, just after the last ice age, dog skulls started to change shape. While there were still slender, wolf-like dogs, there were also many with shorter snouts and wider, stockier heads.Dr Carly Ameen from the University of Exeter, another lead researcher on this project, explained to BBC News that almost half of the diversity we see in modern dog breeds today was already present in dog populations by the middle of the Stone Age.\"It's really surprising,\" she said. \"And it starts to challenge the ideas about whether or not it was the Victorians -  and their kennel clubs - that drove this.\"C Brassard (VetAgro Sup/Mecadev)The researchers produced digital scans of each of the skulls they studied. The pink skull on the left in this image is a modern dog with a shorter snout and the green image on the right is a scan of a wolf skull. Domestication: An ancient mysteryDogs were the first animals to be domesticated. There is evidence that humans have been living closely with canines for at least 30,000 years. Where and why that close association began remains a puzzle.This study has revealed some of the earliest physical evidence of dogs transforming into the diverse array of pets, companions and working animals that we know today. And the researchers' digital scans of the skulls that they studied will allow them to answer more questions about the evolutionary driving forces behind domestication.Some researchers have suggested that humans and wolves came together almost by accident, when wolves moved to the outskirts of hunter-gatherer communities to scavenge for food.Tamer wolves would get more food, and the humans gradually came to rely on the wolves to clean up remains of messy carcasses and to raise the alarm if a predator came near.As to why that ultimately changed dogs' physical appearance, Dr Ameen said there were likely to be a number of reasons. She did not rule our ancestors preference for boxy heads and cute, snub noses but she explained: \"It's likely to be a combination of interaction with humans, adapting to different environments, adapting to different types food - all contributing to the kind of explosion of variation that we see.\"It's hard to untangle which of those might be the most important one.\"For tens of thousands of years, our human story and that of our dogs has been entangled. In another paper in this same edition of the journal Science, a research group led by scientists in China studied ancient DNA from dogs that lived between 9,700 and 870 years ago - at sites across Siberia, the Central Eurasian Steppe, and northwest China.They concluded that the movement of domestic dogs across that region often coincided with migrations of people - hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists. So our dogs have travelled alongside us - and been integrated into our societies - for thousands of years.I can't say that my own stubborn, disobedient terrier provides me with any of the benefits that the first domesticated wolves bestowed on our ancestors. But I can see why, as research suggests, once a dog showed up for some leftovers, there was no going back.",

Then in spring this year, cameras set up as part of the rat eradication programme caught two puffins coming and going from a nesting burrow on the cliff ledges.Their behaviour, bringing food back to the nest, was a positive sign that they were breeding.For Mr Crory, tales of puffins once breeding on the Isle of Muck \"felt more like folklore\", but the myth is now becoming a reality.\"Seabirds face immense challenges globally, with 24 of the 25 breeding species at risk of local or global extinction,\" he said.\"So, while a handful of puffins on a tiny island may seem small, this moment is huge – it proves that seabird restoration works.\"Hope for pufflings next yearThe puffin sightings are the latest in a long line of positive signs of the impact conservation management has been having on the island.Annual surveys have begun to record steady increases in eider ducks, guillemots, herring gulls and lesser-backed gulls on and around the island, year on year.It is not known for certain that the puffins seen this year managed to successfully rear a chick.But Mr Crory is staying positive.\"Our hope is that the Isle of Muck will become a thriving stronghold for puffins and, in time, tempt back other lost species like the Manx shearwater.\"For now, we're waiting with great excitement to see if the first 'pufflings' – baby puffins – appear on the cliffs next summer.\"That truly would be the icing on the cake.\"Puffins are a priority species in Northern Ireland and red-listed in the UK, putting them in the highest conservation concern bracket due to food shortages, climate change, and predation by invasive species.They spend most of their lives at sea, only returning to land to breed in spring and summer at the same nesting site with the same partner, year after year.Each pair raises a single chick during the breeding season.Ulster Wildlife said rats are a major issue for many seabird islands across the UK, posing a threat to eggs and chicks.The Isle of Muck is not accessible to the public and it is hoped that isolation will help the birds to return safely next summer.Other conservation successesSimilar rat removal projects have been carried out elsewhere to help seabirds bounce back.The LIFE Raft project on Rathlin Island is expected to have rid the island of the predators when it publishes its latest report soon.Ferrets have already been cleared from Rathlin in a world-first project.",

    "body": "1 hour agoToby Luckhurst,In Kyiv and Ottilie MitchellWatch: Kyiv air defences downing Russian drones and missiles during attackAt least four people were killed when a Russian drone penetrated an apartment block in eastern Kyiv, during a wave of strikes throughout the Ukrainian capital.Condemning the attacks as vile and calculated, President Volodymyr Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged.As emergency workers sifted through the wreckage of the block of flats in the Lisovyi area, one Kyiv resident called Vita described how the drone had pierced the building, exploding on the other side.Several other regions were also targeted. A drone attack on a market at Chornomorsk in the south of the country killed two people.The Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk was hit in an overnight Ukrainian attack. Fire broke out at the major Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and apartment blocks were hit, officials said.Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev said three crew members and another man were hurt in the attack which damaged the main oil depot and a container terminal.President Zelensky said Ukraine had fired long-range \"Long Neptune\" cruise missiles during its attacks on Russia overnight, without specifying what they targeted.Mayor Andrei Kravchenko has declared a state of emergency and Reuters reports that oil exports have been halted.ReutersKyiv fire service said the drone destroyed several floors of the entire block of flatsIn Kyiv, residential buildings came under attack \"in practically every district\", the head of the city's military administration Tymur Tkachenko said on Telegram.He issued a warning to take shelter a minute after midnight local time on Thursday night, writing \"it's loud in Kyiv\".The fire service in the Lisovyi neighbourhood on Kyiv's left bank said later the drone had hit the seventh floor of an apartment block. When it exploded all the floors - from the eighth down to the fourth - collapsed, a spokesman told the BBC.Vita said she saw all four bodies being pulled out of the apartment a few doors down from hers: \"I saw it with my own eyes.\"Two cranes hoisted emergency workers outside the block, as crews combed through the destroyed building, throwing broken sections of wall and shattered glass to the ground.Falling debris and fires damaged multiple high-rise apartment buildings, a hospital, school and administrative buildings, according to emergency services. Oleh Kiper/TelegramA drone killed at least two people at a market in Chornomorsk in southern UkraineMore than 40 people were rescued, they added, including 14 from a fire in a residential building. Another person was rescued after being pulled from beneath rubble, they said.Kyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. \"The attack was massive, with drones, with ballistic [missiles], with lots of air defence working,\" Ukrainian MP Lisa Yasko told the BBC. \"Very often there was the feeling that your bed was just shaking  together with the windows.\"Medical teams were deployed to all fires, officials said, while Mayor Vitali Klitschko said nine people were being treated in hospital with one man in an \"extremely serious condition\".ReutersWitnesses described how a Russian drone pierced the entire block of flats in Kyiv before explodingUkraine's air force warned drones and guided bombs had been targeting several other regions, including Sumy.The overnight strikes follow the deaths of six people in another Russian offensive less than a week ago that also damaged residential buildings and energy infrastructure. Russia says its attacks on energy targets, now a familiar part of the war, are aimed at the Ukrainian military, although Kyiv has long rejected that claim.President Zelensky has called for \"no exceptions\" to Western sanctions on Russian energy - although shortly after the US granted Hungary one such exemption. US President Donald Trump had initially announced the sanctions on Russian oil after saying ceasefire talks with Russian President Vladimir were not progressing. ",

    "body": "11 hours agoEmily HoltRebecca MiddletonWhen Rebecca Middleton became pregnant, she had no idea that she would end up in a wheelchair for the final three months before she gave birth. Rebecca had had a difficult first trimester dealing with nausea and sickness, and began to develop pelvic pain four months into her pregnancy. \"I could hardly walk, I'd always had some problems with lower back pain in my life. But nothing that significant and it escalated quite quickly,\" she says. After complaining about the pain, she was referred to an NHS physio, and eventually diagnosed with an extreme case of pelvic girdle pain (PGP), also known as symphysis pubic dysfunction.Problems with your pelvic joints are a common symptom of pregnancy, affecting one in five expectant mothers to some degree.\"I was terrified, would I ever walk again? How would I have my baby, how would I care for it?\"Rebecca MiddletonRebecca now helps raise awareness of the issueAfter giving birth, Rebecca was in less pain, but she still struggled with basic things like walking, lifting her son or pushing a pram. \"I was disabled for seven months and had to have someone helping me all the time,\" she says. \"I just couldn't do the things that you should be able to do in looking after a baby, it was a really challenging time.\"Prior to becoming pregnant, it was an issue Rebecca was unaware of and since her experience she volunteers for The Pelvic Partnership, a charity which helps raise awareness and support women with this condition.It says the condition is treatable with the right action. Seek helpAs soon as your symptoms start, the charity advises you get hands-on individualised treatment, including manual therapy, and ask for a referral for NHS physiotherapy from your GP or midwife.If you aren't offered this support initially, the charity suggests going back to your GP or midwife and asking for a second opinion.They can also refer you to maternal mental health support to help you manage the emotional impacts of living with PGP.Dr Nighat Arif, a women's health specialist, says higher awareness and early assessment could prevent patients like Rebecca needing wheelchairs or crutches.\"Without that early identification based on a really good understanding of the female body, we leave some of these women with negative effects for life,\" she says.Victoria RobertonVictoria says her second pregnancy was much easier to manageVictoria Roberton, co-ordinator at the Pelvic Partnership, is an example of how awareness can help. Like Rebecca, she didn't know what PGP was when she began experiencing the condition during her first pregnancy. She tried to stay as active as possible as advised and was referred to NHS physio sessions online and by phone, but found the pain worsening as her pregnancy progressed. \"They gave us exercises, stretches to do. By this point I couldn't do any of them. It was too painful,\" she says. It got to the point where even sitting became uncomfortable for Victoria, and she was largely homebound until her baby was born. The pain lessened after the birth of her daughter, but she began experiencing the same problem when she became pregnant with her second child. It's not an option for many mothers, but Victoria said given her medical history she decided to pay for a private physio as the NHS wait for referral was long.The physio gave her a full assessment and hands-on treatment including joint mobilisation, and taught her different ways to move her body to not aggravate her hip joints, which helped ease the pain. Victoria still struggles with a degree of PGP today, four years on, but her second pregnancy was much easier to manage because she understood her condition and how to handle it.   Rebecca's second pregnancy has been similarly a much more positive experience. This time round she knew she was at risk of PGP and was able to have it treated throughout her pregnancy before it became debilitating.She has made a full recovery from PGP, just two months post birth compared to  two years for her first child. \"I'm probably in better shape now than I was before either of my children because I now know what caused that pelvic girdle pain, and have had it fully treated and resolved with manual therapy,\" she says.  \"It was five years of hell because of the pain I was in because of a lack of knowledge and understanding about the subject.\"  NHS information on pelvic pain in pregnancyOther stories you may enjoy",

    "body": "8 minutes agoJoe TidyCyber correspondent, BBC World ServiceThe makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Claude claim to have caught Chinese government hackers using the tool to perform automated cyber attacks against around 30 global organisations.Anthropic said hackers tricked the chatbot into carrying out automated tasks under the guise of carrying out cyber security research.The company claimed in a blog post this was the \"first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign\".But sceptics are questioning the accuracy of that claim - and the motive behind it.Anthropic said it discovered the hacking attempts in mid-September.Pretending they were legitimate cyber security workers, hackers gave the chatbot small automated tasks which, when strung together, formed a \"highly sophisticated espionage campaign\".Researchers at Anthropic said they had \"high confidence\" the people carrying out the attacks were \"a Chinese state-sponsored group\".They said humans chose the targets - large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies – but the company would not be more specific.Hackers then built an unspecified programme using Claude's coding assistance to \"autonomously compromise a chosen target with little human involvement\".Anthropic claims the chatbot was able to successfully breach various unnamed organisations, extract sensitive data and sort through it for valuable information.The company said it had since banned the hackers from using the chatbot and had notified affected companies and law enforcement.But Martin Zugec from cyber firm Bitdefender said the cyber security world had mixed feelings about the news. \"Anthropic's report makes bold, speculative claims but doesn't supply verifiable threat intelligence evidence,\" he said. \"Whilst the report does highlight a growing area of concern, it's important for us to be given as much information as possible about how these attacks happen so that we can assess and define the true danger of AI attacks.\"Anthropic's announcement is perhaps the most high profile example of companies claiming bad actors are using AI tools to carry out automated hacks.It is the kind of danger many have been worried about, but other AI companies have also claimed that nation state hackers have used their products.In February 2024, OpenAI published a blog post in collaboration with cyber experts from Microsoft saying it had disrupted five state-affiliated actors, including some from China.\"These actors generally sought to use OpenAI services for querying open-source information, translating, finding coding errors, and running basic coding tasks,\" the firm said at the time.Anthropic has not said how it concluded the hackers in this latest campaign were linked to the Chinese government.It comes as some cyber security companies have been criticised for over-hyping cases where AI was used by hackers.Critics say the technology is still too unwieldy to be used for automated cyber attacks.In November, cyber experts at Google released a research paper which highlighted growing concerns about AI being used by hackers to create brand new forms of malicious software.But the paper concluded the tools were not all that successful - and were only in a testing phase.The cyber security industry, like the AI business, is keen to say hackers are using the tech to target companies in order to boost the interest in their own products.In its blog post, Anthropic argued that the answer to stopping AI attackers is to use AI defenders.\"The very abilities that allow Claude to be used in these attacks also make it crucial for cyber defence,\" the company claimed.And Anthropic admitted its chatbot made mistakes. For example, it made up fake login usernames and passwords and claimed to have extracted secret information which was in fact publicly available.\"This remains an obstacle to fully autonomous cyberattacks,\" Anthropic said.",

    "body": "Media caption, How Maresca's tenure at Chelsea turned sourByFootball reporterUpdated 1 January 2026Less than six months after guiding Chelsea to Club World Cup success, Enzo Maresca has left his post as head coach.The Blues won just one of their final seven Premier League matches under Maresca and sit fifth in the table - 15 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.After their most recent game - a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth on 30 December - assistant manager Willy Caballero said Maresca felt too unwell to speak to the media, but it is understood his absence was more due to him considering his next steps.Two days on, Maresca has gone. But how did things unravel?From stability to troubleMedia caption, From Match of the Day on 13 December: What did Maresca mean?At the end of November, Chelsea appeared in a harmonious place, with the team third in the Premier League and having recently dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.On 12 December, Maresca was named Premier League manager of the month for November.Just one league win followed in December but it was not only results that added to the focus on Maresca, with fissures emerging between the Italian and the club's hierarchy.Maresca stunned key figures at Stamford Bridge - and even his own staff - when, after beating Everton 2-0 for Chelsea's solitary Premier League win in December, he said \"many people\" had made it his \"worst 48 hours\" since joining the club.Those comments came from a position of strength after a good performance but were viewed dimly by the club hierarchy, at whom they appeared to be aimed.They have since been explained as being linked to medical recommendations. Senior figures inside Chelsea said instructions were ignored and decisions either risked players getting injured again - or prevented them from training because of overload. Maresca felt the club were telling him who to pick, based on a player's value.Even after that, the plan remained to conduct an end-of-season review to decide whether to move forward with Maresca or part company.Those with knowledge of Maresca's views, though, said he was capable of walking away having grown unhappy at a multitude of factors, including encouragement over which players should start and which substitutions should be made during matches.He also felt a lack of protection from the club over the quality of his work. And on Thursday came news that was not unexpected, with Chelsea confirming the two parties had gone their separate ways. The Blues' players will return to work on Friday closer in points to 15th place than third in the Premier League as they prepare for a defining period.They face Manchester City on Sunday to start a difficult month that also includes games against Arsenal and Napoli.Chelsea's primary goal this season is to qualify for the Champions League, which remains realistic, while also aiming for domestic cup runs.What happened to Maresca behind the scenes?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Enzo Maresca's Chelsea won only once in the Premier League in DecemberChelsea were satisfied with Maresca at the end of last season when he delivered Champions League qualification - regarded internally as his most important achievement - plus success in the Conference League and Club World Cup.While victory in Europe's third-tier competition was broadly expected, beating Paris St-Germain to be crowned 'world champions' was a welcome surprise.Maresca had delighted key figures at Stamford Bridge - including sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Lawrence Stewart, and influential co-owner Behdad Eghbali.In line with the agreed strategy when the Italian moved from Leicester City in 2024 - for which the club paid £10m - he focused on coaching while those above him oversaw much of the backroom staff, medical department and transfers.Maresca knew what he was signing up for in terms of the transfer policy - signing the world's best young players from 'lesser' leagues to create the youngest team in the Premier League - and his issues were not with the quality of players or the strategy, but about the perception of his work with a young group. Maresca also did not expect decisions on team selection to be influenced.This season, he and his agent had informed the club on two occasions of interest from Manchester City. Chelsea noted it came at a time when City boss Pep Guardiola had said Maresca was the best manager in the league. Maresca had also notified the club of interest from Juventus, as well as his willingness to stay despite interest from two of Europe's biggest clubs.He indicated speculation would end if he was handed a new contract. He was only 18 months into his initial deal and contracted until 2029.Difficulties remained in his working relationship with the Chelsea ownership.The Italian was encouraged to rotate his squad, but often felt that when he did so in the Premier League, they dropped points. He openly urged reporters to question the club's hierarchy but there was frustration each time Maresca sought to make his complaints public rather than discussing internally first.He later admitted his comments after the Everton match were premeditated - rejecting the club's claim they were an emotional outburst after a tense match. After winning two trophies in his first two seasons, Maresca wanted to be seen as more than a project-focused manager, and believes the club stopped him raising his profile.The Italian wanted to take on some external engagements and had floated the idea of publishing a book but was blocked by the club - though this is a claim a source close to Maresca denies. He also spoke at Il Festival dello Sport - an event in Italy organised by La Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper - without their permission.He also made public that he disagreed with the club not signing a central defender after Levi Colwill injured his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season. The club's hierarchy explained that doing so could prompt academy prospect Josh Acheampong to request a transfer, which ultimately led Maresca to back down.Those close to Maresca, who has switched agents from the Wasserman agency to Jorge Mendes, made it known he was weighing up his future.The last week seemed to be the turning point in Maresca's mind, with Chelsea more keen to make any change of manager in the summer. The home supporters, who Maresca holds in high regard, booed his decisions to take off Cole Palmer in a defeat by Aston Villa and the draw with Bournemouth. Maresca was reportedly told by the medical department he needed to make that change, despite insisting in his news conference his star attacker could complete 90 minutes if he wanted to.All of this after a positive start...After Maresca's side beat Cardiff City in the Carabao Cup in December, supporters chanted his name.They hadn't done so as openly since appearing to be mounting an unlikely title challenge last season, when fans also sang 'We've got our Chelsea back'.But a disappointing run followed, and supporters turned on Maresca both inside the stadium and on social media.Part of the criticism was Maresca seemed a distant, project-focused manager, as fans struggled to move on from the very different and successful era under Roman Abramovich's stewardship.Though he won the Club World Cup, many supporters disliked his communication style and slow, patient football - and influential fans said chants in support of Maresca were largely a protest against the club's BlueCo ownership.That is why Chelsea continued efforts to convince supporters Maresca was the right manager and that the ownership's ultra long-term approach would eventually bring sustained success.Key figures at the club admired Maresca's style of play, insisting it improved players, and that any successor would adopt a similar approach. Further progress was made with team spirit after Mauricio Pochettino had laid the foundations.Regular starters broadly liked Maresca, but - perhaps inevitably - he was less popular on the fringes of the squad. There were complaints after one-off tactical missteps. One player questioned their man-to-man marking approach in a heavy defeat at Manchester City in January 2025, and Maresca said he needed to coach better after a home loss to Brighton, when Chelsea had a player sent off.The club's only real concern in his first season was that he had played down Chelsea's chances of Champions League qualification too much - alienating ambitious fans. There was also a curious moment at the Club World Cup when he awkwardly refused to praise Mexican set-piece coach Bernardo Cueva to a compatriot in the media, despite previously praising coaches closer to him.Maresca also adopted a cold, aggressive tone towards Chelsea's so-called 'bomb squad'. Initially, it proved useful - leaving unwanted players in no doubt they had to leave. But when players such as Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi failed to secure transfers, the approach became counterproductive, as the Blues have a legal obligation to look after the interests of all players on their books.Sources close to Maresca say he felt he deserved backing similar to that enjoyed by Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool and even Ruben Amorim during his struggles at Manchester United - including a say in shaping the project. Arteta, for example, has significant influence over Arsenal's transfer policy.But at Chelsea, the project is king - and the club are more comfortable seeing another manager slot in, rather than ceding any control.Can Chelsea move forward?Chelsea face a packed January schedule across four competitions.They begin with Sunday's Premier League trip to the Etihad, with a series of London derbies - home and away - against Fulham, Crystal Palace, Brentford and West Ham before the end of the month.In addition, they have an FA Cup third-round tie away to Charlton, a Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Arsenal, and two Champions League fixtures - at home to Pafos and away to Napoli.Chelsea realistically need to win both European games to avoid the play-off round and secure a top-eight finish in the league phase.The fifth place they occupy in the Premier League may be enough to secure a return to the Champions League for the 2026-27 season.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianandAlys DaviesGrowing unrest in Iran is reported to have claimed more lives on a fifth day of protests over the soaring cost of living.Both the semi-official Fars news agency and human rights group, Hengaw, said two people had died during clashes between protesters and security forces in the city of Lordegan, in south-western Iran. Three more people were killed in Azna and another in Kouhdasht, Fars reported, all in the west of the country.On Thursday videos posted on social media showed cars set on fire during running battles between protesters and security forces. Many protesters have called for ending the rule of the country's supreme leader. Some have also called for a return to the monarchy.As the day wore on more reports came in of unrest up and down the country, on the fifth day of the protests, sparked by a currency collapse.Videos verified by BBC Persian show protests in the central city of Lordegan, the capital Tehran and Marvdasht in the southern Fars province taking place on Thursday.Fars reported that in Lordegan two people were killed, citing an informed official. The report did not specify whether those killed were protesters or members of the security forces. It also reported the three deaths in Azna, in neighbouring Lorestan province, without specifying if there were protesters or security officials. Rights group Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday night in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province. The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoMost of Friday's papers lead with the fire at a Swiss ski resort bar which has killed dozens of people. \"Horror on the dancefloor\" is the headline for the Daily Star, which reports that British people are \"feared to be among the dead\" following the incident in Crans-Montana in south-west Switzerland.  More than 100 other people are injured, many of them critically, following the \"horror movie\" inferno at the New Year's Eve party in Le Constellation bar, the Daily Express reports. Witnesses tell the paper that the fire could have been started by candles or sparklers.The sparklers that caused the fire were attached to champagne bottles, according to the Sun's lead. Families face an \"unbearable wait\" of days for the bodies of victims to be identified. The fire is \"one of the worst tragedies\" that Switzerland has ever faced, according to the country's president. The i Paper reports that neighbouring countries are offering to \"lend support\" in treating patients, after local hospitals were overwhelmed with victims.The Daily Mail reports that the Foreign Office is on standby to assist any British nationals caught up in the tragedy, after Swiss officials confirmed international citizens were among the dead. Separately, the paper is one of several to feature a photo of the host of The Traitors, Claudia Winkelman, which returned to screens last night with a shake-up of the usual format.Switzerland will hold five days of mourning following the inferno, the Guardian reports, after the country's president vowed to ensure an incident of this kind never happens again. The King and Queen have offered their condolences to the victims of the fire, according to the Times, with the King also praising \"heroic first responders and selfless emergency services\". The paper notes that eight French nationals and sixteen Italian nationals are missing. \"New Year horror inferno\" is the headline for the Daily Mirror, which also features a photo of waitresses carrying champagne bottles with sparklers through Le Constellation bar. The Daily Telegraph front page features a photo of the moment the blaze began spreading across the ceiling of the bar's basement. It adds that the fire likely \"triggered the release of combustible gases that ignited violently\".Finally, the fire in Switzerland features on the front page of the Financial Times, but the paper leads on plans by three US tech giants to launch initial public offerings (IPOs) \"as early as this year\". IPO preparations for SpaceX, OpenAI and Anthropic are \"raising hopes of record returns for their investors and advisers\", the paper writes. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "12 hours agoSilvia CosteloeCrans-MontanaWatch: BBC reports from the scene of Swiss resort bar fireThere is sheer disbelief on people's faces here, confronted by this tragedy - they just can't believe it.I've been coming to Crans-Montana all my life, and this is a wonderful ski resort that just keeps getting bigger and bigger.There's a lot of building going on all the time. It's a place where there's a lot of money and a lot of great skiing. It's very family friendly and there are lots of children.In the summer they've got golf, in the winter they've got skiing, there are mountain bike trails. It's a really popular destination year round, quite a high-end market, and not the kind of place where you would expect a fire to engulf a bar.Le Constellation is somewhere I used to go to when I was much younger. It's a really classic bar.It's very big and right smack in the centre of Crans just by the cinema, and somewhere a lot of locals as well as tourists would be hanging out.This is a bar where lots of young people went. There will be people who are unsure if those they knew were out there, who are trying to trace them.Earlier today, I was speaking to a woman who asked: \"What is happening in the world if you can't go to a bar now in Crans-Montana?\" A British tourist told me he'd heard all these ambulances and just thought people had taken the drinking too far.LATEST UPDATES: Read more about the Swiss ski resort fire'I hid from a wall of heat': Eyewitnesses describe escapeWhat we know so far about how the fire broke outBut, of course, what it actually involved is this horrible tragedy.It's hard to imagine that something like that would happen here, in a place where there's money, very good levels of health and safety, great infrastructure and where police arrived at the scene pretty much immediately.ReutersPeople leave flowers outside Le ConstellationThis morning I woke up to go skiing, but when I saw what had happened I came to the scene instead.The cordoned off area is usually the beating heart of Crans. Initially it was incredibly quiet. I got there before they had erected this huge wall outside the bar. In the early hours of New Year's Day, people were sleeping off their hangovers and their partying, so the police presence gave the scene an almost eerie quality.Now more and more media tripods are going up. People started waking up - some had their skis on - and they all just came up against the cordon and asked what was going on. Some people had not heard yet.Increasingly however small huddles of people are talking about it. Some people have been sharing their stories of a really tragic and horrific night - how they saw people with severe burns, and how they escaped the burning bar by smashing a window.Others are looking in total disbelief at the police cordon in this very well-to-do Swiss Alpine resort. The size of the cordon, the amount of disruption and the number of closed roads all indicate a major disaster.It's just completely shocking.",

    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said on Thursday he was open to talks with the US on drug trafficking and oil, after weeks of an escalating pressure campaign against his government.In an interview with Venezuelan state TV, Maduro said he was ready for dialogue with the US \"wherever they want and whenever they want\". He also evaded a question about President Donald Trump saying the US had attacked a docking facility in Venezuela, which was reportedly carried out by the CIA. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. It comes as US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" , with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.The latest attack came on Wednesday when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.On Monday, Trump said the US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.The US has also been cracking down on sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".",

    "body": "Amber severe weather warnings for snow and several yellow warnings for snow and ice have been issued by the Met Office for areas around the UK on Friday.While the most severe conditions will be seen in Scotland, all of the UK's nations will be affected with travel disruption expected. With lower temperatures, amber cold health alerts from the UK's Health Security Agency (UKHSA) cover the whole of England.The amber warning for snow comes into effect for parts of Scotland at midday on Friday and could result in vehicles being stranded, rural communities being cut off, and rail and air cancellations. Areas affected by the warning include Angus, Perth and Kinross, Grampian, Aberdeenshire, Moray and parts of the Highlands.Snow showers will become more frequent during the day. Accumulations of 10-20cm are likely at low levels with 30-40cm possible on high ground with some drifting and blizzards.The Met Office has urged people to plan routes carefully and to pack essentials in your car in the event of delays. Key items to bring include warm clothing, water, a blanket and ice-scraper.The amber warnings in Scotland are currently due to be in effect until midday on Saturday.Ch Supt Scott McCarren, Police Scotland's head of road policing, said: \"Our advice is to plan ahead and consider if your journey is really necessary during the bad weather or if it can be delayed until conditions improve.\"Yellow warnings for snow and ice came into force for large parts of England, Northern Ireland and Wales at midnight on Thursday, remaining until midday on Friday in England and Wales, and 10:00 GMT in Northern Ireland.  As much as 5cm of snow is possible in a few areas, including the higher ground of north Wales, north-west England and the north-west Midlands, the Met Office added.Amber cold health alerts from the UKHSA for the whole of England will be in place until 12:00 on 6 January.The alerts warn of a rise in deaths particularly among elderly and vulnerable people.Other consequences of cold weather include temperatures inside hospitals and care homes dropping below the levels recommended for assessing health risks, and challenges for people keeping indoor temperatures at the recommended 18C, according to the UKHSA.Stay up to date with the latest forecast on the BBC Weather website or app as details are likely to change.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMayeni JonesAfrica correspondent, JohannesburgChristian Parkinson / BBCArnold Ncube was unable to complete his education because he could not prove he was South AfricanMany people may take their birth certificate, or similar official papers, for granted - hidden in a drawer and rarely seeing the light of day - but for those without one, it can lead to a shadow life or an uncertain existence.This is thought to affect millions of people around the world, described as stateless, and 25-year-old South African Arnold Ncube is one of those.Because he has no state-issued documents, washing cars in the backstreets of Thembisa township near Johannesburg is one of the few ways he can make a living.He was born in Johannesburg and his father is South African, qualifying him for citizenship here. But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.Ed Habershon / BBCChristy Chitengu only found out at 17 that she was statelessHuman rights lawyer and advocate Christy Chitengu used to be stateless herself.She only got South African citizenship three years ago with the help of the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights who worked on her case for free.\"I found out I was stateless at the age of 17. My high school principal called me into her office and told me that she didn't have any documents for me and that she didn't understand how I'd gotten into the school,\" she tells the BBC near her home in northern Johannesburg.\"I was born in Johannesburg to two foreign parents [both from Zimbabwe] and at my birth I was given a handwritten South African birth certificate.\"But officials in South Africa need a printed certificate.Christy says that when she found out she was stateless she looked into taking her parents' nationality but it was too late.\"I couldn't claim my Zimbabwean citizenship because by that time I was 16 and they wouldn't allow me to do a late birth registration. Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"Getty ImagesIn South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting. So we think that it's important that as a matter of inclusion, all issues of statelessness are addressed so that all these people on the margins of society can contribute fully to society and the economy.\"Back in Thembisa, Arnold is playing football with local children.After years of struggle, he now has a lawyer helping him fight for the papers that prove he belongs here. He wants to go back to school to study computer science. He hopes having documents will lead to a brighter future.Additional reporting by Christian ParkinsonMore from South Africa:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "10 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterEastEnders and James Bond actor Colin Salmon has said he is \"genuinely grateful\" for the \"compassion\" he was shown by a court after he avoided a driving ban for speeding.The actor plays George Knight in the BBC One soap and also appeared in three Bond films from the Pierce Brosnan era - Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.Salmon already had nine points on his licence and received three more for travelling at 24mph in a 20mph zone in London last March.That would usually trigger an automatic six-month disqualification from driving, but Salmon avoided a ban, partly because he cares for his seriously ill wife and daughter and drives them to medical appointments. Writing on X on Thursday, Salmon apologised and said he appreciated the understanding shown for his \"extraordinary circumstances\".\"I hold my hands up, take full responsibility & apologise,\" he wrote. \"I actually feel the 20mph limit has improved quality of life in London.\"Nine points in seven weeks within half a mile of my front door. Proves the maxim 'you're more likely to have an accident five mins from home!'\"The court weighed up our extraordinary circumstances, fined me but showed compassion for which I'm genuinely grateful.\"He added: \"Here's to a less eventful and healthy 2026.\"Salmon, 64, appeared at Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court in south-west London earlier this week.He pleaded guilty to driving his Suzuki Wagon in excess of the 20mph limit in  Acton, near his Shepherds Bush home, on 31 March last year.The actor already had nine points for speeding in April 2023, running a red light in February 2025, and driving without due care and attention in April 2025.On Tuesday, Salmon was fined £666, with £130 costs, ordered to pay a £266 victim surcharge and received three more penalty points, but avoided a driving ban.Salmon is married to artist and illustrator Fiona Hawthorne, who previously revealed she was diagnosed with a rare lung condition, interstitial lung disease, which requires her to use an oxygen tank. She underwent a lung transplant in the US in 2024.The couple's daughter Sasha also fell ill with lymphoma, a cancer that affects the blood cells, in 2019.They also have a high-functioning autistic son, and Salmon himself underwent hip replacement surgery last year.Bench chairman Mark Stollery told him: \"We note you are the main breadwinner and carer for your family and within the family, members have life-limiting conditions, including your wife and children.\"The magistrate noted Salmon and his family would suffer \"exceptional hardship\" if he was disqualified, adding: \"They rely on you abnormally compared to most families and we also note your charitable work and that takes up time and travel.\"Salmon previously said he took the role in EastEnders in 2022 as he \"can't be far from home\" because his wife is \"not well\".His character in the soap, ex-boxer George Knight, is the patriarch of the Knight family and a former co-owner of the Queen Vic pub.In James Bond, Salmon played MI6 deputy chief of staff Charles Robinson, and was often featured in scenes along side Dame Judi Dench's M.Salmon's other screen credits include Death In Paradise, Silent Witness, Band of Gold, Judge John Deed, Bad Girls, Doctor Who, Spooks and Midsomer Murders.",

    "body": "1 hour agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterChina's BYD is set to overtake Elon Musk's Tesla as the world's biggest seller of  electric vehicles (EVs), marking the first time it has outpaced its American rival for annual sales.On Thursday, BYD said that sales of its battery-powered cars rose last year by almost 28% to more than 2.25 million.Tesla, which is due to reveal its total sales for 2025 later on Friday, last week published analyst's estimates suggesting that it had sold around 1.65 million vehicles for the year as a whole.The US firm has faced a tough year with a mixed reception to new offerings, unease over Musk's political activities and intensifying competition from Chinese rivals.In October, Tesla introduced lower-priced versions of its two best-selling models in the US in a bid to boost sales. It had faced criticism that it had been slow to release new and more affordable options to stay competitive.Musk, who is already the world's richest man, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package. The deal, which was approved by shareholders in November, could see him getting a payout of as much as $1tn (£740bn).As part of the agreement, Musk also has to sell a million humanoid robots over the next ten years. Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".Tesla sales slumped in the first three months of 2025 after a backlash against Musk's role in US President Donald Trump's administration.Besides Tesla, the multi-billionaire's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.Those commitments, along with running Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.Since then Musk has pledged to \"significantly\" cut back his role in the US government.Despite BYD's rapid expansion in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years.The Shenzhen-based firm faces mounting competition in China, its key market, from a surge of EV makers like XPeng and Nio.Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.The company's rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.In October, BYD said the UK had become its biggest market outside China. The firm said that its sales in Britain surged by 880% in the year to the end of September, driven by strong demand for the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U sports utility vehicle (SUV).",

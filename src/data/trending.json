    "body": "4 hours agoThe loss of Andrew's titles continues to dominate the papers on Saturday morning, with the Mirror declaring that King Charles III had \"listened to the people\". The paper reports that the King made the decision to strip his brother of his titles after he was heckled over Andrew's links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is under \"mounting pressure\" from his own MPs to remove Andrew from the royal line of succession, according to the Telegraph. The paper has spoken to Labour MP Jon Trickett and independent MP Rachel Maskell, who said that removing Andrew from his current position of eighth in line to the throne would be \"appropriate\". Monty Python star Terry Jones is pictured on the Telegraph's front page, after the release of a new biography that details the late comedian's \"unexpected\" life and the \"tragic descent\" into dementia during his final years. \"Andrew quit fight after losing loyalty of ex-wife\" proclaims the Times, reporting that the former Duke and Duchess of York will \"finally separate nearly 30 years after their divorce\". The paper says that after moving out of the Royal Lodge, Andrew will relocate to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, while his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson will \"make her own plans\".The Guardian writes that Andrew is in line for a \"significant\" six-figure sum to cover his relocation to Sandringham, in addition to a yearly stipend from the King. The paper says that the annual payments would be paid from the King's private funds, and alleges that the sum would be \"several times his £20,000 annual navy pension\".The i Weekend has also led on the cost of Andrew's relocation to Sandringham, and alleges that the former Duke of York is set to receive £558k. However, Buckingham Palace told the paper that \"remedial works could affect any compensation due\", and the i reports that repair costs for the Royal Lodge are currently estimated at £1m. \"Need a man and van Andy?\" asks the Star, offering to assist Andrew in moving out of the Royal Lodge.\"We can't bear him either\" says the Sun, writing that residents in Sandringham are none too keen to see the beleaguered Andrew make the move to Norfolk.  \"William and Kate pushed for Andrew to be ousted\" reads the headline of the Daily Mail, amid \"unrivalled Royal coverage\" in the paper's Saturday edition. It says that the Prince and Princess of Wales believed a \"clean break from Andrew was the only way the Royal Family can move forward\". One of the few papers not leading on the Royal family, the Financial Times has turned their focus to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget in its weekend edition. The paper reports that new council tax bands are likely, and says the move could raise \"several billion pounds for the exchequer\". The Express has led with claims from the mother of Royal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck, who said that the army is \"not safe for young women\" just hours after an ex-Army sergeant major was jailed for six months for sexually assaulting her daughter. Warrant Officer Michael Webber, 43, pinned down the 19-year-old soldier and tried to kiss her in July 2021. She was found dead five months later in her barracks at Larkhill, Wiltshire. An inquest into her death found the Army's handling of the complaint played \"more than a minimal contributory part in her death\".Related Internet Links",

    "body": "16 hours agoKaty Austin,transport correspondent and Emer Moreau,business reporterA proposed plan to trial free bus passes for under-22s in England will not go ahead as it is \"unaffordable\" at the moment, the government has said.The trial was one of a number of recommendations put forward by the Transport Committee, a cross-party group of backbench MPs, in a report this August - with the suggestion it would boost access to jobs and education. In its response, published on Friday, the government said no money was available for such a scheme during the current spending review period, which runs until 2028/2029. Responding to the government's decision, committee chair Ruth Cadbury accused the Department for Transport of \"lacking in ambition\".\"Throughout our inquiry we heard about the consequences of poor connectivity,\" Labour MP Cadbury said. \"Young people unable to get their first jobs or taking exhausting journeys to reach school or college. Older and disabled people feeling isolated and depressed, and high streets starved of customers.\"\"It is hard to shake the feeling that an opportunity may be missed, particularly to improve services in rural and underserved communities.\"  Since January 2022, everyone in Scotland aged between five and 22 has been entitled to free bus travel.Gracie Moore is 22 and lives in Slough. She spends £120 a month to get the bus to and from work every day.Gracie said the government's decision was \"disappointing\".\"It would have been so beneficial, considering that under 22s are so negatively impacted by inflation,\" she said. \"Things like buying our first house or affording bills are already difficult, so this would have taken the pressure off for us.\"Gracie previously lived in Madrid, where she enjoyed unlimited travel on bus, train, tube, and tram for only €8 (£6.90) a month with a young person's travel card.England, she said, \"seem[s] to be one of the only countries who cannot effectively subsidise travel costs\".The announcement of the government's plans on under-22 bus travel in England comes in the week when the Bus Services Act has become law. Welcomed by the committee, it will place tougher requirements on operators that wish to cancel certain services and give local authorities more control, including through franchising. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the new law would make it \"easier for local leaders to take control of their buses\" and was \"putting passengers first\". Cadbury said while the new law is \"positive and necessary\" it cannot be \"the last word\". Of the other recommendations put forward by the committee, some were received positively. These included a suggestion that funding should be laid out over a longer period, and should be weighted to take account of rural needs. However, along with free travel for under-22s, other points of action were rejected - including a call for minimum service levels for buses. The government argued that \"significant differences in demographics, need and geography\" would make minimum levels of service \"very challenging to implement at a national level, whilst also ensuring value for money\".The number of bus journeys taken in England has dropped in recent years, while fares have risen faster than inflation.The committee found that this was a barrier to opportunity and growth in some areas.Bus passengers spend £39.1bn in local businesses every year, according to research from KPMG.But experts told the Transport Committee that the bus sector's contribution to the economy declined by around £8.9bn between 2011 and 2023.The committee's report said: \"The current deregulated nature of the bus sector can encourage commercial operators to \"deprioritise\" less profitable routes, often leaving vulnerable communities without a service.\"",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorPierre Crom/Getty ImagesRob Jetten, 38, is now tipped to become the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch historyCentrist liberal leader Rob Jetten has claimed victory in Wednesday's nail-biting Dutch election, after vote analysis indicated his party could not be beaten by anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders.Jetten's D66 party currently has a narrow lead of 15,000 votes over Wilders' Freedom Party, and Dutch news agency ANP says even though the vote count is not complete, Wilders can no longer win.\"We are the biggest party in the Netherlands! Now we'll get to work for all Dutch people,\" Jetten posted on X. Wilders said it was the electoral council not a news agency that decided the result: \"What arrogance not to wait for that.\"Projections from about 99% of the vote put both parties on 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament - but ANP says Jetten's centrists could win a 27th seat.Jetten, 38, told reporters he was \"very proud of this historic result\" and now felt a great responsibility to form a stable and ambitious government.Wilders had led opinion polls going into Wednesday's election, but Rob Jetten succeeded in winning in some of the main Dutch cities including Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht with a positive campaign using a catchphrase of \"Yes, we can\". No Dutch election race has ever been so close, and if Jetten does become prime minister he will be the youngest in Dutch history.Until now Jetten was careful not to declare victory until all votes were in, but ANP said based on figures from postal voters abroad he could now be declared the winner.Wilders said even if D66 did go on to become the biggest party, his Freedom Party (PVV) would \"not let the Netherlands be broken up by Jetten and his people\".Jetten told reporters that his party had \"shown to the rest of Europe and the world that it is possible to beat the populist movements if you campaign with a positive message\".The Dutch electoral system is based on proportional representation in one nationwide constituency, so whichever party secures most votes wins most seats. Jetten's liberals have so far won 16.9% of the vote, while Wilders' Freedom Party is on 16.7%. As results came in on Thursday, the race was so close that the lead flipped between the two parties.In a sign that he was not ready to concede victory, Wilders dubbed the Dutch news agency \"ANP66\" and shared unfounded claims from social media of vote-rigging. One local authority, in Zaanstad outside Amsterdam, rejected the allegation as \"fabricated\".Although the D66 leader's path to forming a coalition is not straightforward, Jetten has said he wants to make a quick start.Jetten said after the vote that never before had a party won a Dutch election with fewer than 30 seats. He will need the support of at least three other parties to gather the 76 seats needed to form a coalition. The most obvious candidates would be the conservative-liberal VVD, the left-wing Labour (PvdA)-GreenLeft alliance and the Christian Democrats, but it could take months if that is to happen.VVD leader Dilan Yesilgöz has so far ruled out working with the left, but Jetten said he favoured a broad-based government from the centre of Dutch politics.The weekend would be a good chance for all the parties to reflect, before a \"scout\" is given the task next Tuesday of sounding them out. Jetten said he wanted to construct a coalition that represented best the millions of voters who had backed other parties to tackle the main issues, including the housing shortage and asylum and migration.His path to victory has stunned observers. Less than two years ago he led D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - to fifth place and just nine seats. Only a few weeks ago they were still languishing in the opinion polls, but gradually improved as Jetten put in several polished performances in TV debates and even  competed in the final of a TV quiz show 11 days before the election.Outgoing Prime Minister Dick Schoof predicted on Friday that Jetten's task of forming a coalition would prove complicated. \"I reckon I'll still be prime minister at Christmas - I'd be surprised if it happened [by then]\".Schoof, a former chief of Dutch intelligence, was picked for the top job by Geert Wilders, who abandoned his bid to lead the country last year because his prospective coalition partners would not support having a far-right prime minister.Wilders won the last election in November 2023, and a government was only formed in July 2024. Eleven months later, he brought his own government down, in a row with his coalition partners over asylum and migration policy.",

    "body": "13 hours agoEthan GudgeSouth of EnglandA second solid gold toilet is to be auctioned off, after the first casting was stolen from Blenheim Palace in 2019.America, created by Italian conceptual artist Maurizio Cattelan, is a fully functional toilet, fashioned from more than 15st 13lb (101.2kg) of solid 18-carat gold.The first version of the work was initially installed in a public bathroom at the  Guggenheim museum in New York in 2016 but hit the news again three years later when a gang of thieves stole it from Blenheim in Oxfordshire. Now the existence of a second golden toilet has been revealed, which is due to go under the hammer at Sotheby's in New York City on 18 November.It is estimated more than 100,000 people used the first toilet while it was at the Guggenheim before it was moved and exhibited at Blenheim Palace.It was there that in the early hours of 14 September 2019, five men smashed their way in, ripped out the £4.8m solid gold installation and fled in a stolen Volkswagen Golf.The heist and the trial that followed made news across the world.    James Sheen, 40, from Oxford, pleaded guilty to burglary and transferring criminal property in 2024. Michael Jones, 39, from Oxford, was found guilty of burglary in March. Both were both jailed earlier this year.Fred Doe, 36, from Windsor, was also convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property and given a suspended sentence.Sotheby's has revealed that Cattelan created three toilets in 2016, with work number two now up for sale.The second version will be on display in a bathroom at New York's Breuer Building until it goes under the hammer.The auction house described it as a \"cultural phenomenon\" and an \"incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value\".David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's New York, said: \"America is Maurizio Cattelan's tour de force.\"\"Holding both a proverbial and literal mirror to the art world, the work confronts the most uncomfortable questions about art, and the belief systems held sacred to the institutions of the market and the museum,\" Mr Galperin explained.The auction house said that in a world first, the starting bid on the artwork would be determined by the exact price of its weight in gold when the sale begins.That means, if sold at today's rate, bidding on the solid gold toilet would begin at around $10m (£7.6m).",

    "body": "11 hours agoBen Hatton & Maia DaviesGetty Images, York Cottage, Alamy, Oliver's TravelsAnmer Hall, York Cottage, Park House and Gardens House are all on the estate - but not all of them are available Newly stripped of his \"prince\" title, Andrew is moving from his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, to the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, it is understood.Formal notice was given to surrender the lease at the Royal Lodge on Thursday, and the move will take place as soon as possible.The historic, sprawling estate spans approximately 31 sq miles (80 sq km) of gardens - making it around the same size as Nottingham or Brighton and Hove.It was bought as a private country retreat for the future Edward VII when he was Albert, Prince of Wales in 1862, and has since been passed down from monarch to monarch.The estate itself covers several residential villages and hamlets, and includes 15 sq miles (40 sq km) of farmland.The main building - Sandringham House - is thought to have more than a hundred rooms, including a ballroom.It remains a country retreat for the Royal Family and is where they traditionally gather at Christmas.Andrew will be moving some 140 miles (225km) north-east of his Windsor mansion - and away from senior royals like King Charles III and Queen Camilla, who reside in London, and the Prince and Princess of Wales in Windsor.Some assumed Andrew would move from Royal Lodge to another property on the Windsor estate, Frogmore Cottage for example, royal biographer Robert Hardman told the BBC.\"But no,\" he said, \"he's off the estate, he's out of Windsor, he's out of royal Berkshire - he's been sent up the M11 to the royal equivalent of Siberia to sit in Sandringham for the rest of his life.\"\"This is - some might say brutal, others might say definitive.\"Sandringham is a private estate - not an official royal residence - and it is understood the King will be privately funding Andrew's accommodation there, and that it will not be directly funded by the taxpayer.The Palace has not yet said exactly where on the estate Andrew will live, or when he could move.But royal sources have said it will not be immediate, and instead be \"as soon as possible and practicable\". Here is a look at some of the options on the estate.York CottageAlamyOriginally known as Bachelor's Cottage, York Cottage is about a quarter of a mile from the main house.It has its own set of stables and kennel buildings, according to Historic England, and overlooks one of two man-made lakes on the estate.There were reports ahead of Prince Harry's marriage to the Duchess of Sussex that the pair might have been gifted the use of York Cottage by Elizabeth II for use as a country home, but no such plan was ever confirmed and the move never materialised.It has reportedly been used as an office and accommodation for staff in recent years.Follow live updates on this storyEverything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proudWhere does the King get his money?Park HouseBrendan Beirne/ShutterstockThe birthplace of Diana, Princess of Wales and her childhood home, Park House was rented by the Spencer family for many years.In 1983 it was gifted to Leonard Cheshire, a disability charity, which used it to run a 16-bedroom hotel for the disabled, their carers and family.The charity planned a £2.3m refurbishment before the pandemic hit, but announced in 2020 it would not go ahead with the proposal and said instead that it was working with the Sandringham estate to exit the lease.Gardens HouseOliver's TravelsGardens House was put on the market as a holiday let over the summerAnother option is the Gardens House, which was once the residence of the head gardener on the Sandringham estate.The Edwardian house has six bedrooms and three bathrooms, is dog-friendly and is one of two properties on the estate available to the general public as a holiday let.Its grounds hold a working sawmill and organic farm.It was put on the market in July at a weekly price of £4,110. It is not unusual for royal residences to rent out property to holidaymakers - with eight cottages and lodges available for hire at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.The FollyAnother possibility is The Folly - a three-bedroom, two-bathroom lodge built in the 1800s.Complete with a turret and a wraparound balcony, it has been used as a hunting lodge and a place to take afternoon tea.Also listed as a holiday let to the public, it is said to have room for six guests - a change from the 30-room Windsor mansion Andrew will be vacating.Given the lodge's \"grandeur\", Majesty Magazine's managing editor Joe Little told the BBC earlier this year, there is a \"a heightened awareness that the privately owned royal estates are actively striving to bolster\" the Royal Family's revenue streams.Wood FarmShutterstockThis is one option that is understood to have been ruled out.The farmhouse, described as \"small and intimate\" by former housekeeper Teresa Thompson, has strong associations with Andrew's parents.His father, the late Duke of Edinburgh, chose the secluded property as his permanent home when he retired from public life in 2017.He and the late Queen already regularly stayed there in preference to opening up Sandringham House when it was just the two of them.Anmer HallGetty ImagesAnmer Hall was gifted to the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales as a wedding present by the late queen in 2013 - so this may be an unlikely choice.They spend much of the school holidays in the 10-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house, which is about 2 miles (3km) east of the main Sandringham house.The Georgian property dates back to about 1802, but some parts are much older - and it has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentElla MurrayElla (left) with flatmate Maisy, says socialising is often done at the kitchen tableHomes without lounges are becoming a reality for renters on tight budgets faced with a lack of available lets.Nearly a third of homes advertised on flat-sharing website SpareRoom in the first half of the year had no living room.Ella Murray, aged 22, who shares with three other people in London, said: \"At this stage in my life I'm not willing to sacrifice money for more space.\"Landlords say turning a lounge into a bedroom helps them cover their higher mortgages and other extra costs, while meeting demand from tenants.But a lack of communal space means many renters are living and working in one bedroom putting them at risk of social isolation.Some also point out the \"false economy\" of being forced to go out to socialise which can cost more than a night in with friends.Cost-of-living pressuresStudents living away from home might expect to rent in a property where the front room has been converted into a bedroom.But these latest figures suggest this is a reality for young professionals renting in their 20s and 30s.Analysis by SpareRoom, shared with the BBC, shows:Some 30% of adverts for a room posted on the platform in the first half of the year were for places without a living roomThat proportion was higher in London, at 41%Birmingham saw an increase from 16% to 22% of adverts with no living room in the five years from 2020The data covers flat or house shares only, and does not include any studio, or one-bedroom listings.Official figures show average UK monthly private rents increased by 5.5%, to £1,354, in the year to September.As costs rise, there are 10 prospective tenants on average chasing every available rental property, according to the latest Rightmove data.A landlord turning a lounge into a bedroom provides an extra place for a tenant. It could also mean lower rent payments for each tenant but potentially more rent overall for landlords covering higher mortgage repayments seen in recent years.Ella and her three housemates split the rent of £3,000 a month dependant on the size of their bedrooms, but their home does not have a living room.\"We have a decent-sized kitchen with a dining table which is where we hang out instead. We would definitely socialise more if we had a living room,\" she said.She said the rent was cheaper as a result, and - living in London - it was the norm among her friends in other rental properties in the city.She works in musical theatre, and said she would be more inclined to rent somewhere with a living room were her wage to increase and were she to move in with a partner.Hannah CarneyHannah and her flatmate Emma usually socialise in the kitchenHannah Carney, 26, also shares a property without a lounge and says none of the places she had rented since she was 18 had a living room.She says she misses having a \"chill place that is social\" and it means she and her flatmates probably spend more on going out for dinner and drinks.\"I'd love to say that all properties should have a communal area. I wish that was the norm, but I know it's not realistic,\" she said.The best she and her flatmate could do, she says, is to have movie nights in a box room that they also use to hang their washing.Matt Hutchinson, director of SpareRoom said: \"We've had so many messages from people who met their best friends and partners in flatshares, who've raised families or started businesses together.\"Those kinds of stories will become rarer if communal, sociable spaces within homes are not protected. Sadly, loneliness is alarmingly common.\"With rents as unaffordable as they are now, it's understandable people are looking for ways to cut the cost of living.\"Chris Norris, chief policy officer at the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) said the \"root of the challenges\" was too few rental homes to meet demand.The NRLA said some landlords, facing a difficult outlook, were moving into offering multi-occupancy homes so their businesses remained viable enough to carry on.\"With rising costs and the expectation of smaller margins to contend with, some landlords will certainly be looking at how to use their investments most efficiently and meet demand effectively whilst delivering high-quality private rented homes,\" Mr Norris said.At the more extreme end of the scale, the BBC has previously uncovered illegal house-sharing in multi-occupancy homes.",

    "body": "11 hours agoMayeni Jones,Africa correspondent, Bernd Debusmann Jr,at the White House and Natasha BootyThe South African government has criticised the US's decision to prioritise refugee applications from white Afrikaners, saying claims of a white genocide have been widely discredited and lack reliable evidence.It highlighted an open letter published by prominent members of the Afrikaner community earlier this week rejecting the narrative, with some signatories calling the relocation scheme racist.The limited number of white South African Afrikaners signing up to relocate to the US was indication that they were not being persecuted, it added.On Thursday, the administration of US President Donald Trump announced its lowest refugee annual cap on record - to just 7,500.The exact figures of the number of white South Africans who have been admitted through the US scheme are not available. South Africa's latest crime statistics do not indicate that more white people have fallen victim to violent crime than other racial groups. Earlier this year President Trump offered refugee status to Afrikaners - who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers - after South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law allowing the government to seize land without compensation in rare instances. Is there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Unpacking the South African land law that so inflames TrumpOn the road incorrectly identified as a 'burial site' by TrumpMost private farmland is owned by white South Africans who make up just over 7% of the population.Several months ago, South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".President Trump held up a photo purporting to show body bags containing the remains of white people in South Africa, but the Reuters news agency later identified the photo as one of their own - taken thousands of miles away in the war-struck Democratic Republic of Congo.Washington did not comment on the claim that they had misidentified the image.The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAlex LoftusLondonSimone Joyner/Getty ImagesBoy Better Know performing at this year's Wireless Festival In 2005, brothers Joseph and Jamie Adenuga were facing uncertainty in the wake of their rap crew disbanding. While other members started to re-organise themselves, the Tottenham-based siblings decided to pursue music on their own terms - a move that would come to define their careers. The brothers are now better known as Skepta and JME, and the label they formed was Boy Better Know (BBK). \"They were so influential for rapping in the UK, they showed us we can,\" Lewisham-based artist Shaybo tells the BBC. At this time, grime was still a young and developing genre of music that was emerging out of the electronic dance scene.Up-and-coming British rappers were being signed to major labels to make what the industry considered to be more commercially viable songs. In other words - not grime. But the ethos of BBK was to stay independent and stay true to who you are. \"They are incredibly headstrong people and probably saw the pitfalls of signing deals,\" says RWD magazine founder Dacre Bracey, who has covered grime since its inception.There are other members of the label - such as Frisco, Jammer and Shorty - but \"the genius of BBK is the Adenuga family,\" he explains. Tristan Fewings/Getty ImagesJME (far left) and Skepta (third from right) are the \"genius\" of BBK, says Dacre BraceyAn early sign of this genius was their T-shirts printed with the Boy Better Know logo. Designed by JME - who would go on to graduate from the University of Greenwich with a degree in 3D digital design - they were sold all over the capital and helped fund the label in the early days, says Bracey. \"Everyone would wear their T-shirts at school,\" Shaybo adds. \"BBK gave you the confidence to be unapologetically yourself. I could listen to music I really related to.\"Another artist who felt the influence while still a teenager was rapper Capo Lee. He attended Winchmore School in north London, the same as the Adenuga brothers, although is a few years younger. \"When you're drowning in negativity it's hard to get out of it,\" he tells the BBC. \"They gave us a lot of hope that things were possible.\"I started as a DJ in secondary school, when I was 13. My friends would come round and we'd try to recreate their vibe in my room.\"John Rahim/ ShutterstockSkepta (pictured) and JME attended Winchmore School in north LondonThings were really starting to grow for the label in the late 2000s.They'd released dozens of well-received mixtapes, culminating in the track Too Many Man, which broke into the UK singles charts. But by 2010, the world of grime looked very different. \"The excitement had petered out,\" Bracey says. \"The police really drew down on the live event aspect of grime so you couldn't perform, and the [government] cracked down on pirate radio.\"A lot of people retired and moved on, or changed genres.\"Dizzee Rascal, who once defined the sound of grime with his Mercury Prize-winning debut Boy in da Corner, now made more commercial rap, with songs like Bonkers and Dance Wiv Me. But Capo Lee still sees this commercial breakthrough as a positive for grime. \"Music was very different in the 2010s, but [the public] got used to seeing black men on the screen,\" he says.Dave M. Benett/Getty ImagesJME has remained proudly independent throughout his careerEven through this quiet period for grime, BBK continued to release music. \"JME has always had this very strong spirit of independence, he's never been seduced by the trappings of fame,\" says documentary photographer Simon Wheatley, who has known the Adenuga brothers for many years.Skepta temporarily altered course, signing to Universal where he released his third album Doin' It Again to modest commercial success. But his sound was watered down and he left the label, returning to grime with the 2014 hit That's Not Me, a song about rejecting commercial pressure and designer brands to be true to yourself. The music video, which cost £80 to create, scooped a Mobo award - proving Skepta could make it just fine on his own. Tim P. Whitby/Getty ImagesSkepta won the Mercury Prize for his 2016 album Konnichiwa JME's output culminated in his hugely successful 2015 album Integrity, which entered the UK albums chart at number 12. \"I think it's a very aptly named album given the way he is,\" Wheatley says. The following year Skepta released his own magnum opus, Konnichiwa. With a sprinkling of Pharrell Williams' production over its undeniable grime core, the album was awarded the Mercury Prize. Released by BBK, it helped cement grime as a genre being driven on its own terms, away from the influence of major label executives.  It was this period of the label that \"opened everyone's eyes and ears again\" to grime, Capo Lee tells the BBC. WireImage via Getty ImagesShaybo says BBK gave her the confidence to be unapologetically herselfOther artists would follow - Stormzy, Dave, Bugzy Malone - and take the genre in different directions, but they all began on the independent path forged by BBK. Even an artist like Shaybo, who would not describe herself as a grime MC, says BBK has had a huge impact on her.\"Grime was my foundation, they gave me the skills to rap and the confidence to embrace my heritage,\" the 29-year-old says. \"When people hear BBK they know it's BBK.\"\"These things could only have happened in London or the UK, through the melting pot of cultures,\" Bracey adds.\"That's why BBK are great and magical and special.\"Additional reporting by Connie BowkerMore on this story",

    "body": "A British canoeist has been banned for two years for posting \"explicit\" footage of himself on social media.A disciplinary panel found that Kurts Adams Rozentals brought the sport into \"serious disrepute\" when he uploaded a video of him performing what it called a \"sexual act\" on an aeroplane to his public Instagram account in March, and that this amounted to gross misconduct.As well as being banned from all competition and training, he has also been deselected from the World Class Programme - UK Sport's lottery-funded initiative to help athletes at the 2028 and 2032 Olympics - by Paddle UK.Rozentals, 23, told BBC Sport he felt the punishment was \"very extreme\" and does not regret the video.\"This ban would have never happened if athletes were funded properly,\" he said.\"And while I understand the video could be described as crazy, it was not illegal and certainly shouldn't be the reason for banning an athlete.\"Rozentals said his most recent funding from Paddle UK was £16,000 per year.But he claimed he had earned more than £100,000 from his social media videos between January and May.Paddle UK said the decision was made by a disciplinary panel, following an independent investigation and hearing involving Rozentals.The governing body said Rozentals had \"admitted posting an explicit video on their public Instagram profile which was subsequently removed given its explicit nature\".It said this was a breach of its disciplinary policy relating to \"indecent, offensive or immoral behaviour\" and \"offensive use of social media\".Rozentals had previously told media he did not know the reason for his suspension but suspected it was linked to his account on the subscription website OnlyFans, which is known for hosting adult content.The panel found Rozentals had \"intentionally misinformed the press\" in this regard.Asked if he regretted the video, Rozentals told BBC Sport: \"Looking back now, I probably wouldn't post something like that. But I remember the state of mind I was in when I did film it and post it. It was the first time in my life I saw real progress in my financial situation. It was the first time I was able to fund the training myself.\"It was the first time I was able to get my mum something nice after her sacrificing everything in order to allow me to chase my dream. And it came from crazy videos like the one that got me banned.\"I saw a direct correlation of me making those type of videos and my life situation improving. So, I was in this state of mind where I knew that all I have to do to continue this, is keep making videos like this. It's a crazy world we live in. I don't regret it.\"In a statement, Paddle UK said it is \"committed to ensuring a safe and open environment for all, and action under the athlete disciplinary policy is taken where necessary and proportionate\".",

    "body": "'I was accused of spying and beaten' - a boy's escape from captured Sudan city3 hours agoBushra Mohamed and Akisa Wandera,BBC AfricaAFP via Getty ImagesPeople are arriving in Tawila after having travelled on foot for three daysTwelve-year-old Abdiwahab - not his real name - sobs as he recounts what happened to him as he escaped from the western Sudanese city of el-Fasher.The young boy left el-Fasher on Sunday as it fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the paramilitary group that has been fighting a two-and-a-half-year civil war against the army.In a video received by the BBC, his face reflects deep sorrow and fatigue, his voice low as he describes being assaulted \"many times\" by RSF fighters. Fearing reprisal attacks from RSF fighters, Abdiwahab had joined a wave of people - including some of his family - trying to get out.The UN estimates that 60,000 have managed to get out of el-Fasher with many narrating horrendous stories of atrocities, including rape.'We saw people murdered in front of us' - siege survivors speak to the BBCNew videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanAfter three days of walking Abdiwahab reached the relative safety of Tawila - an 80km (50-mile) journey - but he arrived on his own.''I left the city with my father and siblings but because of the chaos we were separated, I came to Tawila alone,\" he says on the video.He was assaulted on the way and accused of being involved in espionage.\"I walked along the road, and on the road, [the RSF] caught me, many times. They beat me and hit me, saying, 'this little boy is a spy'.\"This chimes with other accounts of how men and boys are especially at risk as they face arbitrary arrest, violence and summary execution.Abdiwahab says that RSF fighters had already taken his mother and one of his sisters about a month ago, and he does not know if they are still alive.Ali, not his real name, who is now a volunteer aid worker after fleeing el-Fasher himself a fortnight ago, was the one who filmed Abdiwahab's account.He is stationed at the entrance to Tawila where a temporary camp has been established and where new arrivals gather before being relocated to permanent camps inside the town.In a voice note to the BBC explaining the context, Ali's words were almost drowned out by the noise and chaos at the camp.\"[Abdiwahab] keeps asking me about his parents. I decided to take him home until we found them,\" Ali says.He noticed how the boy was traumatised, fearing that any light appearing at night was an RSF vehicle coming to get him.\"He saw a light in the distance and held me tight, screaming. He froze.\"ReutersAid agencies are overwhelmed by the number of people who need helpAli says each new arrival to the camp carries a story of survival and despair.There are many unaccompanied minors, including children who lost their parents on the road, coming in every day.\"Just yesterday, twin children around 10 years old arrived with a woman who said their parents had died on the way,\" the volunteer aid worker says.\"The situation is terrifying. People continue arriving with many conditions, some with injuries and malnutrition. Those who arrived are begging us to go and save the people on the road, because many are dying trying to come to Tawila,\" Ali says.Survivors spoke of \"passing dead bodies scattered along the road and hearing the cries of the wounded calling for help\".But even relief work has become deadly.Ali says the organisations operating in Tawila are afraid to leave the town after five Red Crescent volunteers were killed in another state earlier this week.\"They are waiting for assurances and confirmation that the situation is safe,\" he says.Many mothers arriving in Tawila are in desperate need of food, water and medical help, according to the charity Save the Children.Some women reported being attacked by armed men on motorbikes and robbed as they fled.\"Women who managed to escape with their children as fighting raged made it to Tawila without food or water. They are now entirely dependent on already stretched humanitarian assistance,\" the aid agency said in a statement.The UN's refugee agency has said it was struggling to find enough shelter and food for civilians seeking refuge in the town.But not everyone is making it out of el-Fasher, where there have been reports of mass killings.This week, RSF leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo admitted to \"violations\" in the city and said they would be investigated. A senior UN official has said that the RSF had given notice that they had arrested some suspects.Estimates vary as to how many civilians are still strapped in the city.Save the Children puts it at more than 260,000 people, including an estimated 130,000 children, who have to contend with famine-like conditions, the collapse of health services and no safe route out.More BBC stories on the conflict:Reports of mass killings in Sudan have echoes of its dark pastMy son's whole body is full of shrapnelRare footage shows plight of civilians in besieged Sudan cityLast surgeons standing in city's only hospitalBBC smuggles in phones to reveal hunger and fearGetty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

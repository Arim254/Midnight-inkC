    "body": "13 hours agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterGetty ImagesA great leader is a huge asset for a company, of course, but can anyone be worth $1 trillion? That is the pay packet Tesla shareholders have approved for Elon Musk, as long as he meets the targets they have set over the next 10 years.In the meantime he won't collect a salary, but will presumably throw himself into his work with renewed vigour.He was certainly buzzing with energy as he jigged around the stage at the carmaker's Texas headquarters to rapturous applause, telling the audience that while other shareholder meetings were \"snoozefests\", Tesla's are \"bangers\".Musk has attracted an army of critics, upset that he sided with US President Donald Trump, wielding his chainsaw at government programmes, and wading into politics overseas with explicit support for the far right. But he has an equally large following of admirers, people who believe in his vision and don't doubt that he can achieve it.It seems most of his shareholders are in this camp, after they backed his new remuneration package this week.Of course shareholders signed up, says New York-based financial analyst Dan Ives. If Musk succeeds - and Ives thinks he will - he will have created trillions of dollars worth of shareholder value, ample payback for investors.Ives sees Musk as a \"modern day Albert Einstein, a Thomas Edison\". Without the stupendous pay package, he says, there was a risk that within a few years Musk would have walked away, taking his Artificial Intellgience (AI) initiatives with him.\"Tesla without Musk is like pizza without cheese,\" he says.Ives does not own shares in Tesla, but analyses the company for his firm Wedbush Securities and thinks Musk's \"ability to go where others are not\" means he may well achieve the targets that have been set.\"There's edgy behaviour, there's haters, but a lot of people love that. And that's why he's the richest person in the world. \"Does it help sell cars in Europe? No. But does it help Tesla win the AI race? Yes.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesMusk's political activities have prompted a backlash from some customers, including demonstrations outside showrooms earlier this year. But Matt Britzman at Hargreaves Lansdown in London, who has invested in Tesla, says the impact is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Tesla's earnings.Far from weighing on the firm's valuation, he reckons around a third of the value of Tesla can be attributed to what he calls the \"Musk premium\", value that wouldn't be there without him. \"It's a $1.4 trillion company, not based on the current car business. It's a $1.4 trillion business based on expectations of what it can deliver over the next three years.\"And a lot of those expectations are fixed on Musk and his record of thinking big and thinking long term, he says.The potential reward for Musk is as astronomical as his vision for space travel. With $1 trillion you could buy 20 million Model Y Teslas, at around $50,000 each. Or you could buy yourself a $10m house every day for 250 years, and still have change for furnishing and decorating.The conditions appear to be very testing, including delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots. A million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles will also need to be on the roads. Tesla's overall market value will need to rise from its current $1.4tn to $8.5tn.These are \"incredibly high milestones\", says Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado.However, the board does have \"discretion\" to decide when some of them have been met, she adds. \"If intervening events prevent him from reaching the goals, the board can deem them met anyway.\" So the targets may not turn out to be quite as demanding as they appear.There is also nothing in the terms, no constraint, that prevents Musk continuing to speak out about politics or anything else.\"Even after the pay package was proposed, he didn't pull back from his political commentary,\" adds Prof Lipton.\"So it seems to me that this pay package, whatever the goals are, however lofty they may be, they're not going to inhibit him from involving himself in whatever matters he wants to be involved in.\"That freedom could pose the biggest risk, according to Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive.Musk is a visionary she says, but he's also unpredictable, and it is possible that his other interests may distract him as they have before, leading him to neglect Tesla, which itself is already a smorgasbord of different businesses and challenges.\"I'm hoping that based on his experience with getting politically involved and how that really hurt some of his brand and sales that he has learned to really focus on this business.\"But that's going to be the board's responsibility,\" she adds, \"to make sure that he stays within the guardrails, and that he does what's right for Tesla.\"And if he does, well the sky is the limit, or possibly Mars, for Musk's ambition.\"People laughed when his 2018 pay package was approved,\" says Prof Lipton. \"And he hit those milestones well ahead of schedule.\"",

    "body": "American delivery firms UPS and FedEx have temporarily grounded part of their fleets of cargo planes after a mid-takeoff crash in Kentucky on Tuesday left at least 14 people dead.The UPS aircraft burst into flames as it careered off the runway and collided with neighbouring business premises, triggering a huge fire which gutted several buildings and closed Louisville International Airport.UPS said the decision to ground MD-11 models followed instructions from manufacturer Boeing, while rival delivery giant FedEx confirmed it would follow suit.Officials are yet to determine what caused the deadly crash.Hours before the fleet was grounded, officials confirmed that the death toll had risen to 14 after another body was found, with buildings caught up in the fire still being searched for more victims.\"We pray for each of the victims' families and pray that no additional victims are lost,\" Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said. In a statement, UPS said the decision to ground 9% of its fleet was out of an \"abundance of caution\".It is unclear to what extent delivery services will be impacted by the moves from UPS and Fedex.UPS said contingency plans were in place to continue service. A statement continued: \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"The model of aircraft involved in the crash was a MD-11F triple-engine plane, which first entered service 34 years ago with Thai Airways as a passenger jet, but was transferred to UPS in 2006.MD-11s were originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, before the company merged with Boeing in 1997.According to the National Transportation and Safety Board, the left engine caught fire and detached from the wing during take off.The aircraft was carrying 38,000 gallons (144,000 litres) of fuel as it attempted to disembark for a long flight to Hawaii, which contributed to the size of the fire which broke out after the crash.",

    "body": "41 minutes agoIain Watson,Political correspondent and Patrick Cowling,Producer, BBC Radio 4's Immigration: the Danish WayPA MediaShabana Mahmood sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration systemThe Home Secretary is set to announce a major shake-up of the immigration and asylum system later this month, the BBC has learned.Shabana Mahmood will model some of her new measures on the Danish system - seen as one of the toughest in Europe.It is understood officials have been looking at Denmark's tighter rules on family reunion and restricting most refugees to a temporary stay in the country.Mahmood wants to reduce incentives that draw people to the UK, while making it easier to expel those with no right to be in the country.But some in her party are against going down the Danish route, with one left-wing Labour MP saying it was too \"hardcore\" and contained echoes of the far right.At the Labour conference in September, Mahmood promised to \"do whatever it takes\" to regain control of Britain's borders.She is impressed that Denmark has driven down the number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low - with the exception of 2020, amid pandemic travel restrictions.The BBC has been told she dispatched senior Home Office officials to Copenhagen last month to study what lessons could be applied to the UK.In Denmark, refugees who have been personally targeted by a foreign regime are likely to be given protection.But most people who have been successfully granted asylum when fleeing conflicts are now only allowed to remain in the country on a temporary basis.When the Danish government decrees their home country is safe, they can be returned.For those who have been in Denmark for a longer period, the length of time necessary to acquire settlement rights has been extended and conditions - such as being in full-time employment - have been added.Denmark's tighter rules for family reunions have also attracted the interest of UK Home Office officials.If you are a refugee who has been given residency rights in Denmark, both you and your partner who is applying to join you in the country must be 24 or older.The Danish government says this is to guard against forced marriages.The partner in Denmark must not have claimed benefits for three years and also has to put up a financial guarantee - and both partners have to pass a Danish language test.Refugees who live in housing estates designated as \"parallel societies\"- that is where more than 50% of residents are from what the Danish government considers to be \"non-Western\" backgrounds - will not be eligible for family reunion at all.In September, the UK Home Office suspended new applications under the Refugee Family Reunion scheme, pending the drawing up of new rules.The pre-September scheme allowed spouses, partners and dependents under 18 to come to the UK without fulfilling the income and English-language tests that apply to other migrants.Mahmood is unlikely to go as far as Denmark when she announces the UK's replacement rules for family reunions, but it seems likely that she will take steps along a more restrictive route.Rasmus Stoklund says Denmark's biggest challenge is expelling foreign criminalsLast week, the BBC also made the journey to Denmark to find out how their immigration system operates.Mahmood's opposite number Rasmus Stoklund, Denmark's minister for Immigration and Integration, is a member of Labour's sister party the Social Democrats.He said \"We have tightened our laws in many ways. \"We return more people back home. We have made it quite difficult to have family reunification in Denmark.\"You will get expelled a lot easier if you commit crimes. And we have made different programmes to help people go back home voluntarily.\"There is no indication the UK government would follow the Danish example of offering substantial sums - as much as the equivalent of £24,000 - for asylum seekers to return their country of origin, including making a contribution to the cost of their children's education.But some of what Stoklund outlined is being closely scrutinised in the Home Office, the BBC understands.According to Stoklund, tighter immigration and integration is about protecting the societal nature of Denmark, which is a smaller country with a lower population than the UK.\"We expect people who come here to participate and contribute positively and if they don't, they aren't welcome,\" he said.In Denmark - as in the UK - there is a live political debate on whether the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) makes the expulsion of foreign criminals more difficult.Like the UK government, Stoklund does not want to leave the ECHR but believes changes could be made.The Danish government has launched a review into how this could be done and Stoklund agreed he could make common cause with his British counterparts.\"I think it's very positive every time I hear that other countries have the same concerns and are frustrated the same way as many of us in Denmark are.\"Mahmood is said to be keen to meet Stoklund at the earliest opportunity.Getty ImagesIda Auken says a tougher stance on immigration neutralises a toxic issueFor Labour ministers, there are political, as well as practical lessons, to learn from Denmark.In 2015, the country had a centre-left government in trouble and a right-wing populist party surging in the polls, with immigration increasingly worrying voters.There are parallels with the UK today, as Reform UK maintains its poll lead over Labour. Downing Street is interested in how a centre-left party managed to defeat the Danish People's Party, one-time allies of Nigel Farage's UKIP in the European Parliament, to return to power.Ida Auken, the Social Democrats' environment spokesperson, said adopting a tougher stance on immigration meant there was space to pursue progressive policies in other areas.\"For us, it was a licence to operate on the things we want to do,\" she said.\"We want have a workforce that are educated, that have a social security and we do want to do a green transition.\"And we would never have been able to do this unless we've had those strict migration policies.\"Some senior ministers in the UK are thought to find that argument persuasive.Getty ImagesUK officials have been spending time in CopenhagenCritics would point out that while there are similarities with the UK, the situation in Denmark is different.The country is not facing small boats arrivals from the North Sea or the Baltic.Danish is not as widely spoken as English, so language requirements likely discourage some potential refugees.And while the vast majority of Social Democrat parliamentarians were on board for more hardline policies, there is far more wariness amongst some Labour MPs.Off the record, some mainstream Labour MPs say they would oppose the transplantation of Danish policies to the UK.On the left of the party, former frontbencher Clive Lewis argued strongly against adopting the Danish system in an effort to outflank Reform UK.\"Denmark's Social Democrats have gone down, what I would call a hardcore approach to immigration,\" he said.\"They've adopted many of the talking points of what we would call the far right.\"Labour does need to win back some Reform-leaning voters but you can't do that at the cost of losing progressive votes.\"Jo White, who leads a 50-strong group of Labour MPs in \"Red Wall\" seats in the Midlands and North of England, would like to see ministers go further in a Danish direction.She argued that Labour would pay a heavy political price if it does not adopt policies such as requiring some asylum seekers to contribute to the cost of their stay.\"The consequences are that we go into a general election where Reform will be the biggest challenger in most Labour seats... and we will be annihilated.\"Immigration: the Danish Way will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 GMT on Sunday, 9 November, and will be available on BBC Sounds.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNoor Nanji & Emma SaundersCulture reportersBBCCat Burns, Joe Marler and Nick Mohammed have had their profiles boosted by the showSpoiler warning: This article reveals details from The Celebrity TraitorsBy now, you’ll probably know who’s won The Celebrity Traitors.But some of the other contestants could end up being the real winners from the hit TV series.Cat Burns, Joe Marler and Nick Mohammed have been widely tipped by industry experts as the names most likely to see the biggest career boost thanks to their appearance on the show.Compared with the likes of Sir Stephen Fry and Celia Imrie, they were relatively less well known when entering the castle.But all three have been \"magnificently entertaining\", and could find themselves facing a string of lucrative offers, TV reporter Siobhan Synnot tells BBC News.We've been looking at who the breakout stars of the series are - and what might lie ahead for them.Cat BurnsThe singer-songwriter, 25, sailed all the way to the final, her cool-as-a-cucumber persona making her a traitor to be reckoned with.Burns first got everyone talking during an early task involving a general knowledge quiz, in which she confessed she didn't know who Dame Judi Dench or Dame Helen Mirren were (although she later said she would have recognised their faces).Celebrity Traitors fans have enjoyed her quick thinking and acting ability, and she managed to slip under the radar for most of the game.In Thursday night's nail-biting finale, her luck ran out - as she was banished at the roundtable despite making a pinky promise with fellow traitor Alan Carr, who went on to win.But this is far from the last we've seen of Burns.Her second album, How To Be Human, has just been released - our colleague, music correspondent Mark Savage, said it showed a softer side to the Traitors star.She's all over social media (what are we supposed to do without those epic cloaked Cat-Alan videos now the show is over?)And last weekend, she even made a special performance on another prime-time BBC One show, Sunday night's Strictly results show.Culture journalist Natalie Jamieson says she hopes Burns can do \"whatever she wants next\".\"She's a brilliant singer-songwriter already, and no doubt has her own ambitions and career plans - but I'd bet there's still a degree of her being seen by some as 'just' a musician.\"None of us are just one thing, and if her success on Celebrity Traitors broadens the minds of any industry gatekeepers to open doors or create unexpected opportunities, or just ask if she wants to be in the room where something is happening, then Cat can choose if that's what she wants.\"Joe MarlerThe former rugby union star, 35, has won over a whole new audience beyond sport thanks to his bromance with comedian Joe Wilkinson, his super-sleuthing, balletic bridge balancing and all-round wit.Speaking about his faithful nemesis on Traitors Uncloaked, traitor Jonathan Ross said of Marler: \"I think this show will do him a lot of good because people will see just how funny he is and how smart he is and how likeable he is.\"And that was always there, but it was hidden behind that gruff man mountain exterior.\"Along with Wilkinson, Marler was the architect of the epic Big Dog theory involving Ross and Fry.And rather than fly under the radar, Marler took the risk of spouting his theories openly, and was arguably the most bullish at the roundtables, even managing to ruffle Carr's feathers.\"Joe Marler has undoubtedly become a breakout star of the show due to his authentic personality and deadpan humour,\" says entertainment reporter Indigo Stafford.\"He also seems to be one of the only faithfuls this season to actually have had a clue who the traitors might be, yet he cleverly managed to conceal how much of a threat he is to them in order to not get eliminated [until the very end].\"I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a huge career boost for him after he left the show.\"Marler signed up with talent agency M+C Saatchi earlier this year, and there are already rumours that he is set for more mainstream TV opportunities, which Stafford says would \"make sense\".\"Having retired from his impressive England rugby career, he will be looking to move on to the next big thing - the world of showbiz,\" she said.Meanwhile TV reporter Siobhan Synnot thinks Marler could be heading for next year's Strictly. We can see him doing the Viennese Waltz already.Nick MohammedThe comedian and actor has hugely grown his fan base during his appearance on Celebrity Traitors.He'd already starred in hit TV shows like Ted Lasso and Slow Horses, but despite that, not everyone knew who he was before the show.While big personalities like Carr and Ross may have immediately stolen the limelight, Nick has gained a cult following due to his whip-smart - and often, spot on - theories, his cool, calm demeanour, and the way he powered through the tasks like a man possessed.He attracted attention early on when helping Imrie secure the final shield in the first mission, protecting her from murder by digging up her grave.But it was his incredibly speedy puzzle skills in the Trojan Horse challenge that really caught the eye.\"Celebrity Traitors has introduced him to a whole new audience that are obsessed with his sharp observations and intelligent gameplay. Moving forward, I could totally imagine Nick hosting a new game show,\" says Stafford.Synnot agrees: \"Nick and his gift for unravelling puzzles may find himself inundated with quiz host offers.\"And what's in store for the others...Burns, Marler and Mohammed aren't the only ones who will see a huge boost from their time on the show.Since his spectacular win on Thursday, social media has blown up with speculation that Carr could be the next host of Strictly Come Dancing.The BBC has not commented. But just imagine that. Winning Celebrity Traitors, then landing one of the most coveted roles on British television.Synnot, for her part, suspects he could end up going in a more unexpected direction.\"Sweaty Alan Carr is a cert for Sure adverts,\" she says. If you know, you know.And what for Imrie, the beloved veteran actress who stole the show with her nervous fart in episode three?\"Maybe Pepto Bismol can make a deal for her,\" jokes Synnot.You heard it here first.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, in KyivBBCThe Kyiv Opera's latest show, Patriots, is a rock opera which features popular anthems of Ukrainian independence I've never heard an audience so silent.When the credits rolled on a screening of 2000 metres to Andriivka, no-one in the Kyiv cinema moved. Their popcorn and beer were mostly untouched.The documentary by Mstyslav Chernov is a frontline film so intense you feel like you're trapped in the terrifying trenches alongside the soldiers.Watching that in Ukraine, a country under fire, the intensity is multiplied.At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, as society mobilised to defend itself, Ukraine had little capacity for culture. Venues were closed or repurposed, some were attacked, and artists became refugees or soldiers.Almost four years on, the arts are back - but everything is now permeated by the war.Global Images Ukraine2000 metres to Andriivka has been selected as the Ukrainian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 98th Academy AwardsThe change struck me on a recent trip to Kyiv.I realised that city walls were plastered with two kinds of poster: fundraisers for forces on the frontline - or films, plays and exhibitions about the war.Andriivka wasn't the only hard hitting film on offer: there were also ads for Kuba and Alyaska, another powerful documentary that follows two female combat medics in a way that manages to be funny, frightening and tragic at the same time.There was unflinching photography, too.The old Lenin Museum, now Ukrainian House, was hosting a giant retrospective of the work of documentary photographer Oleksandr Glyadelov.Stretched over three floors of the spiralling modernist building, his images captured the span of Ukraine's struggle for independence: 35 years trying to wrest itself from Russian control.In the section devoted to 2022 and beyond, he'd displayed his photos of victims' bodies on the ground to look like graves.Some I talked to in Kyiv shy away from all of this.War is their reality: it's what keeps them up at night, with the air defence guns and missile warnings. It's all over their social media feeds and it's in their fears for friends and family who are fighting.It is the last thing they want more of, on stage or screen.But others are clearly drawn to it.Getty ImagesMstyslav Chernov won the 2024 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film for his film 20 Days in MariupolAndriivka is Chernov's latest production after his film from besieged Mariupol won an Oscar.His focus this time is a 2km-long strip of land in eastern Ukraine. The soldiers call it a forest, though it's just a line of scraggy trees separating them from Russian positions. Their mission is to cross it and reclaim Andriivka, hanging Ukraine's national flag on the ruins.So the men in the trenches dart between foxholes, guided by soldiers in the rear who monitor from drones and warn of any threat they see. They control the real-life troops as in a computer game but their faces are stony, their focus total.The soldiers' lives depend on them.When it's over, the audience around me seem stunned.\"Someone I know was in this movie, a soldier, and he died,\" Yulia shares, when people eventually file out into the foyer.She says it was a tough watch. \"I think we have to do it, though. We can't forget them.\"An older man openly admits he'd viewed the film through tears. \"Some moments were really, really hard,\" Taras says.But he's sure such films are necessary.\"Maybe people will realise that Ukraine needs all the help possible to end this,\" Taras argues. \"So many people have been killed because we refuse to be what we're not. We are not Russian.\"Rock opera director Petro Kachanov says that he was pressured to give his show a happy ending but after four years of war, he refused out of respect for the militaryIt's not only the \"serious\" arts tackling the war these days. Musicals, the ultimate form of escapism, are in on the act too.Just over the road from the cinema, I spotted a banner for the latest offering from the Kyiv Opera: Patriot, a rock opera in two acts.\"It's the story of any one of us,\" the director explains, one that takes the hero on a journey through Ukraine's recent history - from revolution to war.All the songs are hugely popular anthems of Ukrainian independence so the audience on premiere night whooped along, swept to their feet at times. There were cheers for the policeman on stage in a fat suit doing pelvic thrusts, and the woman in a leotard and tights shredding a portrait of Vladimir Putin.It was all a million miles from the films watched in silence across the road.But director Petro Kachanov told me that even musical theatre has a mission now.\"We have to do everything to demonstrate that Russia is our age-old enemy,\" he was candid. \"The Russians are not our brothers. They are killing our people. They want to take away our freedom and we must say this.\"His team had pressured him to give the show a happy ending for a public exhausted by four years of open war, but he refused.\"This play is a tribute to those who died in this war,\" he told me. \"And we cannot think about our own comfort when the best sons of Ukraine are dying.\"In the rock opera Patriots, a performer shreds a photo of Russian president Vladimir PutinThe same ethos is driving the current \"explosion\" of documentaries.Since February 2022, TV news channels in Ukraine have towed the official line and told reassuring stories in the name of unity. But independent filmmakers zoom in on the hardship.\"People who want to know truth, they go to the cinema,\" Olha Birzul is blunt.She says that role was \"born on the Maidan\", shorthand for the mass protests in 2014 that eventually swept a pro-Russian president from power. When crowds occupied Kyiv's main square in 2014, those who could film began recording everything. \"So when the full-scale invasion happened, they were ready.\"Ultimately, the films they are producing today are heroic tales: the enemy and the cause are clear. But they also expose the harshest of realities of this war and its true cost.Olha's own husband was killed fighting in 2022 and, for her, such films are a way of recording Ukrainians' sacrifice and honouring their memory.\"It's a form of justice,\" she says.\"We would really like to watch other movies – maybe some comedies or some drama,\" is how one filmgoer, Natalia, put it on her way out of a screening of Kuba and Alyaska.\"Of course I don't want to watch these movies, but I have to, like everyone else. Because it's our history and it's our present day.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyWatch: Key moments from the 'Nest-flix' 2025 chicksSince the end of August, tens of thousands of Australians have been tuning in to \"Nest-flix\", a high drama 24-hour reality channel that first became a hit during the Covid pandemic.Sometimes compared to Game of Thrones, it features airborne fights, cuckolds, births, breakups and earthquakes, courtesy of its stars - the peregrine falcons who live at the top of a Melbourne skyscraper.Currently fans are waiting for the moment when this year's chicks, which began hatching at the end of September, attempt their first flight.They can be seen running up and down flapping their wings on the ledge – 34 storeys high – while their mother has been flying past with pigeons in her talons. \"She's teasing the chicks, going 'You wanna eat? Well you gotta fly',\" says Dr Victor Hurley, founder of the Victorian Peregrine Project.The goading and deliberate reduction in food encourages them to fly and helps them lose weight, he says. \"Their wings are growing and getting bigger and they get a better wing load ratio to wing load area so they can lift off easier.\"The launch of 'Nest-flix'Dr Hurley was first tipped off to the peregrine nesting site on the office building at 367 Collins Street in 1991, the year he established the Victorian Peregrine Project, a volunteer group dedicated to the preservation of the species.But he realised the falcons were having no success because they had laid their eggs in a metal gutter, which acts as a heat sink, drawing warmth away from the nest. \"Rain gutters in winter in Melbourne, that was always going to end badly,\" he says.Dr Hurley recommended the building managers put in a nest box - which they agreed to do - and the following year three chicks were born.  A CCTV camera was put in to observe the nest in 1993 and every year at breeding time Dr Hurley would drag his large screen TV into the foyer so that people in the building could watch.Then in 2017 a webcam was installed and \"Nest-flix\" was broadcast live on YouTube. The falcons also have their own Facebook fan page with more than 50,000 members. \"It's quite a supportive corner of the internet where people just enjoy watching birds,\" says Kylie Humrick, who joined the group in 2017 and has since become one of its moderators. \"During Covid the group just exploded because it gave people a sense of connection to the world around them.\"\"We hear a lot about how wildlife is struggling and it's good to see some birds that are thriving in the built environment,\" she adds. A favourite moment was in 2021 when the livestream captured a falcon being startled off the nest by an earthquake.Watch: The peregrine falcon’s viral moment reacting to a 2021 Melbourne earthquakeFights and 'floaters'Over the years the nest has been inhabited by six to seven different pairs of falcons, possibly more. The piece of central Melbourne real estate is \"highly prized\" by the birds, Dr Hurley says. \"There's a guarantee of hot and cold running pigeons and sparrows all year round. So food's laid on for them.\"This, and the fact that peregrine falcons are extremely territorial - the closest they'll nest to each other is about 1.6km - has led to some spectacular fights over the nesting site with \"floaters\" - peregrines who haven't paired off or established their own territory - launching raids.In 2022, drama ensued when a male falcon (described as \"wimpy\" by Dr Hurley) was replaced by a younger bird halfway through the incubation period after a weeks-long battle.The older male was almost certainly killed by the \"step-father\" who was \"rubbish\" at his new incubation duties, says Dr Hurley, although he notes that at least he didn't eat the chicks when they hatched as has been known to happen and did in fact provide them with their first feed.\"People started referring to him as the dad that stepped up,\" says Ms Humrick.Then in 2023, the resident female falcon appeared to have sustained brain damage after getting \"beaten up\" by another female. \"She retained the territory for a couple of weeks but she was standing next to the eggs all night one night in winter so she was clearly not alright,\" says Dr Hurley. There were no chicks that year.Years earlier another female falcon was killed in a seven-hour fight that was so loud the building managers called Dr Hurley.Dr Hurley emphasises that these behaviours are natural and has rejected entreaties from falcon watchers to intervene. \"These things kills other birds for a living, that's their specialty and when they're taking over nests there's no prisoner abuse scandal, they just kill each other.\"Peregrine falcons, which were once nearly wiped out in Australia due to the use of pesticides in agriculture, have staged a recovery since the 1980s when DDT and other chemicals were banned. The birds - known as the fastest animals on earth, reaching speeds of up to 389km/h - are now to be found in almost every major city across the country, where tall buildings mimic the cliffs they prefer in nature.The peregrine chicks are expected to fledge any day nowBut they still face challenges, not least their first flight, which for the chicks at 367 Collins Street is expected any day soon. The male chick is expected to fly first, possibly as early as Saturday, followed around a week later by his two sisters. Female chicks are typically 30% heavier than their brothers, so they take a little longer to develop the necessary strength to fly.Dr Hurley hopes they all take their time as that means \"they'll be stronger and more capable\"; an ill-timed gust of wind could blow them into a window or they could land badly. One of last year's chicks had to spend several weeks at a rehabilitation centre after becoming trapped behind a glass balcony screen on another skyscraper.Once they make their first kill they'll be on their own, potentially chased out of the territory altogether depending on the ruthlessness of their parents. A 60% mortality rate in the first year means it's a \"tough gig\" being a young peregrine falcon, Dr Hurley observes, adding that such a rate is common among predators.\"If every lion that was born survived to become an adult and breed, you'd run out of zebra and wildebeest pretty quick.\"It's not clear what has happened to the earlier chicks from Collins Street despite up to 40 being banded, but they will usually travel tens of kilometres away to establish their own territories and avoid inbreeding. If they survive their second year - two thirds do not - they can begin breeding at three.Among the Facebook watchers excitement is building ahead of the expected fledging. \"Headed to Melbourne soon and binoculars already packed, hoping to spot them!\" one group member posted this week. \"Be still my freaked out heart,\" another wrote as one chick perched close to the edge of the ledge.\"It's always an exciting time in the group, viewership definitely goes up the closer we get to fledging. People look forward to seeing them go out into the world,\" says Ms Humrick. \"We don't know what happens to them after they fledge but it's nice to see them reach that milestone.\"",

    "body": "Israel has received a coffin that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said contains the body of a hostage, Israel's military says.Hamas's armed wing said the body had been found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The body has been transported to Israel via the Red Cross for identification.Before this handover, Hamas had returned all 20 living hostages and 22 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis and one was Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 68,875 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

The news came as Kenny Craig, an accountant with insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, was named as trustee in sequestration of the former first minister's estate.This is a professional appointed to manage the bankruptcy process in Scotland and follows an application by Salmond's widow Moira.It emerged last week that Salmond's estate had been forced to seek the equivalent of bankruptcy over the cost of court action taken against the Scottish government in the final years of his life.The firm said part of that process will involve considering the value of the legal action the former SNP leader was pursuing over the handling of a misconduct investigation into him.Salmond previously won £512,000 from the Scottish government after it was found the process in handling harassment complaints against him by civil servants was \"tainted with apparent bias\".He was later acquitted of a number of sexual misconduct charges at a criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.Begbies Traynor, which describes itself as the \"UK's leading corporate rescue and recovery practice\", confirmed the winding-up of Salmond's estate would include considering the value of all assets, including rights of action raised against the Scottish government.At the time of his death in October 2024, the former first minister had raised further proceedings seeking damages against the government he once led.Thomas McKay, managing partner for Begbies Traynor in Scotland, said: \"This is an unusual and complex appointment, particularly because it involves ongoing legal proceedings by a high-profile individual against the Scottish government.\"Kenny Craig, supported by our personal insolvency team at Begbies Traynor Group, will of course do all that he can to manage the sequestration as respectfully and sensitively as possible.\"Salmond died after suffering a heart attack while attending an event in North Macedonia.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th Century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside British scientist Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But Watson's reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made claims about genes causing a difference in average IQ between black and white people.His death was confirmed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades, before having to resign as its chancellor over the comments.Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Francis Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. By the early 2000s, he had been largely ostracised by the scientific community over his comments on race and gender.In 2007, the scientist told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".He apologised \"unreservedly\", but nevertheless, the comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.Additional comments he made in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led to the lab stripping his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement at the time.DNA was discovered in 1869 but it took until 1943 for scientists to discover that it made up the genetic material in cells. Still, the structure of DNA remained a mystery. Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure. Franklin, who died in 1958, is today recognised for the integral role she played in the scientific breakthrough of DNA research, despite her work largely being written out of the story at the time.Former colleagues have commented that Watson nurtured the careers of female scientists at Harvard in the 1950s and 60s, at a time when that was not the norm. However he also made disparaging comments about women in science, and wrote sexist remarks about Franklin, including commenting on her appearance, in his 1968 best-selling book, The Double Helix.Watson became the first living Nobel laureate to sell his gold medal, fetching $4.8m (£3.6m) at an auction in 2014, saying he was letting go of it because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his controversial remarks.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.James Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge University in England, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom was diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, further motivating Watson's research to learn more about DNA in the hope of possibly helping him.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

    "body": "Whip restored to four Labour MPs after rebellion10 hours agoNeve Gordon-FarleighUK ParliamentChris Hinchliff said his focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire Four MPs who were suspended from the Labour Party after rebelling against welfare reforms have had their whips restored.Chris Hinchliff, for North East Hertfordshire, was suspended alongside Neil Duncan-Jordan, MP for Poole, Brian Leishman, MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, and Rachael Maskell, MP for York Central, after they voted against the government's Welfare Reform Bill in July.The BBC understands they had the whip restored after discussions with chief whip Jonathan Reynolds on Friday.Hinchliff said: \"As ever, my focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire and contributing to Labour's historic mission to create a society that puts people and nature before profit.\"Prior to their suspensions, all four MPs had rebelled against the government on several occasions. The group were among 47 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's proposed cuts to welfare in July and forced ministers to water down their plans.The rebellion undermined Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's authority, which was weakened after a series of policy reversals, including restoring the Winter Fuel Payment to millions of pensioners.At the time of their suspension, Starmer said he was \"determined\" to change the country \"for the better\". He said: \"Therefore, we have to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip.\"Hinchliff said he welcomed the whip back and added he had \"constructive discussions\" with the new chief whip in recent months.PA MediaNeil Duncan-Jordan says he will continue to work hard for his Poole constituentsDuncan-Jordan said he was \"glad\" to have the whip restored. \"I've been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I'm pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.\"I'll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values - tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society,\" he added.  Maskell said she was \"grateful\" that she had been given the whip back. \"I recognise the heavy responsibility on Labour to repair our public services and economy after 14 disastrous years and above all to lift people out of poverty. \"With 4.5m children living in poverty tonight, I am focused on ensuring they have the very best start in life,\" she added. The move comes as the party faces a difficult month in government with growing concern among Labour MPs that taxes will have to rise in the upcoming budget. Newly elected Labour deputy leader, Lucy Powell, urged the government not to raise taxes in the next budget. Powell told the BBC the government \"should be following through\" on its manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national tax or VAT. More on this story",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick Eardley,Political Correspondent and Sima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondentPA MediaAt least four prisoners released in error are still at large, the BBC has been told.These are among 262 prisoners in England and Wales mistakenly released in the year to March - up from 115 the previous year.The new information comes as the government is under increasing pressure after a number of high-profile cases of prisoners being wrongly released.An Algerian sex offender who was mistakenly released from prison was arrested by police on Friday.Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was one of two men separately released by mistake from the prison in the same week. Both are now back in custody, after William Smith handed himself in on Thursday.Watch: Moment wrongly released prisoner Kaddour-Cherif is arrestedTheir releases came after migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex late last month.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.\"But there has been widespread criticism of the government's handling of the issue.The unaccounted prisoners reveal \"the incompetence of this government\", shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said.\"It shouldn't be left to reporters to uncover the facts. [Justice Secretary] David Lammy must finally come clean about how many prisoners have been accidentally released and how many are still at large.\"A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said \"every resource\" must go into finding the prisoners. \"This is a disgrace and an omnishambles. It shouldn't have to take the media to inform the public that prisoners are at large after accidental release,\" Jess Brown-Fuller said.In a statement, Lammy said: \"We inherited a prison system in crisis and I'm appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing.\"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"That is why I have ordered new tough release checks, commissioned an independent investigation into systemic failures, and begun overhauling archaic paper-based systems still used in some prisons.\"The revelation that four prisoners are still at large after being wrongly released came just hours after Kaddour-Cherif was arrested.The Algerian national was spotted by a member of the public in the Finsbury Park area of London just on Friday morning.He was convicted of indecent exposure in November 2024, relating to an incident in March of that year.He was given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.He had been let out of HMP Wandsworth in south London on 29 October, though police said they were not told until Tuesday.Kaddour-Cherif is understood to have entered the UK legally on a visitor's visa in 2019, but overstayed that and was in the initial stages of the deportation process.He was released the day after being found not guilty of breaching the sex offenders' register's requirements - but he was still facing other charges and should have remained in custody.The prison officers' representatives said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold him, and he was let go.It followed a series of prosecutions and court appearances dating back two years.William Smith, the second man released from HMP Wandsworth in the past week, handed himself back in on Thursday. He had been let go on Monday having been sentenced to prison earlier that day.Prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years. The population has continued to balloon, with the number of staff not keeping pace with the number of inmates.Only a hundred or so places were available in male prisons last summer. This triggered the government's emergency release scheme - where some inmates would be freed after serving 40% of their fixed term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. It was implemented to reduce overcrowding and already almost 40,000 inmates have been let out under the scheme.But this has also had repercussions on the number of mistaken releases.The government has pledged to build more prisons to ease overcrowding, with projections showing the prison population will continue to grow but this will take time.Additional reporting by George Wright",

    "body": "10 hours agoHarry LowLondonPA MediaSix Charing Cross police station officers have now been dismissed in the wake of the Panorama investigationA Metropolitan Police sergeant who said a detainee \"deserves to be beaten up\" has become the sixth officer based at Charing Cross police station to be sacked following a BBC investigation.Lawrence Hume, a detention sergeant, was dismissed on Friday at an accelerated misconduct hearing, which also heard he used a derogatory term to describe the detainee.October's Panorama programme showed officers calling for immigrants to be shot, revelling in the use of force and being dismissive of rape claims.Cdr Simon Messenger said Sgt Hume had \"demonstrated a blatant disregard for the protection of the public and the professional standards expected of a serving police officer\".Cdr Messenger told the hearing in south London: \"It is right he has been dismissed as we work tirelessly to raise standards and improve the culture across our organisation.\"In a six-minute clip, which was played to the panel several times, Sgt Hume also said of the same detainee, \"Charge him, send him to prison, throw away the key,\" adding, \"Don't care, deserves to be beaten up don't he.\"Panel chairman Cdr Jason Prins found Sgt Hume's behaviour amounted to gross misconduct and dismissed him without notice.Cdr Prins said the sergeant was \"unable to provide a satisfying answer\" as to why he had said a detainee deserved to be beaten up.\"He made the comments on two occasions unprompted,\" Cdr Prins added. \"He was in a leadership position responsible for the welfare of detainees.\"An allegation that Sgt Hume's comments indicated a clear intention to minimise and not record levels of force used in custody was found to be unproven.'Scum'On 28 October, Sgt Clayton Robinson was dismissed after a panel heard he had \"trivialised the allegation\" of a woman during a rape investigation and \"mocked the victim\" by singing a song with another officer.PC Jason Sinclair-Birt was dismissed on 24 October after being secretly filmed \"boasting about and revelling in the use of force\" on a detainee.A day earlier, Sgt Joe McIlvenny, PC Philip Neilson and PC Martin Borg were dismissed after allegations of gross misconduct were upheld.Sgt McIlvenny was filmed being dismissive about a pregnant woman's allegation of rape and domestic violence against her partner and making misogynistic comments.PC Neilson was recorded referring to an \"invasion\" of \"scum\" from the Middle East, and made offensive comments about people from Algeria and Somalia.Another three officers - PC Sean Park, PC Brian Sharkey and Sgt Steve Stamp - are due to face hearings as part of the Met's accelerated misconduct proceedings in the wake of the 1 October broadcast.A further allegation against Sgt Hume, that he had failed to challenge or report Sgt McIlvenny's remarks after being informed of them, was also found to be unproven.Amanda Rowe, director at the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said Sgt Hume's comments were \"unacceptable and completely unprofessional\".She added: \"A panel has found that the officer breached the police standards of professional behaviour relating to authority, respect and courtesy, and discreditable conduct, and it's right that he has been dismissed from the force.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoKirstie BrewerBBC News BBCTwo Kurdish men agreed to go undercover for the BBC and expose a network behind illegal High Street businesses because the criminals are causing harm to the reputation of Kurds in the UK, they say.The two, who we are calling Saman and Ali, are Kurdish reporters who have both lived legally in the UK for years.The BBC discovered that a Kurdish crime network was running mini-marts, barbershops and car washes the length of Britain, and wanted to find out more about how it operated and who was involved.Equipped with secret cameras, Saman and Ali posed as Kurdish asylum seekers with no right to work, looking to buy and run a mini-mart from which to sell illegal cigarettes and vapes.They were able to uncover how easy it is for someone in these circumstances to set up and run a business on the High Street in plain sight. Those involved, we discovered, pay Kurds who have UK citizenship to register the businesses in their names, helping fool the authorities.Saman and Ali also managed to secretly film one of those at the centre of the network, who claimed that he could erase government fines of up to £60,000 faced by those employing illegal workers.\"I wanted to play a role in uncovering these illegal activities [...] to say loudly that they don't represent us,\" says Saman, a former asylum seeker himself. Saman entered the country illegally, having fled Kurdistan  - a region that straddles the borders of Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria but which is not internationally recognised as a country - because his life was at risk.The reporters acknowledge that tensions over illegal immigration are high in the UK and say they have both been worried that the investigation could inflame hostilities.But Ali says that the illegal working \"damages the whole Kurdish community\" and he feels compelled to \"bring it [the criminal network] out into broad daylight\".Separately, Ali says he was concerned the coverage could be seized upon by the far-right.He says this particularly struck him when he realised that far-right activist Tommy Robinson's Unite the Kingdom march was taking place in London on one of the weekends he was working undercover for the BBC. Placards and flags could be seen at the rally, reading \"we want our country back\".Saman and Ali have both been monitoring social media reaction to the BBC investigation from inside the Kurdish community and say it has sparked intense anger for some. One Facebook comment they spotted said: \"How can we identify and find [the undercover reporters] to kill them like dogs!\"Another called for their families in Kurdistan to be slaughtered.They have also read accusations that they were spies for the British government, and traitors to fellow Kurds. \"We are not spies, and we have no intention of harming the Kurdish community,\" Saman says. \"Our goal is to expose those who have damaged its reputation. We are proud of our Kurdish identity and deeply concerned about the actions of such individuals.\"Watch: BBC's Ed Thomas confronts Surchi of the Top Store mini-mart in CreweAli says he has also come across positive reaction, praising and defending the reporters for exposing wrongdoing and criminality.He says some young Kurdish men come to the UK having heard they can make money by selling illegal cigarettes.Reacting to our investigation, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said on Tuesday that these kinds of networks \"create an incentive for people to come here illegally\". An \"urgent investigation\" has now been launched by the Home Office, it confirmed.Ali stresses that a small percentage of Kurds based in the UK are involved: \"Maybe a minority in the community are involved in this illicit business - damaging the whole community.\"It is difficult to establish the exact size of the UK's Kurdish population - official records tend to log nationality rather than ethnicity. The Kurdish Community Centre in Haringey, London, suggests there are a little more than 500,000.Young Kurdish men \"have heard that illegal cigarettes can make you money in the UK\", says AliMost of those seeking asylum say they are fleeing political persecution, according to Ibrahim Avicil from the Refugee Workers Cultural Association (RWCA), a charity that supports refugees and asylum seekers in the UK.This was the case for our undercover reporter Saman, who, when he first came to the UK, struggled for years. He says he had to live on less than £20 a week while his asylum claim was considered.Asylum seekers now receive about £49 a week - or £9.95 if they are in accommodation which provides meals, according to Home Office guidance.\"Realistically speaking, this isn't enough to maintain a dignified life,\" says Mr Avicil from the RWCA.Because asylum seekers are largely prevented from working, he feels many are open to being exploited and are effectively \"forced to work in the illegal market for as low as £3 per hour\".A spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"We make no apology for not granting asylum seekers the right to work - doing so would create an incentive for people to come to the UK illegally.\"Asylum cases can take years to be resolved with nearly a third taking more than 12 months, according to government figures from the end of March this year.Saman says working illegally in a car wash, barbershop or mini-mart would have been very easy to do, but he told us he would never have done that.However, he says that those he met working in illegal mini-marts during his work with the BBC investigation seemed \"lost\", especially those whose asylum claim has been refused and who were in the appeals process.\"They used all their money to come to the UK, they had their asylum refused and now they've lost everything.\"Saman and Ali say illegal working \"damages the whole Kurdish community\"Ali agrees that these people seemed desperate.\"If [they] say you're not allowed to work - but also [you] don't get paid enough to survive - what are you supposed to do? Most people in this situation would do anything.\"But they also point out that there are people who they exposed in the criminal network that are not in need - they seem to be motivated by greed.Shaxawan - a Kurdish man exposed to be a key fixer in the network - drives a BMW, he points out.\"He just wants to get richer and richer. He is exploiting people put in a vulnerable position.\"Saman describes these people as \"shamelessly and ruthlessly\" exploiting the system, and says that \"many of these people are clever and find loopholes to deceive\" the authorities.But he is at pains to stress that there is nevertheless a sense of \"honour, kindness, and hospitality\" in the Kurdish community. He is worried that \"now the image of Kurds in Britain is changing and becoming negative\".He says: \"I want to show the true image of Kurds and make it clear that we are not involved in these illegal activities.\"",

    "body": "Thousands of US flights cancelled or delayed over government shutdown cuts6 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,at Washington's Reagan National Airport, Ana Faguy,Washington  and Nardine Saad,Los Angeles Watch: \"Devastating\" - Airline travellers react to flight reductionsMore than 5,000 US flights were cancelled or delayed on Friday, in the first day of new mandates forcing airlines to reduce air traffic during the government shutdown.The new rules went into effect on Friday at 40 of the country's biggest airports to ease pressure on air traffic controllers and other federal workers reporting to work without pay amid the historic federal funding impasse.Essential employees have been calling in sick or taking side jobs to make ends meet since the shutdown started last month.To manage staffing shortages, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency order mandating a 4% cut to flights - which will rise to 10% by the end of next week.The mandate  - impacting major travel hubs in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington DC - came down as air traffic controllers had been reporting fatigue during staffing shortages as they work to ensure that US airspace remains safe for passengers, according to the FAA.Air traffic controllers at the centre of the issueAs essential workers, air traffic controllers are required to continue working without pay during the shutdown - which has become the longest ever in US history. Continuing to work without pay for more than a month has led many to become ill with stress and forced others to take on second jobs to keep food on the table, unions for the employees have said.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told the BBC on Friday that the flight cut mandate has not yet affected international travel due to international agreements that the US has to abide by. But the chaos at airports could be just beginning. Duffy said in an interview with Fox News that cuts to flights could hit 20% if the government shutdown carries on and air traffic controllers continue to miss work.Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the controllers are being used as political pawns in the political standoff.\"We know the problems are going to get worse. They're going to increase, and anything that helps improve safety, we 100% stand by ensuring the safety of the American flying public,\" he told CNN.Daniels said air traffic controllers are going to continue to show up and \"do the job\".\"We are going to do everything we can, but what we can't do is somehow, suddenly put money in our own pocket,\" he said. \"We need Congress to open the government.\"Beyond air travel, the shutdown has caused unprecedented disruptions across the country, including a pause in funding for food aide programmes.Long lines fill US airportsStressed travellers and cancel messages lit up flight status boards on Friday as the emergency order took effect. As the mandate upended domestic air travel, several airlines began issuing advice for customers. Many carriers - including Delta, United and American Airlines - offered re-booking or change-fee waivers or full refunds, even to those whose flights were not impacted.Joe Sullivan said he was already in an Uber to Reagan National Airport in Washington DC when he received the notification that his flight to Atlanta, Georgia, was cancelled. He was on his way to his cousin's wedding.That city's airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, is often cited among the world's busiest and is a hub for Delta Airlines. It was one of the 40 airports that the US government selected to reduce flights. \"I ended up getting rebooked, but not until a flight that's more than 12 hours later the next day,\" Mr Sullivan said. He thinks he might still be able to make it to the wedding, landing two hours before the ceremony begins. Other planned activities, though, he will miss. \"I was hoping to catch up with family down there tonight so [it's] a huge inconvenience in that regard,\" he added. \"All I can do is just go home and just sit on the couch and wait for my flight to take off tomorrow.\"Some at the airport were plotting other ways to get to their destinations. One woman told the BBC she bought a $300 train ticket - a trip that will take seven hours - in case her hour-long flight is cancelled. Fellow traveller Ndenisarya Meekins told the BBC that she had to rebook her flight due to her planned trip to New York getting cancelled. \"We have a lot of plans in New York, so it would have been a little bit of a catastrophe if we weren't able to make it up,\" she said.Ms Meekins said travelling at this time feels \"nerve-wracking\" because of the air traffic controller shortage.\"We're trusting that we have what we need to be safe,\" she said. \"You think about these folks that have been working also without pay. We're going to go through security right now, and these are TSA agents who have been going through this process without pay and your heart goes out to them.\"For Ariana Jakovljevic, the shutdown-induced travel panic is only one part of the funding gridlock's impact on her life. She is a federal worker who has not been paid because of the shutdown.\"I just graduated college. This is my first real job. I thought I had the golden ticket. I keep hoping stuff will get taken care of,\" she said.With air traffic controllers already stretched thin by pre-existing staff shortages,  traveller Ben Sauceda said working without pay is not ideal.\"I'm entrusting my life, every time I'm flying, with air traffic controllers,\" Mr Sauceda said. \"They're phenomenal … but right now I'm putting [my life] into the hands of people who aren't getting paid, and that puts a stress on them; when they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.\"We're asking them to be top notch, to protect us,\" he added. \"The stresses that are put on them are incredibly hard. \"The government needs to figure this out.\"Getty ImagesWhen will the shutdown end? It remains unclear when the 38-day shutdown will come to an end - but there has been movement on Capitol Hill with members of Congress. For the first few weeks of the shutdown, there were few, if any, negotiations happening between Republicans and Democrats.Now, conversations are happening and both sides seem to think a deal could come to fruition. On Friday, Democrats offered a potential funding bill. The chances of it passing are slim, though, because it does not have Republican support. A total of 60 votes are needed in the Senate to pass a funding measure and the chamber is split with 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats. Since the shutdown began, members of the Republican-controlled US Senate have repeatedly voted - to no avail - in favour of the same short-term funding bill to reopen the government with no luck.Democrats have refused to support the short-term measure on government funding unless Republicans agree to extend healthcare subsidies for low-income Americans. Republicans have resisted, accusing Democrats of holding the government hostage over unrelated policy priorities.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, the chamber's top Republican, told reporters on Friday that work would continue over the weekend to come to a deal. He said senators were instructed to stay in town in case there was legislation to vote on. The House of Representatives has been out of session since the start of the shutdown.In recent days, President Donald Trump has started suggesting the shutdown could end by doing away with the Senate's filibuster - a long-standing rule that only requires 60 of the 100 members to approve most legislation. Removing the rule would allow Republicans to pass a funding bill without Democratic support.But few senators, Democrat or Republican, support the president's proposal. That did not stop Trump from pushing for the end of the filibuster again on Friday. \"The United States Senate should not leave town until they have a Deal to end the Democrat Shutdown. If they can't reach a Deal, the Republicans should terminate the Filibuster, IMMEDIATELY, and take care of our Great American Workers,\" he wrote on Truth Social. ",

Adam and Chris discuss whether this will help with government’s pledge to end the use of asylum hotels by 2029.\nAnd, there are fears of mass killings as Sudan’s civil war appears to have reached a significant turning point. More than 150,000 people have died in the conflict across the country, and about 14 million have fled their homes.

Will Kamala Harris (and Donald Trump) run for president again?AmericastAvailable for over a yearIt’s just over a year since the 2024 presidential election but attention is already turning to 2028 with both candidates from last year’s race expressing a desire to run again. Kamala Harris told the BBC over the weekend that she “wasn’t done” with public service, while Donald Trump said on Monday morning that he’d “love” to stand again for a third term. We answer your questions on whether Donald Trump plans to override the constitution for a third term in office, and whether he’d have support of the American public.\nMeanwhile, the president is back in construction, this time building a new ballroom at the White House, which has involved demolishing the 103-year-old East Wing in the process. We answer your questions on whether Trump is allowed to demolish parts of the White House and who’s actually paying for the changes. \nAnd, after Kamala Harris’s interview with the BBC, Justin and Anthony take a bit of time off air to chat through some of the issues she spoke about with Laura Kuenssberg and the circumstances surrounding Joe Biden’s eventual decision to withdraw from the election. \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "24 minutes agoLana LamSydneyGetty ImagesA 17-year-old boy has died in Melbourne after being hit by a cricket ballAn Australian teenager has died after he was hit by a cricket ball during a practice session in Melbourne.Ben Austin, 17, was training in cricket nets in Ferntree Gully on Tuesday when he was struck in the head or neck by a ball from an automatic bowling machine. It's believed he was wearing a helmet.Emergency workers were called to the scene shortly before 17:00 local time (06:00 GMT) and the boy was rushed to Monash Children's Hospital in critical condition. He was put on life support but died on Wednesday.The Ferntree Gully Cricket Club said it was \"absolutely devastated\" by the \"tragic passing\" of one its players and the teenager's death \"will be felt by all in our cricket community\".Ferntree Gully and District Cricket Association president Arnie Walters said Ben was \"both talented and popular in local cricket\".\"I know how heavily this news will land across our community and we will provide any and all support we can to our clubs and cricket family,\" he said.In a social media post, Ben's cricket club extended their condolences to his family and friends and \"to all of those who knew Ben and the joy that he brought\".\"We ask you to please respect the privacy of Ben's family during this time,\" the post said.On behalf of the teenager's family, the club also thanked Ambulance Victoria, the police and hospital staff.The BBC has contacted Cricket Australia and Cricket Victoria for comment.The incident comes just over a decade after Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014.His death, for which a coroner ultimately found no-one was to blame, sparked improvements to safety equipment for those playing the sport.",

Police were called to reports that three people had been stabbed on Monday at 17:00 GMT and paramedics treated three victims for stab wounds. A 45-year-old man is being treated in hospital with life-changing injuries, and a 14-year-old boy has been discharged from hospital after the incident. Mr Dawood was not known to Mr Broadhurst, but was known to the other two alleged victims, the Metropolitan Police said.He required hospital treatment after \"suffering a medical episode\" and was later returned to police custody where he remained, the force added.One neighbour said Mr Broadhurst was a binman who was \"just doing the normal dog walk that he does every day\".On Wednesday, Katarina Pohancenikova, managing director of Greener Ealing Ltd, confirmed that Mr Broadhurst, who was killed in the attack, was a bin man at Greener Ealing.\"Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Wayne's family, friends, and colleagues during this incredibly difficult time,\" she said.\"This is a devastating loss. Wayne was a well-respected and dedicated member of our team who made a real contribution to the work we do and to the residents we serve.\"We ask for the privacy of Wayne's loved ones to be respected as they come to terms with this appalling news.\"The Home Office confirmed the suspect entered the UK in a lorry in November 2020, was granted asylum and leave to remain in 2022, and does not live in Home Office accommodation.He also faces a charge of possession of an offensive weapon and  will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday.",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and Anna Holligan,Hague correspondent in LeidenROBIN UTRECHT/ANP/AFPRob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesThe centrist liberals under Rob Jetten are heading for a dramatic victory, according to the main exit poll, two years after his party languished in fifth place in the last vote.Jetten staged a remarkable campaign in recent weeks, and the Ipsos I&O exit poll suggests his D66 liberals have won 27 seats, two more than anti-Islam populist Geert Wilders who won the last election.Although the final result is too close to call, Wilders conceded victory and Jetten told supporters \"millions of Dutch people have turned a page; they've said goodbye to a politics of negativity\".Three other parties are close behind, including the conservative liberals, the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.Jetten's party, meanwhile, staged a highly successful campaign. Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 on just 12 seats, but the photogenic, 38-year-old leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.Jetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, because the margin of error in the exit poll meant nothing was certain.However, the conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and a likely place in a future Jetten-led coalition.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesGoing into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party had won 37 seats in November 2023, but this time the electorate were clearly put off by the realisation that he could not form another coalition.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour(PvdA)-GreenLeft of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative liberals and a revitalised Christian Democrat CDA.The exit poll spelt bad news for Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. A second exit poll, half an hour after voting ended at 21:30 (20:30 GMT) confirmed the initial projection and the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"One potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 19. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "The French parliament has ratified an amendment to add consent to the legal definition of sexual assault and rape law.Previously, rape or sexual abuse in France had been defined as \"any form of sexual penetration committed with the use of violence, coercion, threat or surprise\".Now, the law will say that all sexual acts done to another without consent constitute rape.The change is the result of a cross-party, years-long debate which gained renewed urgency after last year's Pelicot rape trial, in which 50 men were found guilty of raping Gisèle Pelicot while she had been drugged unconscious by her husband Dominique.The defence of many of the accused hinged on the fact they could not be guilty of rape because they were unaware Ms Pelicot was not in a position to give her consent.Some defence lawyers in the Pelicot case had therefore argued that there could be no crime without the intention to commit it.The new bill will make this argument more tenuous, as it says that consent must be \"free and informed, specific, prior and revocable\",The law now says consent will have to be evaluated according to the circumstances, noting that it cannot be inferred from \"silence or lack of reaction\".\"There is no consent if the sexual act is committed through violence, coercion, threat or surprise, whatever their nature,\" it states.The two MPs who drafted the amendment - the Greens' Marie-Charlotte Garin and centrist Véronique Riotton - said a \"historic victory\" had been achieved and hailed \"a major step forward in the fight against sexual violence\".Some critics of the amendment had argued it would result in sexual relations turning into \"contracts\". Others were concerned that the changes could force victims of rape to prove they had not consented.But France's highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d'État) said in March that it was backing the amendment, saying that it would \"clearly express... that sexual assaults infringe upon the fundamental principle of everyone's personal and sexual freedom\".An initial version was adopted by the National Assembly in April. Its progression was delayed by France's current political turmoil, but on Wednesday the Senate definitively adopted the bill, with 327 votes in favour and 15 abstentions. It then went back to parliament, which gave it final approval.Last year Greens senator Mélanie Vogel argued that while society had \"already accepted the fact that the difference between sex and rape is consent\" but that criminal law had not kept up.\"This is a historic step forward, following in the footsteps of several other European countries,\" Lola Schulmann, advocacy officer at Amnesty International France, told AFP on Wednesday.Sweden, Germany and Spain are among the European countries that already have consent-based rape laws.",

    "body": "Two men arrested in connection with the Louvre theft two weeks ago have \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the brazen heist, according to officials.The pair in custody are suspected of being the two who used power tools to enter the museum's Apollon gallery and steal some of the French crown jewels.Items worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October, when four thieves broke into the building in broad daylight.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that the jewels had not been recovered yet, and the gang involved could be bigger than the four people caught on CCTV.The two men, both in their thirties, have criminal records and were identified by DNA found during investigations, Beccuau said.One of the men was arrested as he tried to board a one-way flight to Algeria, but Beccuau said the other man had not been planning to leave France, despite earlier media reports.There was no evidence currently to suggest the theft was an inside job confirming no accomplices worked at the museum, she added.But Beccuau said she was not ruling out the possibility that this involved more than the four suspects caught on CCTV, including the people expecting to receive the stolen jewels.\"I want to remain hopeful that [the jewels] will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation\", she said.A crown that once belonged to Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, was dropped by the thieves as they fled. Damage to the crown is still being assessed, Beccuau added.On Sunday when the arrests were made, the prosecutor criticised the \"premature disclosure\" of information related to the case, adding that it hindered efforts to recover the jewels and find the thieves.On the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30 (08:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Beccuau said at Wednesday's conference.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.She said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars and heading east.Nobody had been threatened during the raid, she told reporters.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist. They will now be stored in the Bank's most secure vault, 26m (85ft) below the ground floor of its elegant headquarters in central Paris.",

    "body": "60 minutes agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesNearly 200,000 people on benefits could have their debts to their energy supplier cancelled, if they make some effort to pay what is owed.Unpaid bills and fees have soared in recent years with energy prices so high, leaving a record £4.4bn owed to suppliers.Up to £500m could be knocked off the total under plans that regulator Ofgem wants to take effect early next year.But that will also require the cost to be covered through an extra £5 added to everyone's gas and electricity bill. Households on a price cap tariff already typically pay £52 a year to deal with historic debt as part of the £1,755 annual bill.Under the plans:Anyone on means-tested benefits, who built up energy debt of more than £100 between April 2022 and March 2024, will be eligible for help to write it off. Suppliers would identify these customersThey would need to make some contribution to paying off the debt or covering the cost of their ongoing energy use If they are unable to pay, they would need to accept help from a debt charity to help manage their financesEnergy debt and arrears in England, Wales and Scotland rose by £750m in a year to £4.4bn, the latest Ofgem data shows.The figures, which cover the period from April to June, show that a record high of more than one million households have no arrangement to repay their debt.The regulator has been working on various projects to bring down the debt, starting early next year following consultation.However, by recovering or cancelling up to £500m, the first phase may only reduce the rate of increase in customer debt, rather than reverse it.On Wednesday, a committee of MPs said this debt should be cleared using energy network companies \"excess\" profits.In a report, the Energy Security and Net Zero (ESNZ) Committee called it \"completely inexcusable\" that households were forced to choose between eating and heating while companies behind Britain's gas pipes and power lines amassed huge profits. It said these profits should fund a debt relief scheme.Those windfall profits were partly the result of high inflation, but Ofgem said that renegotiating price controls would bring extra costs to consumers that would outweigh the benefits.Charlotte Friel, from Ofgem, said the growing amount of energy debt was a \"significant challenge\" for those in debt as well as for households that face higher bills to cover debt that can't be recovered. She said it also meant the industry was less able to invest because of the costs of debt.Ned Hammond, from Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said the scheme was an \"important first step\" but would need to be expanded to meaningfully address the debt problem and reach a wider group of customers. Charities said the move was long overdue, as families were still facing high energy bills, although some campaigners believe the industry should pay.Move in, sign upAmong the other schemes to tackle debt being considered by Ofgem is a requirement on new tenants and homeowners to ensure they are paying for their gas and electricity supply.It said that when someone moves into a new home, energy accounts were switched to the \"occupier\". Bills built up under these anonymous accounts until the individual contacted a supplier to register.Suppliers estimate this accounted for £1.1bn to £1.7bn of the historic debt in the system, which was in danger of never being paid.Ofgem wants a system similar to that used in other countries, where customers must sign up.In practical terms, to avoid customers being cut off entirely, smart meters in these properties would be switched to prepayment mode and have some available credit. This would leave residents eventually having to top-up or sign up to the supplier.The regulator's plans would only cover properties where a smart meter had been fitted.Ofgem said such schemes could eventually help bring down debt, protect vulnerable people and ease the cost burden on other billpayers.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterNvidia has hit a new milestone, becoming the first company in the world to reach a market value of $5tn (£3.8tn).The US chip giant has rapidly climbed from a niche graphics-chip designer to an AI titan, as euphoria about the potential of artificial intelligence keeps driving demand for its chips and propelling its stock to record highs.The company reached a market value of $1tn for the first time in June 2023 and hit the $4tn valuation mark just three months ago.Shares in the chip-maker rose as much as 5.6% to more than $212 on Wednesday morning, boosted by investor optimism about Nvidia's sales in China, which has been a geopolitical flashpoint.The world's most valuable company - the biggest winner in the AI spending spree - has soared past its rivals in the technology sector. It has struck deals with leading AI companies including OpenAI and Oracle as its chips continue to power the AI boom.Nvidia's value now exceeds the GDP of every country except the US and China, according to data from the World Bank, and is higher than entire sectors of the S&P 500.Microsoft and Apple have also recently crossed the $4tn valuation mark, reinforcing a broader tech rally fuelled by optimism on Wall Street about AI spending.AI-related enterprises have accounted for 80% of the stunning gains in the American stock market this year.But concerns about an AI bubble - and whether these companies are overvalued - continue to mount as tech stocks hit record after record.Warnings have come from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund, as well as from JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon, who told the BBC that \"the level of uncertainty should be higher in most people's minds\".Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, called Nvidia's $5tn valuation \"a sum so vast the human brain can't properly get a handle on it\".\"Of course, this is going to do nothing to dispel fears over an AI bubble, but the market seems keen to march on regardless,\" she added.Some sceptics are now publicly asking whether the rapid rise in the value of AI tech companies may be, at least in part, the result of what they call \"financial engineering\". Leading AI firms have been investing in one another, creating a tangled web of deals that has been drawing scrutiny. For example, OpenAI, which brought AI into the consumer mainstream with ChatGPT in 2022, last month secured a $100bn investment from Nvidia.Nvidia's share price dipped in April when global markets were jolted by US President Donald Trump's intensifying trade wars. Concerns about Trump's trade policies linger, but Nvidia's stock has still seen strong growth since the spring.It share price has risen more than 50% so far this year.Investors have been focused on Nvidia's access to China, which is the biggest market for its products and has been investing heavily to produce its own high-end chips. Nvidia had previously been banned from selling its most advanced chips to China, before Trump reversed the ban in July. Nvidia has to pay 15% of its Chinese revenues to the US government in an unprecedented deal struck in the summer.Trump, who is expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, said on Wednesday that the two leaders will discuss Nvidia's Blackwell artificial intelligence processors. His comments helped nudge Nvidia's stock even higher.Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive who has achieved celebrity status amid the company's meteoric rise, announced a flurry of partnerships on Tuesday. He said he expects $500 billion in AI chip orders through next year.",

Selective licences are required by some local councils, and are not a nationwide scheme in England.The licences require landlords to meet set standards - normally aimed at raising housing quality, fighting crime and boosting housing demand.Reeves' allies admit she should have got a licence, but claim she was specifically told by the estate agents at the time that they would advise if she needed a licence.The council's website states: \"You can be prosecuted or fined if you're a landlord or managing agent for a property that needs a licence and do not get one.\"A spokesperson for Rachel Reeves said: \"Since becoming chancellor Rachel Reeves has rented out her family home through a lettings agency. \"She had not been made aware of the licencing requirement, but as soon as it was brought to her attention she took immediate action and has applied for the licence.\"This was an inadvertent mistake and in the spirit of transparency she has made the prime minister, the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Standards and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards aware.\"Reeves or her letting agent now face an unlimited fine if Southwark Council takes the matter to court. The revelations come at a politically awkward time for Reeves, who is preparing for a Budget at the end of the month amidst speculation the government could break a manifesto commitment not to raise income tax.Writing on social media, Badenoch said Sir Keir \"once said 'lawmakers can't be lawbreakers'. If, as it appears, the chancellor has broken the law, then he will have to show he has the backbone to act.\"The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"The chancellor is meant to be delivering growth but the only thing she appears to be growing is the government's list of scandals.\"Just weeks before the Budget, this risks seriously undermining confidence in this government and its ability to focus on the urgent tasks at hand.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoLucy Fleming and Richard KagoeThe Rapid Support Forces militia reportedly killed hundreds of civilians at the main hospital in el-Fasher, days after it captured the Sudanese city, the head of the UN's health agency says.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN health agency was \"appalled and deeply shocked\" by the reported killing of 460 people at the hospital.Earlier, the Sudan Doctors' Network said that on Tuesday RSF fighters had \"cold bloodedly killed everyone they found inside the Saudi Hospital, including patients, their companions, and anyone else present\".It gave no casualty figures, but said medical facilities in the city had been \"transformed into human slaughterhouses\".The Sudan Doctors Network has also accused the RSF of kidnapping six medics - including four doctors, a pharmacist and a nurse - and reportedly demanding ransoms in excess of $150,000 (£114,000) for their release.Tuesday's attack on Saudi Hospital was also reported by the el-Fasher Resistance Committee, a group of local activists, which said there was \"a horrifying silence\" afterwards.The city had been the army's last stronghold in the Darfur region, and was captured by the RSF on Sunday after an 18-month siege marked by starvation and heavy bombardment.New videos show executions after RSF militia takes key Sudan cityA simple guide to what is happening in SudanA pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneSince the conflict erupted in April 2023, the RSF and allied Arab militia in Darfur have been accused of targeting people from non-Arab ethnic groups - allegations the RSF denies.With the fall of el-Fasher, the UN, activists and aid agencies have expressed fear over the fate of the estimated 250,000 people trapped in the city, many from non-Arab communities.A communications blackout has made it difficult to confirm what is happening.BBC Verify has analysed new videos posted to social media showing RSF fighters executing a number of unarmed people in the last few days.With the difficulties in getting reports from the ground, aid agencies say the full scale of the devastation in and around el-Fasher is only beginning to emerge.Some people have managed to make the dangerous journey to the town of Tawila, about 60km (37 miles) west of el-Fasher, and described the extreme violence they faced.\"The shelling was so intense on Saturday that we had no choice but to flee el-Fashir,\" one man told BBC Arabic's Sudan Lifeline programme.\"Along the way, the RSF filmed us and we were beaten and insulted - and they stole what we had on the journey. A number of people were captured and ransoms were demanded for their release.\"Some of those who were taken were later executed. During the journey, many people were arrested, and we suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.\"Jan Egeland, a former top UN humanitarian official, told the BBC the situation was catastrophic.\"We have had massacres on top on all of those months of deprivation, starvation, no medical care,\" he said.\"I think this is the worst place on Earth now; it's the biggest humanitarian emergency on Earth and it happens in the dark, really - there has been far too little attention to what's happening in Sudan.\"Dr Tedros said prior to the Saudi Hospital attack, the WHO had verified 185 attacks on health care facilities since the start of the war, resulting in 1,204 deaths.\"All attacks on health care must stop immediately and unconditionally. All patients, health personnel and health facilities must be protected under international humanitarian law. Ceasefire!\" he said.The capture of el-Fasher effectively splits the country, with the RSF now in control of most of Darfur and much of neighbouring Kordofan and the army holding the capital, Khartoum, central and eastern regions along the Red Sea.The two warring rivals had been allies - coming to power together in a coup in 2021 - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule.",

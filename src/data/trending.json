    "body": "The Metropolitan Police has said it will \"take no further action\" over claims Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked his police protection officer for information on accuser Virginia Giuffre.The allegations, first reported in the Mail on Sunday in October, said the then-prince gave the officer Ms Giuffre's date of birth and social security number, just before the paper published a photo of the pair meeting in February 2011.On Saturday, the Met said a further assessment \"has not revealed any additional evidence of criminal acts or misconduct\".Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has not commented on the reports, but has consistently denied all allegations against him.A spokesperson for the police force said: \"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter.\"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action.\"As with any other matter, should new and relevant information be brought to our attention, including in any information resulting from the release of material in the US, we will assess it.\"Ms Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were \"deeply disappointed\" by the decision to drop the investigation \"without explanation and without speaking to us\".They added: \"With the Epstein files about to be released by Congress since the passage of the Epstein Transparency Act, we are surprised that the Metropolitan Police didn't wait to see what further evidence might appear.\"While we have hailed the UK's overall handling of the case of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor previously, today we feel justice has not been served.\"Ms Giuffre said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.She claimed she was forced to have sex with the then-Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend - he died in a New York police cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.In her memoir, published posthumously, Ms Giuffre described her allegations against the former prince in detail.She alleged the third time she had sex with Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was on Epstein's island, as part of what she called \"an orgy\".She also recalled seeing a picture of Epstein and the former prince together in New York in 2011, saying she was \"revolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll\" but \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein\".In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor said he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\", and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"He reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, formally ending a civil sex assault case against him in the US.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor has faced years of scrutiny over his past relationship with Epstein. He has always denied allegations of wrongdoing related to Epstein.Earlier this year he was stripped of his title as prince following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the convicted sex offender. He had previously given up his other royal titles - including the Duke of York.He is also due to leave his mansion in Windsor, the Royal Lodge, by next October. It's expected he will move to Sandringham, in Norfolk, early next year.On Friday, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor was one of a number of high-profile figures to feature in photographs released by Democrats, showcasing Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful.Epstein was associated with many well-known figures, and merely being named in files related to the disgraced financier is not an indication of wrongdoing by any of the parties mentioned.A cropped section of a picture showing the former prince talking to Microsoft founder Bill Gates was included in the latest batch of photographs.It was a cropped version of an image taken by a photographer working for Getty Images in 2018, with the original version showing them in conversation with King Charles.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSarah Rainsford,VilniusandDearbail JordanBelarus has freed 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, after the US agreed to lift sanctions on the Eastern European country.Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is also among those who have been freed following talks in Minsk with US President Donald Trump's special envoy for Belarus, John Coale.The US has agreed to lift sanctions on potash, a key ingredient in fertiliser and an important export for Belarus, which is a close ally of Russia. Coale said: \"As relations between the two countries normalise, more and more sanctions will be lifted.\"Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, is not recognised as president by the EU. Kolesnikova has been in prison since 2020, much of the time in isolation.Her sister, Tatiana Khomich, who campaigned tirelessly for her release was able to speak to her by video call soon after and confirmed the news to the BBC.\"She is free, she looks fine, she looks good,\" said Khomich, who said she was looking forward to giving her sibling a hug.  A group of those released are expected in Lithuania's capital Vilnius shortly. A crowd is gathering outside the US embassy.Khomich said the first thing Kolesnikova said when they spoke was \"thank you to the US administration, President Trump [and] to the Belarus government as well for leading and talking and having these negotiations\".The deal is a major achievement for Lukashenko and the authoritarian leader will also welcome how the Americans have ended his international isolation.As well as the EU, the US did not recognise Lukashenko as president following unfair elections five years ago which led to mass street protests that were brutally suppressed by police.Hundreds of people were arrested then – including Kolesnikova - and the intense political repression has continued.Western sanctions were tightened following Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when troops entered via Belarus and missiles were launched from its territory.Coale was quoted by Belarusian state media saying that the sanctions on potash would be lifted immediately,The US envoy also said he spoke to Lukashenko about Ukraine and what help Minsk could offer in talks with Putin.The attempt to engage with Minsk is part of a major shift in US policy, which leaves it very much at odds with Europe – where the approach is to sanction and isolate.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandMatt SpiveyCambodia has shut its border crossings with Thailand, as fighting continues between the two forces on Saturday despite US President Donald Trump earlier saying they had agreed to a ceasefire.The crossings will be closed until further notice, according to Cambodia's interior ministry.Earlier, Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said he told Trump a ceasefire would only be possible after Cambodia had withdrawn all its forces and removed landmines.Thai officials said four soldiers were killed on Saturday, as both sides reported continued bombing and artillery exchanges. Cambodia has not been updating its military casualty figure.Cambodia's defence ministry said that Thai fighter jets bombed hotel buildings and a bridge, while Thailand reported several civilians were injured in a Cambodian rocket attack.The four deaths on Saturday bring Thailand's total military death toll since Monday to 15, with 270 others injured. It added that six civilians had also been injured.On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.Since then, tensions continued to build.This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurandIlma HasanWatch: Anger and chaos in Salt Lake stadium, Kolkata as Messi leaves event earlyAngry fans attending Lionel Messi's tour of India ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch after his appearance at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium.Thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a glimpse of the football star, but were left disappointed when he emerged to walk around the pitch, and was obscured by a large group of officials and celebrities.When the Argentina and Inter Miami forward was whisked away early by security after around 20 minutes, elements of the crowd turned hostile.West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.ReutersAs it became apparent Messi's appearance had ended, local media say the scene turned ugly Messi is in India for his 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour', a series of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. His tour began with the unveiling of a 70ft (21m) statue of himself in Kolkata, which had been assembled over the course of 27 days by a 45-strong crew. Messi appeared virtually due to security concerns.Thousands of fans travelled to the city's stadium for a chance to see the footballer in person.They were chanting, buying jerseys and wearing \"I love Messi\" headbands.Messi initially walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended on Saturday, some frustrated fans stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, as others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.The 2022 World Cup winner - considered one of football's greatest ever players - had been expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium, the AFP news agency reports.\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi... Why did they call us then... We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face\", a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.One angry fan told the Press Trust of India news agency people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\"I paid Rs 5,000 for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians. \"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"Messi was accompanied on his brief visit by his Inter Miami teammate and Uruguay star Luis Suarez, and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul.Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan also met Messi earlier in the day, according to the Reuters news agency.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesMessi waving to fans as he arrivedThousands of fans had gathered for the eventKolkata is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal and has a large football fanbase in an otherwise cricket-crazed country.In the city, it is common to see hundreds of thousands of fans gather at stadiums at a derby of local clubs.The BBC has contacted Lionel Messi's representatives for comment.Announcing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the incident at the stadium.\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" the chief minister said on X.A police official told reporters that the event's \"chief organiser\" had been arrested, without giving any further details, AFP reports.Authorities will look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets, the official added.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the \"private event\".In the early hours of Saturday, thousands lined the roads and congregated outside the hotel where Messi was staying to try and catch a glimpse of him.Hitesh, a 24-year-old corporate lawyer, flew nearly 1,900 kilometres from the south Indian city of Bengaluru.\"For me it's personal. You can see I am quite short, and I love to play football with my friends,\" Hitesh told the BBC, standing in front of the statue.\"Messi is the player I related with the most, no one can match his talent. He gives me hope that with talent you can do anything.\"It is just a small part of India's homage to the former Barcelona and Paris St-Germain forward.Fans can also visit a \"Hola Messi\" fan zone with a life-sized replica Messi sat on a throne, a hall adorned with some of his trophies, and a recreation of his Miami home complete with mannequins of the player and his family sat on a balcony.",

    "body": "An eyebrow tip and McDonald's footage: Takeaways from Luigi Mangione's evidence hearing 15 hours agoMadeline HalpertGetty ImagesMr Mangione has watched as the court plays body camera footage from the day of his arrestLuigi Mangione, the man accused of fatally shooting United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a case that sparked national attention, watched as new testimony and never-before-seen footage from the day of his arrest in a McDonald's was unveiled during a hearing this week.Mr Mangione has pleaded not guilty to state charges related to the 2024 murder of Mr Thompson, a father of two, as well as federal counts that carry the possibility of the death penalty.The pre-trial hearing is focused on the defence's attempts to keep certain evidence out of the trial, which has not been scheduled yet, including items found in his backpack during his arrest and statements he made to officers.During the first two weeks of the hearing, supporters of Mr Mangione - the scion of a prominent Maryland family and Ivy League graduate - filled the back rows of the Manhattan criminal courtroom, some wearing a pin portraying him as a saint-like figure.Prosecutors and Mr Mangione's legal team are expected to question over a dozen witnesses from the day of his arrest, including the employees who spotted him and the police who arrested him.Here is a look at some of the key pieces of evidence discussed that offer a window into Mr Mangione's trial.An eyebrow giveawayThe pre-trial hearing has centred on the small-town McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where officers were shocked to find the high-profile suspect days after Mr Thompson was fatally shot - and hours from the busy Midtown Manhattan crime scene.Witnesses suggested the arrest may never have occurred there if not for one of  Mr Mangione's key features: his eyebrows.During the first day of the hearing, prosecutors played a call to police from a McDonald's employee about a tip from a customer in the restaurant.The employee said the customer thought a patron looked like the suspect in the United Healthcare CEO shooting. The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".New York County District Attorney's OfficeProsecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald'sDozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.A fake name leads to an arrestWatch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald'sIn the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpackThe pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.New York County District Attorney's OfficeEvidence found during Mr Mangione's arrestVideo played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.The hearing is expected to continue into next week.",

    "body": "The British Medical Association (BMA) has warned against public \"scaremongering\" over the current flu outbreak as its members vote on whether to carry out planned strikes in England next week.It comes after Health Secretary Wes Streeting said he was \"extremely worried\" about the \"double whammy\" of rising numbers of flu patients in hospitals and forthcoming resident doctor strikes.BMA resident doctors committee chair Dr Jack Fletcher said that while the union was not \"diminishing\" the impact of flu, Streeting \"should not be scaremongering the public into thinking that the NHS will not be able to look after them.\"The result of a BMA ballot is due on Monday. If it is rejected, a five-day strike will begin on Wednesday.The government says a deal offers legislation that prioritises British medical graduates for speciality training jobs starting next year and offers to cover the costs of training expenses such as exam fees.The deal does not include a pay rise. Writing in the Guardian, Sir Keir Starmer said pay for resident doctors - the new name for junior doctors - has increased by 28.9% over the past three years.In a statement released on Saturday morning, the BMA called on the health secretary to \"focus his time and attention on offering a deal that will stop next week's strikes going ahead, rather than making claims that strike action could cause the NHS to collapse.\"The BMA has written to chief executives of NHS Trusts in England saying it recognised that, in the event of a strike, resident doctors may be required to return to work to \"maintain safe patient care\".The letter, signed by BMA council chair Dr Tom Dolphin, says: \"As doctors, we at the BMA wish to ensure that patients remain safe\".A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the secretary of state had \"listened to resident doctors' concerns and worked constructively to put forward an improved offer on the table\".Speaking to LBC earlier this week, Streeting said the current situation was \"probably the worst pressure the NHS has faced since Covid\".He questioned why the BMA hadn't taken up his offer of pushing the strike back to January \"if they wanted to just give me a kicking\".\"I can only assume that the reason why they refuse to do that is because they know that this week will be most painful for the NHS,\" he added.Echoing the health secretary, the prime minister said the \"reckless\" strikes \"should not happen\" while the NHS is facing its \"most precarious moment since the pandemic\".Sir Keir wrote in the Guardian on Friday that the BMA had been sent a new offer as well as a chance to reschedule the strikes until after Christmas.\"Don't get me wrong – of course I would rather they were cancelled... But under the circumstances, I wanted to be sure we have left no stone unturned in our efforts to protect the NHS,\" he said.The BMA said it will ask its members whether the government's offer will be enough to call off Wednesday's strikes.If members indicate yes, then they will be given time to consider the offer in more detail and a formal follow-up referendum would be held on ending the dispute completely.Some experts say flu has come early this winter, and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating.Many are calling it \"super flu\", but it is not more severe nor harder to treat.An average of 2,660 patients per day were in hospital with flu in England last week – the highest for this time of the year since records began in 2021, and up 55% on the week before, NHS England said.It is important to note that the records only date back to 2021 and so do not capture the two worst flu seasons of the past 15 years, which were seen in 2014-15 and 2017-18.Flu cases are also rising in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, figures show.However, the medical director for the NHS in London, Chris Streather, said the flu situation was \"well within the boundaries\" of what the NHS could cope with and that hospitals were better prepared for large disease outbreaks since the Covid pandemic.Speculation is probably not helpful and can cause people to worry, he added.",

Both men, aged in their 20s, were arrested after an appeal by Peterlee Neighbourhood Police Team. Shotton Residents Association chairman Steve Maitland said he was \"devastated\", adding that the green spruce had been put up about 11 years ago in memory of locals who served in World War One.Police said officers were in the process of charging and remanding a 26-year-old man with criminal damage, while a 23-year-old man has been released under investigation.Sam Hotson/BBCThe tree, in the village of Shotton Colliery, was cut down on WednesdayMr Maitland told BBC Look North: \"I thought it was a hoax initially but when I couldn't see the tree I was absolutely gutted.\"He said a sleeve has been wrapped around its base, so it could be bolted back up as quickly as possible \"just to tide us over for Christmas\".Describing the community response as \"tremendous\", he said people were offering to raise money for a new tree.\"These people who did this - I don't think they understand the history and the feeling of these things,\" he said.Some of those involved in fundraising for the original tree a decade ago had since died, he said.Durham PoliceThe tree had been in the village for more than 10 years Mr Maitland called the attack \"mindless vandalism\" but said he could not \"turn the clock back\".\"It's been horrendous - it's touched every person in the village,\" he said.He added that \"hopefully by spring\" a new tree could be planted.Durham County Council's Reform UK leader Andrew Husband, writing on social media, described those responsible as \"scumbags\".\"Disgraceful and not fair on the locals in Shotton,\" he said.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "As Trump targets Venezuela, its allies Russia and China show little signs of support16 hours agoNorberto ParedesBBC News MundoGetty ImagesVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro could be forgiven for wondering who his true friends are. Once rock solid, his reliance on his two main allies - China and Russia - now appears increasingly uncertain.For years, both countries supported Venezuela's socialist-led government politically, financially and militarily - a relationship that began under former President Hugo Chávez, Maduro's mentor and predecessor.But experts say that backing now seems to be largely symbolic, with statements being given in support rather than concrete military or financial aid.This shift comes as the US has deployed air and naval forces - including a nuclear-powered submarine, spy planes and 15,000 troops - to the Caribbean.The US has conducted strikes on boats in the region that it alleges are smuggling drugs, killing more than 80 people, and in recent days, it seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela.The Trump administration has said the military build-up and strikes are targeting drug trafficking, and the tanker had been sanctioned. But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.Getty ImagesPutin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025. Russia has provided Venezuela with military support for yearsLike Moscow, Beijing has shown no sign it would militarily defend Venezuela, instead condemning what it calls \"external interference\" and urging restraint.Experts say China defending Maduro could jeopardise recent diplomatic gains between Beijing and Washington, while offering little beyond ideological alignment.US–China relations have been particularly tense since Trump imposed tariffs on multiple countries. But a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping in South Korea in late October - described as positive by both sides - opened the door to new agreements and lower tariffs on certain products.According to experts, Venezuela's economic collapse and the deterioration of its oil industry have further discouraged Chinese support. Beijing has reduced new lending in recent years and is now focused mainly on recovering past loans.\"I think China is willing to negotiate with any government that eventually replaces Maduro, and believes that supporting Maduro too strongly now could bring negative consequences when the regime falls,\" says Prof Rouvinski.Getty ImagesVenezuela has purchased hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of Chinese military equipment since 2005Prof Reyes Matta does not think \"either of the two countries is willing to support a regime that has so little internal backing\".\"Moreover, both Russia and China know that the last presidential election had very evident fraudulent characteristics.\"The July 2024 election was marred by serious allegations of fraud. The National Electoral Council (CNE), dominated by government allies, proclaimed Maduro the winner but provided no detailed results, unlike in previous elections.The opposition - led by this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado - released electoral records suggesting the opposition candidate Edmundo González won.\"This time, Maduro is completely alone,\" says Prof Rouvinski, who believes Maduro's time is \"running out\". \"Russia and China may continue criticising US intervention, but they are not willing to go any further. The support he had in the past is no longer there in real terms, beyond certain rhetorical statements.\"Additional reporting by BBC Global Journalism ",

    "body": "One million households without power in Ukraine after Russia attacks energy grid4 hours agoState Emergency Service Of UkraineA firefighter works at the site of a Russian strike in OdesaMore than a million households are without electricity in Ukraine after a barrage of overnight Russian strikes hit energy and industrial infrastructure, officials said.Ukraine's internal affairs minister, Ihor Klymenko, said five regions were hit and at least five people were injured, and work was under way to extinguish fires and restore supplies.While Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have been common throughout the war, Moscow has intensified strikes as the country heads into winter.It comes as US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy will travel to Germany this weekend to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders for more talks on ending the war.Steve Witkoff, who has been leading White House attempts to mediate between Ukraine and Russia, will discuss the latest version of the proposed peace agreement in Berlin.On Saturday, Zelensky said more than 450 drones and 30 missiles were used by Russia in overnight strikes. Klymenko said the Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Chernihiv regions were hit.Russia's defence ministry said it used weapons including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes - which are hard to track as they can change direction mid-flight.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all offsite power overnight \"due to widespread military activities affecting the electrical grid\", but is now reconnected. The plant is in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. It is not operating, but relies on a constant power supply to cool its reactors.In Russia, regional governor Roman Busargin said two people were killed in Saratov after a drone strike hit a residential building.The Trump administration is pushing for a deal to end the war to be in place by Christmas and has held several rounds of talks with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in recent weeks, though there has been little sign a breakthrough is imminent. It has not yet been confirmed which European leaders will attend the Berlin talks.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported details of the meeting, said UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would all take part. The Witkoff-Zelensky meeting comes after Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, the latest iteration of a proposal which first emerged in late November and has triggered a flurry of diplomatic activity.The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.Zelensky has reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.\"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" said Zelensky.In public, Ukraine and its allies in Europe have described the US-led talks as fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged. But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.In a scathing interview with Politico earlier this week, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.On Friday, EU nations agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets held in Europe. It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder. Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosWatch: King Charles issues update on his cancer treatmentKing Charles has been praised for his candour in talking about his cancer treatment where he highlighted the importance of early detection and screening.In a recorded video message, broadcast on Channel 4 for the Stand Up To Cancer campaign, the King said his treatment was being reduced and he urged people to take up offers of cancer screening, saying \"early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.\"The type of cancer he is being treated for has not been revealed and the King, 77, will continue to receive treatment and monitoring.Clare Garnsey, associate medical director of Greater Manchester Cancer Alliance, said his message was \"very powerful\".The King, who revealed his diagnosis in February last year, is not described as being in remission or \"cured\" but the regularity of his treatment will be significantly reduced in the new year.In his video message, recorded in Clarence House two weeks ago, he said that he was \"troubled\" to learn that nine million people around the UK are not up to date with the cancer screening available to them.\"That is at least nine million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he said.He added: \"Too often, I am told, people avoid screening because they imagine it may be frightening, embarrassing or uncomfortable.\"If and when they do finally take up their invitation, they are glad they took part.\"A few moments of minor inconvenience are a small price to pay for the reassurance that comes for most people when they are either told either they don't need further tests or, for some, are given the chance to enable early detection, with the life-saving intervention that can follow.\"PA MediaThe King attended a service at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday as he keeps a busy schedule despite receiving weekly treatmentSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Miss Garnsey said she, \"like the majority of health professionals who work in the cancer field\" was \"really thankful\" for what the King said.\"I think the message was very powerful about the importance of early diagnosis and how important it is that we all attend for our screening,\" she added.She said it is \"really helpful\" to healthcare professionals when people in \"positions of influence\" - such as the King - speak publicly about their experiences with cancer.These messages highlight that it \"can happen to anybody\", she said, and raise awareness of the potential symptoms someone may experience.Royal biographer and friend of King Charles, Jonathan Dimbleby, said the King's message demonstrated the \"unique role of the sovereign\".Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the King's decision to speak openly about his treatment in such \"warm, gentle, thoughtful, kind terms\" was \"quite extraordinary and it has great impact\".He said the King's message will give people \"great reassurance\" to hear of someone who \"has a cancer and lives with that cancer\".\"It makes you recognise [...] that it's not a death sentence,\" he added.Dimbleby's father, broadcaster Richard Dimbleby, died at age 52 in 1965.\"When he died, he had been frightened to say, in advance to himself even, that he had cancer,\" he said, adding that the word cancer was \"hardly usable then\".He said it took \"guts\" for the King to share such a personal message publicly, but that \"the fact that he came out and did that will save lives, and people will be less frightened of saying 'we must go and get a test'.\"Dimbleby said that when it was announced that the King was having treatment for an enlarged prostate in 2024, there was a considerable surge in searches to the NHS website.\"No one else could have done this,\" he added.What can be general symptoms of cancer?Different types of cancer all have their own symptoms - but the NHS says general symptoms can include:A new lump or swellingSweating a lot or a high temperatureFeeling more tired than usualUnusual bruising or bleedingUnusual pain anywhere in the bodyUnexpected weight loss or loss of appetiteNeeding to pee more often or more urgently, or pain when you peeRead more on the NHS website.Until now the King has said little publicly about his illness.In his video message, King Charles said he knew how \"overwhelming\" a diagnosis can feel, but stressed that early detection is \"key\" to give patients the \"precious gift of hope\".The NHS has three cancer screening programmes - for bowel, breast and cervical cancer - available to certain age groups.These tests can detect a problem even before someone experiences symptoms.In his message, the King also urged people to use the screening checker online tool.Cancer charity Macmillan Cancer Support said it was \"incredibly grateful\" to the King for sharing his experience \"with such openness and honesty\".\"The King's reminder of the importance of screening and early detection is an important message for us all,\" it added in a statement.The prime minister said the King's message was \"powerful\" and that he was \"glad\" that the King's treatment will be reduced in the new year.According to Buckingham Palace, the King's recovery has reached a very positive stage and he has \"responded exceptionally well to treatment\", so much so that doctors will now move his treatment \"into a precautionary phase\".Meanwhile, Dr Harrison Carter, director of screening at NHS England, said the health service \"fully supported\" the King's call for people to attend screening tests.\"So, when your NHS screening invite arrives, whether it's for cervical or breast screening, or a bowel cancer testing kit through the post, please do make time to take it up.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoJames Gallagher,Health and science correspondentandCatherine Snowdon,Health reporterGettySome men are having vast numbers of children through sperm donation. This week the BBC reported on a man whose sperm contained a genetic mutation that dramatically raises the risk of cancer for some of his offspring. One of the most striking aspects of the investigation was that the man's sperm was sent to 14 countries and produced at least 197 children. The revelation was a rare insight into the scale of the sperm donor industry.Sperm donation allows women to become mothers when it might not otherwise be possible - if their partner is infertile, they're in a same-sex relationship, or parenting solo. Filling that need has become big business. It is estimated the market in Europe will be worth more than £2bn by 2033, with Denmark a major exporter of sperm.So why are some sperm donors fathering so many children, what made Danish or so-called \"Viking sperm\" so popular, and does the industry need to be reined in?Most men's sperm isn't good enoughIf you're a man reading this, we are sorry to break it to you, but the quality of your sperm probably isn't good enough to become a donor - fewer than five in 100 volunteers actually make the grade.First, you have to produce enough sperm in a sample - that's your sperm count - then pass checks on how well they swim - their motility - and on their shape or morphology. Sperm is also checked to ensure it can survive being frozen and stored at a sperm bank. You could be perfectly fertile, have six children, and still not be suitable.Getty ImagesRules vary across the world, but in the UK you also have to be relatively young - aged 18-45; be free of infections like HIV and gonorrhoea, and not be a carrier of mutations that can cause genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy and sickle cell disease.Overall, it means the pool of people that finally become sperm donors is small. In the UK, half the sperm ends up being imported.But biology means a small number of donors can make vast numbers of children. It takes just one sperm to fertilise an egg, but there are tens of millions of sperm in each ejaculation. Men will come to the clinic once or twice a week while they're donating, which can be for months at a time.Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust charity which works on fertility and genomics, said the donor sperm shortage made it \"a precious commodity\" and \"sperm banks and fertility clinics are maximising the use of available donors to meet demand\".Some sperm is more popularAllan PaceyProf Allan Pacey From this small pool of donors, some men's sperm is just more popular than others.Donors are not chosen at random. It's a similar process to the savage reality of dating apps, when some men get way more matches than others.Depending on the sperm bank, you can browse photos, listen to their voice, find out what job they do - engineer or artist? - and check out their height, weight and more.\"You know if they're called Sven and they've got blonde hair, and they're 6 ft 4 (1.93m) and they're an athlete, and they play the fiddle and speak seven languages - you know that's far more attractive than a donor that looks like me,\" says male fertility expert Prof Allan Pacey, pictured, who used to run a sperm bank in Sheffield.\"Ultimately, people are swiping left and swiping right when it comes to donor matching.\"How Viking sperm took over the worldGetty ImagesDenmark has become a global exporter of sperm (model not donor)Denmark is home to some of the world's biggest sperm banks, and has gained a reputation for producing \"Viking babies\".Ole Schou, the 71-year-old founder of the Cryos International sperm bank where a single 0.5ml vial of sperm costs from €100 (£88) to more than €1000 (£880), says the culture around sperm donation in Denmark is very different to other countries.\"The population is like one big family,\" he says, \"there is less taboo about these issues, and we are an altruistic population, many sperm donors also donate blood.\"Cryos InternationalOle Schou founded Cryos International in 1987And that, Schou says, has allowed the country to become \"one of the few exporters of sperm\".But he argues Danish sperm is also popular due to genetics. He told the BBC the Danish \"blue-eyed and blonde-haired genes\" are recessive traits, which means they  need to come from both parents in order to appear in a child. As a result, the mother's traits, such as dark hair, \"might be dominant in the resulting child\", Schou explains.He says demand for donor sperm is coming mainly from \"single, highly-educated, women in their 30s\". They now make up 60% of requests.Sperm crossing bordersOne aspect of the sperm donor investigation published earlier this week was how a man's sperm was collected at the European Sperm Bank in Denmark and then sent to 67 fertility clinics across 14 countries.Nations have their own rules on how many times one man's sperm can be used. Sometimes it is linked to a total number of children, others limit it to a certain number of mothers (so each family can have as many related children as they want).The original argument around those limits was to avoid half-siblings - who didn't know they were related - meeting each other, forming relationships and having children.But there's nothing to stop the same donor's sperm being used in Italy and Spain and then the Netherlands and Belgium, as long as the rules are being followed in each country.This creates circumstances where a sperm donor can legally father large numbers of children. Although the man is often in the dark about that fact.\"Many recipients, and also donors, are unaware that a single donor's sperm can be lawfully used in many different countries - this fact should be better explained,\" says Sarah Norcross, who argues it would be \"sensible\" to bring down the number of children one donor can have.GettySperm is frozen until it is needed by familiesIn response to the investigation into the sperm donor who passed on a gene that led to cancer in some of the 197 children he fathered, officials in Belgium have called on the European Commission to establish a Europe-wide sperm donor register to monitor sperm travelling across borders.Deputy prime minister Frank Vandenbroucke said the industry was like the \"Wild West\" and \"the initial mission of offering people the possibility of a family has given way to a veritable fertility business\".The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has also proposed a limit of 50 families per donor across the EU. That system would still allow one donor's sperm to make more than 100 children if the families wanted two or more babies each.GettyConcerns have been raised about the impact on the children conceived through sperm donation. Some will be happy, others can be profoundly distressed by the double discovery of being made with donor sperm and being one of hundreds of half-siblings.The same is true of donors, who often have no idea their sperm is being so widely distributed.These risks are amplified by readily available DNA ancestry tests and social media where people can search for their children, siblings or the donor. In the UK, there is no longer anonymity for sperm donors and there is an official process through which children learn the identity of their biological father. Mr Schou at Cryos argues more restrictions on sperm donation would just lead families to \"turn to the private, totally unregulated, market\".Dr John Appleby, a medical ethicist at Lancaster University, said the implications of using sperm so widely was a \"vast\" ethical minefield.He said there are issues around identity, privacy, consent, dignity and more - making it a \"balancing act\" between competing needs.Dr Appleby said the fertility industry had a \"responsibility to get a handle on the number of times a donor is used\", but agreeing global regulations would be undeniably \"very difficult\".He added that a global sperm donor register, which has been suggested, came with its own \"ethical and legal challenges\".More weekend reads",

    "body": "The making of a WWE legend: John Cena faces his final fight16 hours agoManish PandeyWWE via Getty ImagesThe Last Time Is Now. It's the name of the tournament in which 16 wrestling giants have been competing to take on John Cena in his final fight before retirement.And that final fight is now - Saturday night - in Washington DC, bringing the curtain down on an illustrious career that has seen the American become one of wrestling's biggest and most bankable stars.In the 8,570 days since his debut, Cena has clinched 17 world titles and coined the iconic \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase - but the 48-year-old's impact goes far beyond that.If you were to pose the question \"who is John Cena?\", depending on who you ask, the answers might vary from legendary WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) superstar, to successful film actor, while some will say he's Mr Make-A-Wish (more on that later).Rich Freeda/WWE via Getty ImagesJohn Cena celebrates his win during WrestleMania 41 Sunday in Las Vegas in April 2025How to watch John Cena's last match:Start time: WWE Saturday Night's Main Event is scheduled to begin at 01:00 GMT on Sun 14 DecWhere to watch: In the UK, you can watch for free on WWE's official YouTube channel. Internationally it can be watched on Netflix, and on Peacock in the US'An exceptional wrestling talent'Since his 2002 debut, there's been an evolution in his own wrestling character - transitioning from \"ruthless aggression\" rookie, to a \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" rapper, and eventually a heroic character known for a \"Never Give Up\" attitude.Despite criticism from some fans of his in-ring ability, with occasional chants of \"you can't wrestle\" through the years, \"there's no doubt that he's an exceptional wrestling talent\", says Brandon Thurston, editor and owner of wrestling website, Wrestlenomics.He feels something changed in 2005, after which WWE became \"increasingly scripted in a way it had not been\" before, as it entered into a more controlled, family friendly PG era. But Cena managed to thrive. \"He's definitely been the biggest draw over the time which I would say stretches from 2005 to roughly 2015,\" Mr Thurston says, with Cena's merchandise also regularly topping sales for the company.\"There's little question that he was WWE's most important economic wrestler throughout that time - in terms of pay-per-view buys, which were still central in that era, TV ratings, and as a house show draw.\"Outside the ring too, he's a personality who \"people gravitate towards and want to listen to\", says Mr Thurston - and wrestling fans like Joe Clarkson and Sabrina Nicole feel just that.WWE via Getty ImagesCena made his debut against Kurt Angle at SmackDown in June 2002\"To go for such a long time in an industry, which is quite heavily taxing on the body, is absolutely fascinating,\" says Joe, 24, who was five when he first saw Cena on TV.\"I think over time, the people just gained more and more respect for him, not just as a performer, but also as an individual.\"For Sabrina, 37, who remembers Cena's WWE debut in 2002, it's \"his charisma\".\"He has just always had something about him that makes him a star,\" she says, adding that for most of his career, he's \"always maintained a good guy persona\".\"No matter what the crowd, no matter what the fans have thought of him. He has just been the testament to if you have a really good character, you can be on top,\" she says.It also seems to be true that, beyond his ability and persona, Cena seized an opportunity.Getty ImagesCena's signature \"You Can't See Me\" gestureWith The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin no longer full-time performers, WWE bosses were looking for a new star to emerge.Mr Thurston feels WWE leadership recognised Cena \"would be a very reliable and extremely hardworking person whom they could entrust with such a spot\".It's widely accepted within wrestling circles that the final decision to have Cena as the chosen star would ultimately have been taken by then-WWE chairman Vince McMahon.While he was known for following his instincts, there will also have been a judgement on Cena's ability to connect with a passionate crowd on the mic, his marketability and whether he could be in the industry long enough to be profitable.And when Cena started taking more time away from wrestling in 2015 and working a reduced schedule, Mr Thurston feels there was a \"decline\" in the WWE product.Other wrestling experts have suggested Cena's presence over the years helped slow the slide of WWE ratings trending downwards which, according to analysis by wrestling site PWtorch, saw average viewership for its flagship weekly Raw programme fall by a million between 2010 and 2015, to 3.7m.Having achieved so much within wrestling, Cena could \"just come in and be a wrestler and walk out\", adds Dr Gillian Brooks, associate professor in marketing at King's Business School, but instead she says he built a personal brand that comes across as real.An 'authentic' characterAmong the brands Cena has worked with is Neutrogena, becoming the face of its sunscreen campaign after revealing he had skin cancer spots - which he attributed to his own lack of sun protection use.He also holds the Guinness World Record for the number of wishes granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, with more than 650 fulfilled wishes for children with critical illnesses. It's a partnership he revealed had started by \"accident\", but one he's kept since 2002, describing it as \"the coolest thing\".\"If you think about it from a child's perspective, they're seeing someone that they've seen on TV watching WWE or in films, and they suddenly get to meet him,\" Dr Brooks says. \"The fact that he's doing charity work, he's written a children's book, been in films, made music… all these things illustrate that he's not a one show pony.\"It's coming across in a way that's very authentic and very sort of pure to who he is.\"Both Cena's personal brand and his charisma are set to live on, but his time in the ring looks to have come to an end after Cena announced last year that 2025 would be his last as a competitor.Getty ImagesCena reached his 500th wish-granting milestone in 2015The retirement runExplaining his reasoning at the time, he told of the physical toll wrestling had taken on his body.His career has seen him undergo several operations, including on his neck, pec and triceps, with Cena saying in interviews that his \"body hurts\" and is \"screaming to close the chapter\".While the old saying \"never say never\" is a popular one, Cena has repeatedly said he will be \"100% done\" - and has received rousing receptions around the world for his final appearances.Overall, fan Joe is happy with Cena's \"retirement run\", with matches against old rivals such as AJ Styles, Randy Orton and CM Punk, and newer stars including Dominik Mysterio and Gunther.He does feel the \"execution\" of his final year could have been better though, with Cena's short-term \"heel turn\" (becoming a villain) at the Elimination Chamber event in March drawing criticism.\"It could have been handled better,\" Joe says. \"[But] he's had such a unique distinction of having a retirement run that no one's ever had before.\"It's very sad to see him retire now. But I think he said it himself - it's the right time.\"Not that WWE fans will never see Cena again; he has signed a five-year deal to be an ambassador for the company.Having won The Last Time Is Now tournament, it's former world heavyweight champion Gunther who will be Cena's one opponent in his final fight.With it not being broadcast on terrestrial TV, but rather on streaming platforms, it's been reported that there is no time limit on the match - and Gunther, who has never wrestled Cena before, has been giving much tough talk.One thing's for sure: \"You Can't See Me\" might be the taunt Cena gives Gunther, but the last fight will be seen and remembered by many.WWE via Getty ImagesJohn Cena lands a \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\" on AJ Styles in Perth, AustraliaMore weekend picks",

    "body": "2025 was a crazy year in politics. But 2026 could be wild14 minutes agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergBBCGoodbye 2025 - almost. It's not worth saying, \"Goodness me, the news is crazy\".\"Normal\" retired many years ago. But which events of this wild year actually changed us, and our politics? And what might 2026 usher in?As the UK hurtles towards the holidays, I've been asking contacts from across the political spectrum for the moments that boggled their minds this year, and those daring, perhaps foolish, but fascinating predictions of what might come next.2025 was chock-a-block with events scriptwriters would have found hard to come up with.There was the Oval Office showdown when US President Donald Trump seemed deliberately to shame the leader of Ukraine, described by one MP as the \"maddest moment\".EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump clashed in the White House in February.At home: a Labour cabinet minister, Steve Reed, being feted with chants of \"build, baby build\" and a mini swarm of activists sporting red MAGA-style hats as if, for a moment, Labour's Merseyside conference was like a Make America Great Again rally. You wouldn't have bet on such a surreal scene this time last year.Chancellor Rachel Reeves crying on camera in the Commons chamber counts too - not just because of the human drama, but because, as one source suggests: \"Global investors changed their behaviour as a result.\"Yes, the second most senior politician in the land was in tears in public in the bear pit of Prime Minister's Questions. Yes, the financial markets seemed to react, and secured her job. The whole Budget set of decisions being published in error by the official number crunchers, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before the chancellor stood up to deliver… the budget, takes some beating as a plot twist.And a new force on the left emerging under the Corbynista banner, but falling into disagreements with each other in spectacular style - perhaps sadly, for many on the left, that might have been easier to predict.Don't forget, No 10 advertising its own vulnerability by proclaiming that prime minister Sir Keir Starmer would see off any challengers seeking to oust him – before any of the would-be challengers were remotely ready to come out of the shadows. Nigel Farage's insurgent party, Reform, claiming to have more members than the Tories and Labour.Those crazy bits aside, time and again, insiders point to three factors of 2025 that have really changed where things are at.The rise of ReformWhether you love, loathe or shrug at the idea of Reform UK prospering, the rise of  Farage's party - ahead in the polls for many months - has changed much in the last 12 months.One former minister says, without question, the most important phenomenon in 2025 is the \"rise of Reform and the death of the Tories\".Reform's success in the elections in May gave them power over billions of pounds in local government for the first time. And it put the frighteners on the traditional parties, pushing their policy agendas on immigration in particular.Getty ImagesLabour now walks and talks as if Reform is their main opposition, not the Conservatives, even though their leader Kemi Badenoch's performance has improved in the last few months.With Reform's polling success comes increased attention, and more scrutiny. How they handle that, not least allegations of racism, is a question for 2026, but the standard symmetry of politics of Labour v Tories is firmly out of fashion, for now.When Sir Keir's authority began to drain awaySecond, multiple sources cite a specific moment. Cast your mind back to the government's ambition to change the creaking system that leaves too many people on benefits without support to find work or improve their prospects. They also wanted to save cash for the taxpayer.Labour backbenchers were so angry about the implications that after months of campaigning, ministers at almost the very last minute ditched that plan.The government couldn't be sure it would win the votes, so it gave up, even though ministers say they haven't given up on making changes.But for a government with a majority you can see from space it was an extraordinary state of affairs, the moment when Sir Keir's authority began truly to drain away.One Whitehall insider agreed it was the biggest moment of the year, because \"almost everything else has flowed from it - from then, the government was not in control of its political destiny with its own party since, and we wouldn't have had the budget we did without it\".For the country's balance sheet, the hoped-for savings disappeared, and with this, critics would suggest, any Labour ambition of saving cash from big changes to policy at home.PA MediaThat decision set the backdrop for the late autumn budget which had a traditional Labour clarity, but asked firms and families to pay more tax.One opposition source said the government has showed this year that benefits are \"out of control\", adding: \"The decision to increase this at the cost of working people will have a consequence at the polls.\"Even in the Labour Party the upshot is both welcomed and worried about.One source called the budget \"the most significant as they have dumped austerity at all costs and moved away from welfare cuts\".Another told me the whole affair is why Sir Keir, despite his huge majority, ends this political year with no guarantee he'll keep his job in the next.If 2024 showed Labour could win but would have a hard time adjusting to power, 2025 has raised questions about the extent to which they were really capable of governing well at all.The behaviour of Trump 2.0Whatever has happened at home, 2025 has also been another year of hefty international political moves.Trump moved back into the White House and really seems to have meant all of the things he told the world he believed in while campaigning.Sir Keir, while regularly under attack at home, seems to have impressed the American president and some of his home audience. His moment in the Oval Office, proffering the invite from the King for a historic second state visit, \"the most heart in mouth\" moment of the whole year for some of his allies.Brokering the most sensitive and the most important diplomatic relationship you have, live on global TV, can't have been the most tempting prospect for a non-showy politician like Sir Keir, who nonetheless, made a success of that moment.Many insiders suggest the most dramatic and the most important factor of 2025 has been the behaviour of Trump 2.0.Trump's increasingly insistent demands that Europe pays much more to cover its own defence rather than rely on America have shaped politics everywhere.His moves to create a ceasefire after the conflict between Gaza and Israel changed the course of the Middle East.And that's before we even start to consider his flirtation with the notion of creating an all-out global trade war, which hasn't quite come to pass.2025 saw the UK political establishment get used to feeling constantly nervous about what Trump might do next, the perpetual guessing game of whether he really meant what he said, and what the consequences might be.As we prepare to say goodbye to 2025, Reform's rise, Labour's woes and Trump's presence have changed our politics. So what will the next twelve months bring?Breath being held ahead of 'mega-May'Predictions are by their very nature a guess. 2025's splintered politics, the current prospering of smaller political parties, the advance of Zack Polanski's Greens, for example, may not last.The economic fug that has lasted for years might lift, slower inflation and interest rates cuts could shift that stubborn sense that the UK's economic fortunes are characterised by decline.No 10 hopes its efforts to feed more kids before school by expanding breakfast clubs, cut back NHS waiting lists, provide more childcare and sort out the creaking asylum system could see not just the statistics turn their way but demonstrate that its choices might lead to better experiences for the public and, in time, some political reward - or at least an end to blame and shame.Breath is already being held ahead of mega-May - a huge set of elections where some predict with confidence Reform will \"trounce the others\", a former minister says.Getty ImagesZack Polanski, Mothin Ali and Rachel Millward are set on taking the Green Party in a new direction.An ally of Farage says the \"sense of disbelief and disappointment is even greater than it was 12 months ago\", predicting huge success in England, and in the Welsh and Scottish elections in May too.But an experienced Conservative source reckons the most important vector of next year is that Reform will \"under-perform against expectations\".Plaid Cymru stopped Reform in its tracks at the Caerphilly by-election in 2025. Farage's rivals reckon voters on the left could come together in the same kind of ways in future.Perhaps that's more hope than expectation, but it's not impossible that 2025's froth around Reform will subside.Will the PM last the year?The anxious wait until May's elections is linked to a very common prediction that would have been almost unimaginable 12 months ago.You've heard the speculation about whether the PM is the right man for the job.Even some cabinet ministers tell me the May elections will be followed by an attempt to remove Sir Keir.Whether you think it would be crackers for Labour to try to get rid of one of the two leaders alive who have won a general election, or whether it makes sense to pull up stumps on a prime minister every poll suggests the public doesn't like, many Labour MPs are convinced 2026 will be defined by a \"seemingly inevitable\" change at the top.Inevitable is a word used by many. But that doesn't remotely mean it is automatic.One Labour source says \"a lot of mad stuff is going to happen because everyone is acting really stupidly\".Downing Street is making significant efforts to build up the PM's appeal to his own party. Gags abound in Labour about how many MPs have been invited to the PM's country retreat for small talk and canapes. But in the face of deep unpopularity there is a widespread belief that a bad performance in mega-May will mean the end for Sir Keir.There is no consensus on who should be next if the PM was challenged.And there is no certainty a hypothetical challenger would be able to oust him if he, as was provocatively briefed, tried to fight on.Without doubt his leadership doesn't feel permanent, and that casts a genuine shadow over so much of what the government is trying to do.But, even when politicians say, \"We can't go on like this\", a less-than-tasty status quo can still be more tempting than an uncertain road.Whatever happens at home, naturally in our interconnected world what happens elsewhere - and most notably the whims and wherefores of the American president - will have much sway over everything in 2026.As I write, European leaders are gathering their teams, fretting, planning, hoping.  Worrying that Ukraine's future is at risk, not just because of the original aggression of Putin's invasion, but because of America's attitude – the desire to end the war seemingly stronger than the belief in Ukraine's integrity.But for the economy, for our continent's security, and the government's relationship with its most powerful ally, one senior official predicts \"the most important thing will be the terms on which a Ukrainian peace settlement comes\".The costs to Ukraine could be costs to European security, and us all.So as we prepare to say goodbye to 2025, 2026 might be even more eventful. It's not impossible the conflict on the edge of our continent will end, although any agreement to bring it to a close might just store up future problems.It's feasible there'll be an attempt to get rid of the prime minister, and it's not impossible Reform and the smaller parties will grab more actual power. It won't be long till we find out.Tomorrow, in our last programme of the year, we'll be joined by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and the new boss of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson.Thank you to you for reading, watching and listening, and Happy Christmas!Top image credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Why Jane Austen's characters are still so relatable3 hours agoShola LeeBBC NewsBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonIf you're a Jane Austen fan, then Lizzy, Jane, Kitty and Lydia are likely to be the Bennet sisters you remember from Pride and Prejudice. But in a new follow-on to the story, it's their anxious and awkward sister Mary who takes centre stage.\"I came to [Jane] Austen as a kid from Croydon, in my teens, thinking that she couldn't possibly have anything to say to me,\" says Sarah Quintrell, screenwriter for the upcoming BBC drama The Other Bennet Sister.However, after reading the author's works, she couldn't believe how connected she felt to Austen's characters. It was as though she \"knew everybody\" in the 19th century novels, she says.The new TV series, based on the novel of the same name by Janice Hadlow, centres on the Bennet family's middle sister, Mary, as she becomes a governess to the Gardiner family.BBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonCostume designer Sian Jenkins curated each of the sisters' costumes around a specific flower. Jane's are based on a rose, Lizzy a cornflower, Kitty an iris and Lydia a \"wild\" primrose to accentuate their personality traits.It continues on from Austen's Pride and Prejudice - a story that centres on the relationship of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy, in which Mary's most memorable scene is her awkwardly playing piano at a ball.Actress Ella Bruccoleri, who plays the teenage Mary, says she was drawn to the character because she's an \"atypical period drama heroine\" who is anxious, awkward and possesses none of the poise other Regency period protagonists hold.Quintrell adds: \"She's the odd one out. It's really hard for her to find her place in the world. And I think that that will really resonate with a modern audience.\"The screenwriter encourages young people to engage with Austen's fictional worlds, as she has. \"You will find so much that's recognisable.\"On Tuesday, it is Austen's 250th birthday. With Pride and Prejudice published in 1813, why do the cast and crew of this new drama think her work continues to speak to people?Coming of ageBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonMary's colour of dress continues to shift and change throughout the series starting with beige tones.Maddie Close, who plays Jane Bennet in the upcoming series, says Mary's coming-of-age story and journey to self-acceptance is more relevant than ever.\"It is just so beautiful to watch her blossom and find herself,\" she says, adding that stories like Mary's are especially needed for teenagers trying to navigate the world and social media.Grace Hogg-Robinson, who plays Mary's sister Lydia Bennet, agrees, and adds that Austen's characters stand the test of time because people often meet them at important junctures in their life - for example, when studying Pride and Prejudice at GCSE.The actress believes Mary is \"much more relatable\" to a modern audience than some of the more iconic Austen characters, explaining that \"so many people feel like the person that no-one ever quite remembers\".\"It's really nice to tell that story,\" she adds.Poppy Gilbert, who plays Lizzy Bennet, says Mary is the sister she relates to the most and says others will too, thanks to her experiences of feeling \"constantly compared\" to others.Costume designer Sian Jenkins tried to demonstrate Mary's journey to finding herself through her wardrobe, which throughout the series transitions from creams and beiges to bold greens and reds, despite her mother, the infamous Mrs Bennet, berating her at every turn.Bruccoleri adds that the biggest journey her character goes on in the show is trying to find a way to remove herself emotionally from her overbearing mother. In order to do this, she has to learn to live without her \"approval or validation\" and give this to herself instead.Relationships and societyBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonRichard E Grant plays Mr Bennet and Ruth Jones plays Mrs Bennet in the new seriesBruccoleri says Austen's dry, funny writing provides sharp societal commentary without shoving its message \"down your throat\".\"Mrs Bennet just doesn't value Mary in the way that she values the other sisters, because she sees their values as so closely linked to their marriageability,\" she says.Molly Wright, who plays Kitty adds that Austen is \"so ahead of her time\" in her views on \"marriage and feminism\" in Pride and Prejudice.Hogg-Robinson, who plays Lydia, says that it took her time to realise \"how accurate and insightful\" Austen's works were after skim-reading them for her GCSEs and then picking them up later as an adult.She says that Austen's perspective on love and relationships continue to resonate, and points to a TikTok trend which centres on how Mr Darcy changes his behaviour to win over Lizzy in the original novel.\"Everyone was doing that [trend] 'Well, if he wanted to, he would', and Jane Austen got that 250 years ago,\" she explains.Modern AustenBBC/Bad Wolf/James PardonBruccoleri says she would love if people were to finish the show and say \"I'm a Mary Bennet\"Screenwriter Quintrell feels very lucky to have contributed to a follow-on story in the world of Pride and Prejudice.While two centuries may have elapsed, \"the characters and the emotional journeys that they go on really feel like they haven't aged at all,\" she says.This, she feels, is why people like her and novelist Hadlow want to continue to extend the Bennets' story.Gilbert says the new series feels like a \"behind-the-scenes\" Pride and Prejudice, and that viewers can expect to see the siblings not just interact in ballrooms but \"yapping in the bathroom\" and looking after the family dog.Ultimately, Quintrell says it's really important to open the story of Pride and Prejudice out, because growing up, she felt the works belonged to scholars and academics and that she was not allowed to \"own\" the texts.\"Wherever you're from, wherever you grow up, you'll find something to connect to in Austen's work, and hopefully in The Other Bennet Sister,\" she says.The Other Bennet Sister is coming soon to the BBC.Additional reporting by Samuel Spencer.More weekend picks",

    "body": "16 hours agoHulton Archive via Getty ImagesVibeke VenemaandLaura Gozzi,BBC World Service\"Every moment of that abortion was a surprise to me,\" says Annie Ernaux.The French Nobel literature laureate is talking about an illegal abortion that nearly ended her life in 1963.She was a 23-year-old student with ambitions to become a writer. But as the first in a family of labourers and shopkeepers to go to university, she could feel her future slipping away.\"Sex had caught up with me, and I saw the thing growing inside of me as the stigma of social failure,\" she wrote later.Her one-word diary entries, as she waited for her period, read like a countdown to doom: RIEN. NOTHING.Her options were to induce an abortion herself or find a doctor or backstreet abortionist who would do it at a price. The latter, usually women, were known as \"angel-makers\".But it was impossible to get any information. Abortion was illegal and anyone involved - including the pregnant woman herself - could go to prison.\"It was secret, nobody talked about it,\" the 85-year-old says. \"The girls of the time absolutely did not know how an abortion happened.\"Ending the silenceErnaux felt abandoned - but she was also determined. When writing about this time, she wanted to show how much strength it took to face this problem.\"Really it was a battle of life and death,\" she says.In plain, factual language, Ernaux describes the events in unflinching detail in her book, Happening.Turned away by doctors, and unable to do it herself, she eventually found a backstreet abortionist.\"It's the detail that matters,\" she says.\"It was the knitting needle I brought back from my parents' house. It was also that when I finally miscarried, I didn't know that there would be a placenta to pass.\"After the backstreet abortion, she was rushed to hospital, haemorrhaging, from her university dormitory.\"It was the worst violence that could be inflicted on a woman. How could we have let women go through this?\" she says. \"I wasn't ashamed to describe all that. I was motivated by the feeling that I was doing something historically important.\"I realised that the same silence that had reigned over illegal abortion was carried over to legal abortion. So I said to myself, 'All this is going to be forgotten.'\"Happening, published in 2000, is now on the school syllabus in France and has been made into a multi-award-winning film.Getty ImagesAnnie Ernaux first described her abortion in an autobiographical novel published in 1974 - a year before abortion was legalised in FranceErnaux says it is important for young people to know the dangers of illegal abortion, because politicians sometimes seek to restrict access to legal abortion. She points to recent events in some US states and Poland.\"It is a fundamental freedom to be in control of your body and therefore of reproduction,\" she says.Abortions are now a constitutional right in France - the first country to guarantee this - but Ernaux wants recognition for the countless women who died following illegal abortions.Nobody knows exactly how many, because the cause of death was often disguised. It has been estimated that between 300,000 and one million women had illegal abortions every year in France before it was legalised in 1975.\"I think they deserve to have a monument, like there is to the unknown soldier in France,\" she says.Ernaux was part of a delegation to propose such a monument to the Mayor of Paris earlier this year, but whether any action is taken will depend on the outcome of elections in March.The subject still has the power to shock. Audience members are routinely carried out of the theatre when watching a stage adaptation of Ernaux's book, The Years, which also features an abortion scene.Ernaux says she has had some funny reactions. One male university professor told her: \"it could have been me!\"\"That shows up this extraordinary fear of women's power,\" she says.In her work, Ernaux fearlessly examines her own life.Her books touch on shameful subjects that many have experienced, but few dare speak about - sexual assault, dark family secrets, losing her mother to Alzheimer's.\"These things happened to me so that I may recount them,\" is how she ends Happening.In A Girl's Story, she recounts her first sexual experience, working at a summer camp, when an older camp leader assaulted her.At the time, she did not understand what was happening, and was \"a bit like a mouse in front of a snake, who doesn't know what to do\".Now, she accepts it would be considered rape, but she says her book does not include this word. \"Because what's important to me is to describe exactly what happened, without judgement.\"Gamma-Rapho via Getty ImagesErnaux bought a home outside Paris with the money from her first literary prizeThese events were recorded in her personal diaries, which Ernaux kept from the age of 16. After she married, these precious items were kept in a box in her mother's loft, together with letters from her friends.But in 1970, when Ernaux's mother came to live with her and her family, she brought everything from the loft - except that box and its contents.\"I understood that she had read them and thought they should be destroyed,\" says Ernaux. \"She must have been completely disgusted.\"It was an incalculable loss, but Ernaux did not want to ruin their relationship with a pointless argument. And as an attempt by her mother to erase the past, it failed.\"The truth survived the fire,\" Ernaux writes in A Girl's Story.Without her diaries to refer to she relied on her memory, which proved to be sufficient, she says.\"I can take a walk through my past, as I wish. It's like projecting a film.\"This is also how she wrote her seminal book The Years, a collective history of the post-war generation.\"I simply had to ask myself, 'What was it like, after the war?' And I can visualise and hear it,\" she says.These memories are not just her own, but those shared by the people around her. Ernaux grew up in her parents' cafe in Normandy, surrounded by customers from morning until night.It meant she learned about adult problems from a young age - which embarrassed her.\"I wasn't sure if my classmates knew as much about the world as I did,\" she says. \"I hated that I knew about men who were drunk, who drank too much. So I was ashamed of a lot of things.\"'I will write to avenge my people'Ernaux writes in a pared-down, unadorned style. She developed it, she once said, when she started writing about her father, a working man for whom plain language seemed appropriate.At the age of 22, she wrote in her diary: \"I will write to avenge my people,\" a sentence that has been her guiding light. Her aim was to \"redress the social injustice linked to social class at birth\", she said in her Nobel lecture in 2022.As someone who moved from a rural, working-class life to a middle-class life in the suburbs, she calls herself an internal migrant.For the past 50 years she has lived in Cergy, one of five \"new towns\" built around Paris, where she moved with her then husband and children. In 1975 it was still under construction, and she has watched the town grow around her.\"We are all equal in this space - all migrants, from within France and from outside.\" she says. \"I don't think I would have the same perspective on French society if I lived in central Paris.\"She bought the house she lives in now with money from her first literary prize.A book about her affair with a Soviet diplomat struck a chord with many readersThe connection with her audience is important for Ernaux.When a passionate love affair with a married Soviet diplomat ended in 1989, it was writing about it that helped her recover.After the publication of that book, A Simple Passion, consolation came her way from readers.\"Suddenly I started receiving many many accounts from women, and men, who told me about their own love affairs. I felt like I had allowed people to open up about their secret,\" she says.There is a certain amount of shame involved in having an all-consuming affair, she adds, \"but at the same time, I have to say that it is the most wonderful memory of my whole life\".This content was created as a co-production between Nobel Prize Outreach and the BBCMore weekend picks",

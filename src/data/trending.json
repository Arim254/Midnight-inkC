    "body": "Wolves finally have their man.Rob Edwards' appointment on a three-and-a-half-year contract follows the sacking of Vitor Pereira earlier in November.Edwards arrives at Molineux having left Championship side Middlesbrough, who he joined as head coach in June, but eyebrows have been raised at his choice to leave a side second in the second tier for one eight points adrift of safety, winless and rock bottom of the Premier League.Meanwhile, for Wolves, there is the question whether Edwards is the right man to help them pull off a great escape for a second successive season?The 42-year-old appeared to have set Middlesbrough on the right track after being appointed manager in the summer, but the pull of his former club proved just too strong to resist.It is understood Edwards views the Wolves job as his dream role, having made more than 100 appearances for the Molineux side between 2004 and 2008. He also grew up in nearby Telford and has family in the area.Is Edwards the right appointment? Have your say hereThe gamble for Edwards is that he will need to unite a fractured club where fans' frustrations with the ownership have bubbled over.Swapping a Premier League promotion challenge for a battle to stay in the top flight is brave enough at the best of times, let alone when the club in question appear to have big issues in the background.Anger towards owners Fosun and executive chairman Jeff Shi is widespread, even if the fans are unlikely to achieve their ultimate goal of pressuring Fosun to sell.Wolves are aware of the division and Edwards will be joined by Harry Watling, who takes on the role of assistant head coach and was part of his team at the Riverside Stadium.Sources have also told BBC Sport that Paul Trollope, Joleon Lescott and Conor Coady have been sounded out over potential roles in a new-look backroom staff. The potential additions of Lescott and Coady are rated as difficult to complete - particularly the latter who is still playing for Wrexham.One thing Edwards has to his advantage is his lack of recent involvement at Wolves, this in contrast to other reported candidates.The potential reappointment of former boss Gary O'Neil, sacked 11 months ago and still being paid by the club under the terms of his severance package, could have widened the divide still further.Supporters had turned against O'Neil by the end of his reign last December, while Shi said in the summer the club waited too long to sack him.O'Neil perhaps shrewdly ruled himself out of the running last week. He had concerns about what he would be inheriting, especially the structure off the pitch.That aspect has not put Edwards off.Former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC Match of the Day: \"I get his connection with Wolves but I think Middlesbrough give him a big opportunity and this is a huge risk for him as I don't see them staying up. It is a big gamble.\"Where the gamble lies for Wolves is that Edwards' only full-time Premier League managerial experience saw his one season in the top flight with Luton in 2023-24 end in relegation.He guided the Hatters to the Premier League for the first time but was then unable to halt a slide into League One, leaving Kenilworth Road in January of this year.Two Premier League relegations would not look great on Edwards' record, but he is keen on the job and a return to his roots, and will back himself to lead the team away from danger.Edwards won the Premier League 2 title with Wolves Under-23s in 2019, describing the moment as the best in his career at that time.\"It was probably one of the best feelings in 20 years of professional football that I've had. It was amazing, I felt so proud of the boys,\" he said.Now Edwards is at the helm, another career highlight would come with his first game in official charge - Edwards had a two-game caretaker spell in 2016 - against Crystal Palace at Molineux on 22 November.Wolves' 3-0 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday left them winless in the league this season after 11 games.It is just the second time in their history Wolves have failed to win any of their opening 11 league matches - the other being 1983-84 when they were relegated from the top flight.No club has ever survived in the Premier League from this position, leaving Edwards a monumental task to rescue the club's season.January additions will be key - if they are still in touching distance - but Wolves need to revamp their transfer strategy.The sales of Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were the latest high-profile departures after previous exits of Ruben Neves, Pedro Neto, Diogo Jota and Max Kilman.Eventually, selling a team's best players and failing to replace them effectively will prove costly, even with profit and sustainability limitations.There is a desire to add more homegrown players over the next few transfer windows.The club recognise what is missing, with only Sam Johnstone, Matt Doherty, back-up goalkeeper Dan Bentley, young striker Tawanda Chirewa and defender Ki-Jana Hoever classed as homegrown players.Of that group, only Johnstone started the loss to Fulham which ended Pereira's reign.There have been transfer targets in mind.Middlesbrough's Hayden Hackney has been discussed previously at Wolves, and the England Under-21 international turned down a £20m move to Ipswich in the summer to stay at the Riverside.He has enjoyed working with Edwards at Middlesbrough, believing staying for his development and not making a move to another Championship club was better for his career.Even with the Edwards link, attracting players of that ilk - or indeed any player -would be a problem for Wolves in January if they are cut adrift and have little hope of survival.There surely will be additions, though, with an acceptance Wolves must spend again after needing to sign Marshall Munetsi and Emmanuel Agbadou last winter to aid their survival hopes.A flurry of signings followed in the summer as attacker Fer Lopez, winger Jhon Arias, left-back David Moller Wolfe, right-back Jackson Tchatchoua, striker Tolu Arokodare and defender Ladislav Krejci arrived. Krejci aside, they have taken too long to adapt to the Premier League and Pereira argued they were not top of his target list, some being fifth-choice picks.Pereira was unhappy at the speed Wolves moved in the summer as moves for Marc Pubill, Juanlu Sanchez and Christantus Uche - who eventually joined Crystal Palace - failed to get finalised.The upheaval at Wolves has also gone beyond the departure of Pereira.Domenico Teti, the head of professional football, left Molineux two days after the head coach, having joined in June following a shake-up which involved the departure of former sporting director Matt Hobbs.Wolves will be looking to replace Teti, although it may mean a more prominent role for Matt Jackson - the director of player recruitment and development - in the interim.Wolves feel this year has seen them start on a new cycle in terms of recruitment and more conservative spending power.But after appointing their fifth manager in four years it all feels very familiar.",

The US pop star is going back to her acting roots with plans to star in and produce a musical movie inspired by Alice in Wonderland, according to multiple US media outlets.  The unnamed project is being made for Universal Pictures and will be written and directed by US filmmaker Lorene Scafaria, reports claim.  BBC Newsbeat has contacted Carpenter's representatives and Universal for comment.A 'Busy Woman'It's not clear who Carpenter will play in the adaptation or when it will go into production.If it goes ahead, it will be Carpenter's first time leading a major studio film.The 26-year-old singer is said to have approached Universal last year with ideas for it. As the wonderland became more of a reality, Scafaria reportedly decided to join the madness.Writer and director Scafaria is best known for her work on Hustlers, a 2019 film fronted by Jennifer Lopez about a crew of strippers in New York City. Carpenter has recently been nominated for six Grammy Awards, including the coveted album of the year prize for her seventh album, Man's Best Friend. She is currently on the last leg of her Short n' Sweet Tour, which included two headline shows at London's BST Festival this summer. The upcoming film will not be the first time she's gone down the rabbit hole of acting. Getty ImagesCarpenter began her acting career on Disney Channel, playing Maya Hart in the TV series Girl Meets WorldCarpenter started out as a child actor on Disney Channel playing a recurring role as Maya Hart on the comedy series Girl Meets World.Since then, she's appeared in Netflix films Work It and Tall Girl, as well as 20th Century Fox's The Hate U Give.More recently, she's been announced as a \"guest star\" in a one-off Muppet Show special for Disney+, which will premiere in 2026.Previous Alice in Wonderland versions include the 1951 animated movie by Disney and Tim Burton's 2010 take with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. The story comes from Victorian author Lewis Carroll, who first published Alice's Adventures in Wonderland as a children's novel in 1865.It tells the tale of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands in a fantasy world of talking animals and creatures.

    "body": "1 hour agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesA Danish man has been convicted of sharing nude scenes from copyrighted films and TV series on the social media site Reddit.According to a police document seen by BBC News, the man - who is not named in the document - shared 347 clips of nude scenes on the Reddit group he moderated, which were then viewed 4.2 million times. The Danish police say he has been given a seven month suspended sentence for copyright infringement.Experts say the man was prosecuted under a rarely-used clause in Danish copyright law, with the judge finding that by taking the scenes out of their original context, the man had damaged the artists' \"moral rights\". He has also been convicted of sharing more than 25 terabytes of copyrighted data.From March 2022 to May 2023, the man known as \"KlammereFyr\" on Reddit posted sexually explicit scenes featuring over 100 actresses.He shared them in the subreddit - or forum - he was a moderator of.According to the Danish anti-piracy group The Rights Alliance (TRA), his subreddit had more than 6,000 members and users were encouraged to request for clips of specific actors.In 2023, campaigners reported the case to the police on behalf of the affected actors, directors and producers, which led to the subreddit being closed down.Andrea Vagn Jensen, one of the actresses whose explicit scenes were shared in the group, told the Danish broadcaster DR at the time she felt there was a difference between appearing naked in a film and appearing on Reddit.The actress said the posts amounted to \"abuse\".'An important signal'The man was arrested in September 2024 and pleaded guilty to the charges last month.In a statement following the verdict, TRA head Maria Fredenslund said the ruling sent an \"important\" signal \"that violations of artists' rights has consequences\".The ruling is considered unique in Denmark for its use of the \"moral rights\" section of the Danish Copyright Act, which states an artist's work cannot be used in a way which infringes upon their reputation.Copyright law expert Dr Alina Trapova told the BBC the case was \"rare\" for its focus on the damage to the integrity of an artist, rather than to them economically.How the case could affect other countries is unclear.But she said there may be \"more and more of these actions\" in the future with the growth of artificial intelligence, where \"the integrity of one's work might be tempered with much more easily\".",

    "body": "From YouTube team to the Prem: Ndiaye's unusual run to the top 7 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinBBC NewsbeatPA MediaEverton's Iliman Ndiaye did not have an easy run on his way to the top\"The way I play football gets people off their seats,\" says Iliman Ndiaye.Everton fans were certainly on their feet when the midfielder netted an early goal of the season contender against Sunderland earlier this month.After getting the ball on the right wing, he flashed past his opponents' defence in an impressive display of speed and skill before putting it away with his weaker foot. The Senegalese winger's talent is taken for granted now, but he had to work hard to prove himself before landing a spot in a Premier League starting line-up. He tells BBC Newsbeat that Rising Ballers, a media brand that uses grassroots initiatives to show off unsigned talent, was instrumental in helping him to showcase his skills.\"The things I was doing there, I wasn't doing at other clubs. It helped me stay fit and enjoy football more, especially when you don't have a club,\" he says.PA MediaIliman Ndiaye put Everton ahead against Sunderland this monthThe French-born footballer did not have an easy run on his way to the top, with numerous clubs rejecting him over the years, including Chelsea and Tottenham.He got close while with the Southampton development team, which led to a six-week trial at the club, but he didn't make the cut.The disappointing run continued until Boreham Wood, who are in the fifth tier of English Football, signed him in 2017.He later went on trial at Sheffield United where he was signed for the following season when he turned 19, but he needed to stay fit before starting.That's when Rising Ballers came in.\"I was playing five-a-side to keep fit and one of the guys was like: 'You've got to play for them',\" he recalls.  \"At first, they were like: 'No' - because they didn't know who I was.\"Then they said I could come in for a game and that's where they found out about my skill.\"'If you haven't been in an academy, it doesn't mean you won't make it'Only 180 of the 1.5 million boys playing organised youth football in England will ever play in the Premier League.Despite the odds being stacked against him, Ndiaye was determined to succeed, especially after one team told his father that he wouldn't make it as a professional.\"I have trained my whole time to be a football player and just believe in my ability,\" he says.\"You know that everything that you do in training, it's all going to pay off for one day.\"Don't focus on the rejection and one day your luck is going to come through.\"Rising Ballers says more than 15 players it has showcased have gone on to sign for professional clubs.They include Jerome Richards, who plays for Derby County, and Mohamed Keita, who is at Wycombe Wanderers.The brand taps into the power of social media by highlighting players to its millions of followers across its Instagram, YouTube and TikTok channels. It also generates more attention by working with brands on campaigns and hosting showcase events.'He was the one who made it'HandoutCurrent Rising Baller Kevar March-Mckenzie (left) is trying to follow in Ndiaye's footstepsTwo young footballers - 18-year-old Kevar March-Mckenzie and 20-year-old George Edwards - are trying to follow in Ndiaye's footsteps.At 16, Kevar was rejected after a three-week trial at Coventry, while George was part of many academies.Now, both have taken part in Rising Baller showcase games, where a group of grassroots players in London play in front of scouts.Both see Ndiaye as an inspiration to those who still haven't been signed.Kevar says everyone around him sees Ndiaye as a \"role model\" as \"he was the one who made it\".George grew up playing in junior squads for Arsenal, Tottenham and Queens Park Rangers before he stopped growing at around age 13 to 14.\"Everywhere I went I was told I was too small. I want to keep carrying on and prove them all wrong,\" he says. \"People would look at me and Kevar and probably think we've got no chance, but Iliman inspires us. He signed a professional contract at 19. Look at him now.\" HandoutGeorge Edwards grew up playing in junior squads for professional football teamsAcademies remain the most likely way into a professional football career.According to a report by the Premier League's Elite Performance Plan, over 11% of its top-level academy graduates go on to play at least 20 professional league games.And the English Football League - which represents clubs in the Championship, League One and League Two - say more homegrown academy players are now playing in their teams.Ndiaye believes his journey can be a source of inspiration for those who are not part of an academy.\"It's not easy being in an academy, but it's easier than those who are not in it, as they don't have that pathway,\" he says.\"So, you've just got to stay focused, train how they train, always stay sharp and take your chance when it comes.\"He feels his time at Rising Ballers helped him to become a professional after suffering so much rejection.\"When you have that atmosphere, it keeps you going.\"He says he will let others decide if he is the best \"baller\" in the Premier League, but he certainly puts himself up there.\"If I didn't score after my dribble against Sunderland, people would say they like the skill, but people would say I didn't finish after it.\"I don't just try and dribble, I try and get goals and assists.\"Premier League players are not going to let you get past them, you've got to work for it.\"In terms of what makes a baller, Ndiaye says it's simple. \"For me, it's skills,\" he says. \"It doesn't have to be a rainbow flick.\"The way you dribble past three, four players in the Prem, that's skills to me.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "A private investigator whose alleged confession of hacking led to household names, including Prince Harry, suing the publisher of the Daily Mail has claimed his signature on the statement was forged, the High Court in London has heard.Gavin Burrows, who was initially a witness central to the privacy case's most serious allegations of unlawful information gathering, said a statement dated August 2021 was \"prepared by others without my knowledge\".Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) is accused by the group, which includes Prince Harry, Sir Elton John, Liz Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, of \"grave breaches of privacy\".ANL has repeatedly denied the \"lurid\" and \"preposterous\" allegations.The claims include that it hired private investigators to bug homes, to engage in phone-hacking and to dishonestly gather medical and financial information.In a statement from August 2021, Mr Burrows allegedly claimed to have hacked voicemails, tapped landlines, and accessed financial and medical information at the request of a journalist at the Mail On Sunday.But on Tuesday, the court heard that in September this year Mr Burrows made a statement to ANL's lawyers claiming the 2021 document was false and that he had not signed it.\"I do not recognise the earlier witness statement of August 16, 2021 and I believe that my signature on that document is a forgery. A lot of it is not written in my type of language,\" he said.\"Further, the contents of the statement are substantially untrue.\"In the recent statement he also said he had not carried out work for the Mail On Sunday or the Daily Mail, apart from in one instance where he said he did a job related to Sir Richard Branson that \"did not involve any illegal activity\".Mr Burrows previously retracted his 2021 witness statement in 2023. The court is now hearing legal arguments about whether Mr Burrows will be called as a witness for the trial, scheduled to take place in January.David Sherborne, the barrister representing the group, has made an application to call Mr Burrows' evidence as hearsay, while defence lawyer for ANL, Antony White KC, has asked the court to allow him to cross-examine Mr Burrows. Mr Justice Nicklin said Mr Sherborne could have seven days to decide whether he wanted to apply for a witness summons to call Mr Burrows, and that if Mr Burrows gave evidence that was inconsistent with the evidence they had obtained, then he could apply to treat him as \"hostile\".Another pre-trial hearing is expected to take place for the case before the end of 2025.",

Gillian McKeith appeared to faint after she was voted to do her seventh trial in 2010.ITVThis year's line-up of contestants will be seen entering the jungle on SundayITV said all celebrities want a chance to do trials, and viewers don't want to see the same person doing them day after day.A spokesperson said: \"Show bosses are keen to give all campmates the opportunity to shine in Bushtucker Trials this year and are bringing in a new rule that after a celebrity has been voted for TWO trials in a row, they cannot be voted for one on the next day.\"This new rule means the responsibility for winning food is shared amongst more of the campmates.\"More campmates will have an opportunity to step up and play their part with viewers getting a chance to get to know them more, it's their chance to shine.\"This year's series will start on Sunday, with TV personality Jack Osbourne, comedian Ruby Wax and model and presenter Kelly Brook among the celebrities who are heading to the Australian jungle.Other famous faces include former Lioness Alex Scott, Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley and Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp.Rapper Aitch, social media personality Morgan Burtwistle, who is known as Angryginge, EastEnders' actress Shona McCarty and comedian Eddie Kadi round out the list.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSarah RainsfordEastern and Southern Europe correspondentAP Photo/Jerome DelayCivilians risked their lives to cross Sarajevo's main boulevard during the Bosnian warThe public prosecutor's office in Milan has opened an investigation into claims that Italian citizens travelled to Bosnia-Herzegovina on \"sniper safaris\" during the war in the early 1990s.Italians and others are alleged to have paid large sums to shoot at civilians in the besieged city of Sarajevo.The Milan complaint was filed by journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni, who describes a \"manhunt\" by \"very wealthy people\" with a passion for weapons who \"paid to be able to kill defenceless civilians\" from Serb positions in the hills around Sarajevo.Different rates were charged to kill men, women or children, according to some reports.More than 11,000 people died during the brutal four-year siege of Sarejevo.Yugoslavia was torn apart by war and the city was surrounded by Serb forces and subjected to constant shelling and sniper fire.Similar allegations about \"human hunters\" from abroad have been made several times over the years, but the evidence gathered by Gavazzeni, which includes the testimony of a Bosnian military intelligence officer, is now being examined by Italian counter terrorism prosecutor Alessandro Gobbis.The charge is murder.CHRISTOPHE SIMON/AFPMore than 11,000 civilians died in the three-year siege of SarajevoThe Bosnian officer apparently revealed that his Bosnian colleagues found out about the so-called safaris in late 1993 and then passed on the information to Italy's Sismi military intelligence in early 1994.The response from Sismi came a couple of months later. They found out that \"safari\" tourists would fly from the northern Italian border city of Trieste and then travel to the hills above Sarajevo.\"We've put a stop to it and there won't be any more safaris,\" the officer was told. Within two to three months the trips had stopped.Ezio Gavazzeni, who usually writes about terrorism and the mafia, first read about the sniper tours to Sarajevo three decades ago when Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported the story, but without firm evidence.He returned to the topic after seeing \"Sarajevo Safari\", a documentary film from 2022 by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic which alleges that those involved in the killings came from several countries, including the US and Russia as well as Italy.Gavazzeni began to dig further and in February handed prosecutors his findings, said to amount to a 17-page file including a report by former Sarajevo mayor Benjamina Karic.MICHAEL EVSTAFIEV/AFPSnipers would shoot at civilians from areas controlled by the Bosnian Serbs overlooking SarajevoAn investigation in Bosnia itself appears to have stalled.Speaking to Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, Gavazzeni alleges that \"many\" took part in the practice, \"at least a hundred\" in all, with Italians paying \"a lot of money\" to do so, up to €100,000 (£88,000) in today's terms.In 1992, late Russian nationalist writer and politician Eduard Limonov was filmed firing multiple rounds into Sarajevo from a heavy machine gun. He was being given a tour of hillside positions by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who was later convicted of genocide by an international tribunal in the Hague. Limonov didn't pay for his war tourism, though. He was there as an admirer of Karadzic, telling the so-called Butcher of Bosnia: \"We Russians should take example from you.\"The fact Milan prosecutors had opened a case was first reported back in July when Il Giornale website wrote that the Italians would arrive in the mountains by minivan, paying huge bribes to pass checkpoints as they went, pretending to be on a humanitarian mission.After a weekend shooting in the war zone, they would return home to their normal lives.Gavazzeni described their actions as the \"indifference of evil\".Prosecutors and police are said to have identified a list of witnesses as they try to establish who might have been involved.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoKate Whannel,Political reporter and Brian Wheeler,Political reporterSir Keir Starmer has insisted he has \"never authorised\" attacks on his cabinet ministers, calling briefings against them \"unacceptable\".The PM was speaking at Prime Minister's Questions after some of his allies told numerous media outlets he could face a leadership challenge from another cabinet minister such as Health Secretary Wes Streeting.There has been speculation about the extent to which Sir Keir was aware of the anonymous briefings, which had been aimed at shoring up his position, or had encouraged them in some way.Streeting has denied he was lining up a leadership bid, and called on those behind the briefings to be sacked.Asked at an NHS conference in Manchester if he would fight alongside Sir Keir if there were any plots to oust him as PM, Streeting said: \"Yes.\"\"The bizarre thing about some juvenile briefing overnight is it's people in No 10 who've said the PM is fighting for his job.\"I don't think that's a helpful or constructive thing to say, I also don't think it's true,\" he added.Streeting has attacked the \"toxic culture\" inside No 10, but has said he does not think the PM is behind the briefings.Asked whether he thought Sir Keir's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney was responsible for the culture in Downing Street, he said:  \"I am not going to add to the toxic culture by contributing to the toxic culture and going after individuals.\"I don't think that is a constructive or positive thing to do.\"One thing I would say for Morgan McSweeney is there wouldn't be a Labour government without him.\" At PMQs, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM had \"lost control of his government... and lost the trust of the British people\".She said McSweeney was responsible for the culture in No 10 and asked if the prime minister still had confidence in him. Sir Keir replied: \"Morgan McSweeney, my team and I are absolutely focused on delivering for the country. \"Let me be clear, of course, I've never authorised attacks on cabinet members, I appointed them to their post because they're the best people to carry out their jobs.\"Sir Keir told MPs \"any attack on any member of my cabinet is completely unacceptable\".He said Streeting - who missed PMQs to deliver a speech at the NHS conference - was doing a \"great job\" cutting waiting lists and boosting the number of doctors.Speaking after PMQs, the prime minister's press secretary told reporters the briefings against Streeting had come \"from outside No 10\" and that the prime minister had full confidence in McSweeney.The spokesperson refused to say whether there was a leak inquiry, but did say leaks would be \"dealt with\".Briefings of this nature are often part of reporting on politics in Westminster, when people speak to journalists \"off the record\".This means they say things that they are not prepared to say on camera, which the BBC reports in order to give the full story.On Tuesday evening, supporters of the prime minister told journalists he would fight a challenge to his leadership, which they believed could come as soon as after the Budget on 26 November.They argued that removing the PM could create chaos, destabilise the international markets and damage the relationship he has built with US President Donald Trump.The names being discussed by Labour MPs as potential candidates to replace Sir Keir include Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. There is also speculation Energy Secretary Ed Miliband could stand. Despite winning a landslide majority in the July 2024 general election, Sir Keir has had a rocky time in Downing Street and opinion polls suggest he is unpopular.Both the Budget in two weeks' time, and elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in England next year, are crunch points for the government.Supporters of the prime minister have argued a leadership contest would plunge the party into the chaos associated with the last years of the previous Conservative administration.In order to trigger a leadership contest against the prime minister, challengers would need the support of 20% of Labour MPs, which currently means 81 nominations would be required.Some Labour MPs and ministers have publicly and privately condemned the briefings. Appearing on BBC Politics Live, Business Minister Sir Chris Bryant said he thought they were \"plain daft\".Labour MP for Bassetlaw Jo White said: \"This is a group of people who think they're much cleverer than the rest of us, who spend their time selectively briefing journalists and stirring the pot.\"I want to simply say: we're not having it.\"But some Labour MPs who are usually supportive of the prime minister described the timing and substance of the briefing as \"badly handled\" and \"baffling\".One senior Labour figure questioned why Sir Keir's allies had \"legitimised what was a taboo\" by publicly entertaining the prospect of a leadership challenge.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestFamily photosBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar were killed in the 29 July 2024 attackThe parents of the Southport killer could be re-investigated by police after their comments during the public inquiry into the attack. Merseyside Police confirmed its detectives will examine transcripts after Alphonse Rudakubana and Laetitia Muzayire gave verbal evidence last week. The Southport Inquiry heard their son, Axel Rudakubana, had displayed disturbing and violent behaviour for years before he murdered three children and injured eight others at a Taylor Swift themed dance workshop on 29 July last year. The force had previously considered charges against his parents, but said in June the evidence did not meet the threshold for a referral to the Crown Prosecution Service. A spokesperson for Merseyside Police said the force would now \"assess whether new information was provided [to the inquiry] that wasn't known\". During the hearings, Alphonse Rudakubana accepted he had intercepted a package containing a machete that his son had ordered online in June 2023 and hid it on top of a wardrobe - but did not tell any agencies including mental health teams, police or social services. He told the inquiry: \"I regret that I didn't tell the police because, if I did, what happened on the 29th wouldn't have happened. \"They would have come and checked everything in his room.\"PA MediaThe girls' families said the evidence at the inquiry into the killings was \"deeply distressing\"He also said despite warnings from teachers that Rudakubana was looking up gory and violent images online, he was too afraid to restrict his teenaged son's internet access in case it provoked a violent response. \"I had no authority as a father, I had no power at all left to stop him from accessing anything he wanted online,\" he said. Mr Rudakubana also failed to report that his son had tried to leave the house in a taxi on 22 July 2024, a week before the attack, to head to Range High School in Formby which had expelled him in 2019. He admitted stopping his son from leaving because he feared he would launch an attack on the school, and believed he had been carrying a knife although he did not see it. 'Stayed silent'After the parents had given evidence, the families of the girls killed in the attack -Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and six-year-old Bebe King - released a statement condemning their failure to act.Elsie's parents, Jenni and David Stancombe, said they believed Mr Rudakubana and Mrs Muzayire \"should be held to account for what they allowed to happen\".\"They knew how dangerous he was, yet they stayed silent,\" they said.\"They failed not only as parents but as members of our society.\"Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, added: \"What we're struggling to comprehend is not just [the killer's parents'] failure then, but their failure now - to acknowledge, to take responsibility, to face up to what they allowed to happen.\"Solicitor Chris Walker, from law firm Bond Turner, which is representing the families of the murdered girls, told the Daily Mail newspaper his clients \"fully supported\" any reopening or re-examination of the evidence about Rudakubana's parents.\"We are confident that a criminal investigation will conclude that an offence has been committed,\" he added. Oral hearings in the first phase of the Southport Inquiry, which examined the attack itself and Rudakubana's background, are now complete. Inquiry chair Sir Adrian Fulford is expected to report back in spring 2026, before the opening of the second phase, which will look at the issue of young people becoming obsessed with violence and how to manage them.

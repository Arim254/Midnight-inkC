The groups were drawn from four pots, into which teams had been placed based on their position in Fifa's rankings.The top two teams in each group will qualify for the knockout stages, along with the eight best third-placed teams.England verdict: 'Difficult group, difficult opener'Media caption, Tuchel reacts to England's 'difficult' World Cup groupEngland head coach Tuchel oversaw a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign, his team winning all their eight matches without conceding a goal.Speaking to BBC Sport after the draw, the German said: \"Difficult group, difficult opener. Croatia and Ghana [are] two regulars in World Cups and two proud and strong nations. Panama I don't know much about at the moment, but we will before the tournament starts.\"For me, I've only experienced group football in Champions League formats and the way to approach it was to always give it the biggest respect and to put all the focus into winning the group. It always seems difficult, like our group now, but we are confident and we will be well prepared when we arrive.\"Croatia were the highest-ranked nation England could have drawn from pot two, and they are the side England lost to in the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup.In the group stage at that same tournament, England defeated Panama 6-1.\"Nobody should be underestimated. Of course Croatia is the standout nation but Ghana is always full of talent, can always surprise and has a big history in World Cup football,\" Tuchel said. \"Panama will try to make the most of their underdog role. No-one can be underestimated, everyone deserves the fullest respect.\"Media caption, How Croatia beat England in the 2018 World Cup semi-finalsScotland verdict: 'We'll bring a little bit of magic'Scotland stunned Denmark with two stoppage-time goals as they secured World Cup qualification in a dramatic winner-takes-all final group game last month.Nearly three decades after their most recent men's World Cup appearance, they will meet two of the nations they faced at France 98 in Brazil and Morocco, plus the lesser-known quantity of Haiti.Scotland boss Steve Clarke told BBC Sport: \"The draw is fantastic. One of the big things in my head was no European teams, so we're playing three top sides from three different continents of the world and that's what the World Cup is about.\"Looking ahead to facing record five-time champions Brazil, Clarke said: \"We are going to bring a little bit of magic as well, hopefully.\"It's great to play them. To go back to 1998, when Brazil and Morocco were in the group, that's a little bit of fate.\"Media caption, 'Bring it on' - Clarke releshing chance at World Cup after drawA World Cup of '104 Super Bowls'US President Donald Trump was awarded the new Fifa Peace Prize during a star-studded draw ceremony which lasted for more than two hours in Washington DC.Trump was presented with a trophy, medal and certificate by Fifa president Gianni Infantino and said the award, introduced to recognise an individual's actions for peace and unity, was \"one of the great honours of my life\".Fifa president Infantino described the 2026 World Cup for American viewers as equivalent to watching \"104 Super Bowls in one month\".The event was presented by comedian Kevin Hart, model Heidi Klum and actor Danny Ramirez, and featured live music performances by Andrea Bocelli, Robbie Williams, Nicole Scherzinger and Lauryn Hill.Ex-England and Manchester United player Rio Ferdinand conducted the draw with Samantha Johnson, accompanied by American sporting greats Tom Brady, Aaron Judge and Shaquille O'Neal, and Canadian ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky.Co-hosts Mexico, Canada and the United States had pre-determined group positions to ensure they will contest all group matches in their own countries.But Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum each drew their own nation's ball to begin proceedings.",

    "body": "15 hours agoDaniela Relph,Royal correspondentandAmy WalkerThe Duchess of Sussex has attempted to contact her estranged father, Thomas Markle, who is reported to be seriously ill in hospital in the Philippines.A spokesman for Meghan said: \"I can confirm she has reached out to her father.\"Mr Markle is reported to have had his leg amputated during surgery. The BBC understands that Meghan tried to contact him earlier today, but it is not clear whether the attempt was successful. The relationship between Meghan and her father broke down in the run-up to her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018.During the couple's engagement, the media interest in Thomas Markle and his family was intense. Mr Markle was found to have colluded with photographers who paid him for photos appearing to show the father of the bride preparing for the wedding.The fallout saw him pull out of his daughter's wedding just days before the ceremony in Windsor, citing health problems.King Charles III - who was then the Prince of Wales - walked Meghan down the aisle instead.It is not clear if Meghan ever resumed any proper relationship with her father following her marriage. Thomas Markle is not believed to have met Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.He was critical of his daughter and son-in-law's decision to step back from public duty in the UK and criticise the royal family. In one media interview he said: \"I think they're both turning into lost souls at this point.\"\"I don't know what they're looking for,\" he added. \"I don't think they know what they're looking for.\"",

A three-year-old is among the dead.\"At least three unknown gunmen entered this hostel where a group of people were drinking and they started randomly shooting,\" police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said.The motive of the shooting is unknown and no arrests have been made. It is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have rocked the crime-ridden country in recent years.The gunmen reportedly entered the premise at 04:30 local time (14:30 GMT) and opened fire on a group of men who were drinking. A 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl were among those killed in the attack.\"I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,\" Mathe said. Describing the hostel as an \"illegal shebeen\", she added: \"We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,\" where she said the majority of mass shootings occur.\"Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,\" she told public broadcaster SABC.South Africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world, at 45 people per 100,000 according to 2023-24 figures from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.Some 63 people were killed every day between April and September, according to police data.",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, International Space Station in the skies above New ZealandByShireen JordanBBC WeatherThere is plenty to keep stargazers amused through the rest of December.From a planetary conjunction to the astronomical start of winter to some of 2025's most prolific meteor showers.The month has already got off to a stunning start with a third consecutive supermoon lighting up night skies with the added interest of a rare double lunar halo and the Northern Lights also putting on a dazzling show. Of course these delights rely on clear weather conditions. Check the viewing potential where you live at BBC Weather.Not one but three meteor showers to enjoyThe Geminid meteor shower is active from 4 to 20 December and is one of the last major showers of 2025. It peaks on 14 December when the Moon is waning crescent. This should help viewing conditions as there will be less light pollution at a time when the Geminids have been known to produce over 120 meteors per hour. Meteors are pieces of debris that enter Earth's atmosphere, passing through the debris of a comet or an asteroid at speeds of up to 150,000mph (241,000km/h), vaporising and causing beautiful streaks of light caused by particles as small as a grain of sand.The meteors associated with the Geminids are some of the brightest and most abundant in the skies and appear as multi-coloured streaks of white, yellow, green, red and blue due to elements such as sodium and calcium found within the celestial debris. They were first observed in 1862 and according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich are thought to be intensifying every year.Image source, Carl JacoletteImage caption, Geminids meteor shower at St Aldhelm's Chapel, Dorset, in December 2023This is followed by the Ursid meteor shower which is active from 17 to 26 December, peaking between the 22 and 23. Meteors will appear to radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor, hence its name with a peak rate of just 10 meteors per hour. If you miss both the Geminids and Ursids, don't despair. The Quadrantids are active from 28 December and are one of the strongest and most consistent meteor showers of the year. They peak between 3 to 4 January 2026 in UK.Pre-Christmas planetary conjunctionAn early Christmas present of Moon and Jupiter in close proximity can be seen on 7 December. According to the Royal Museums Greenwich they will be best observed low on the horizon just after the Moon rises in the north-east.Whilst they look close together they are actually millions of miles apart.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, An image showing new Moon near planet JupiterMysterious comet at closest point to EarthThe Comet 3I/ATLAS  will be at its closest point to Earth on 19 December.It is an interstellar object (only the third ever detected) meaning it originates from outside our solar system. It is not bound to the Sun and will never return.It was first discovered in July and recent observations show that 3I/ATLAS has developed a faint bluish hue, suggesting a possible colour change - the third shift in its colouring since its discovery.The comet is more ancient than our solar system at over seven billion years old and provides valuable clues about planetary formation in other star systems.Speculation has arisen about it being an alien object, but NASA has dismissed these claims. It won't be visible to the naked eye but should be able to be viewed using an amateur telescope.The winter solstice and the start of astronomical winterImage source, D.Lentz/gettyimagesImage caption, Stonehenge at night with starry sky on winter solstice.The winter solstice marks the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere in the UK when Earth's axis is tilted at its furthest point from the Sun.It is also the longest night here and the start of astronomical winter.The solstice is actually a specific moment, not a whole day and in 2025 it happens at 15:03 GMT on 21 December.We have solstices because the Earth is tilted on its axis by 23.5 degrees, which affects which part of the planet's surface the Sun is directly overhead at any given time.International Space Station fly-byThe spacecraft should be visible above the UK for approximately four minutes at 05:56 GMT on 25 December. Although it will be dark, the International Space Station will be high enough to reflect the sunlight, helping it to be seen. It will be the third brightest object in the sky after the Moon and Venus and appear as a single, fast-moving bright star, easily spotted with the naked eye.And whilst you may have marvelled at the Cold Moon earlier in December, a fourth consecutive supermoon is on its way in early January. This one is known as the Wolf Moon and the last chance to see the Moon looking so big and close in our night skies until November 2026.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHelen Catt,Political correspondentandTabby WilsonTrans women will not be able to take part in the main session at Labour's Women's Conference next year.It follows a legal review into how the event should operate after the Supreme Court ruled in April that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities legislation.Trans women will not be able to take part in formal proceedings, including speeches in the main hall and policy debates but will be able to attend fringe events, which will be open to everyone regardless of their sex.It is understood the party considers the format to be the least restrictive way of balancing accessibility and compliance with the law.The Women's Conference, which is usually held the day before the party's annual conference in the same venue, was cancelled in 2025 after the party received legal advice in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.Prior to that ruling, Labour had allowed people to self-identify as a woman, so trans women could attend the event and also take part in \"positive action\" measures such as all-women shortlists.Labour launched a \"comprehensive legal review\" of the rules around its women's conference following the Supreme Court decision, a spokesperson said, before confirming the 2026 event would go ahead with new attendance rules in a place.The spokesperson continued: \"This reflects our commitment to addressing the under-representation of women in the Party and compliance with the law\".It comes as the government continues to weigh a new code of practice in light of the ruling, guidance which issued to public bodies and businesses on how to apply the Equality Act.The code has been redrafted by the equality watchdog, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and submitted to the government for ministerial sign off before coming into force.Equalities minister Bridget Phillipson received the draft three months ago but said she would take the time needed to \"get this right\" before publishing. The EHRC under its current leadership has previously called on the government to sign off on the guidance quickly. Outgoing EHRC head Baroness Falkner of Margravine told the Times she was \"so certain\" of the lawfulness of the guidance and suggested one explanation for the delay could be that the government was \"terrified of their MPs who would wish for trans self-identification or trans inclusion to prevail across all areas of society\".She said the delay had led to a \"grey zone\" being created around single-sex spaces.\"Some organisations are implementing it [the ruling] in one way, others are not,\" Baroness Falkner said.",

    "body": "Border clashes have erupted again between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban forces, with each sides accusing the other of breaking a fragile ceasefire.Residents fled the Afghan city of Spin Boldak overnight, which lies along the 1,600-mile (2,600 km) border between the two countries.A medical worker in the nearby city of Kandahar told BBC Pashto that four bodies had been brought to a local hospital. Four other people were wounded. Three were reportedly wounded in Pakistan.There has been sporadic fighting between the two countries in recent months, while Afghanistan's Taliban government has also accused Pakistan of carrying out air strikes inside the country.Both sides have confirmed they exchanged fire overnight but each blamed the other for initiating the four hours of fighting. Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accused the Taliban of \"unprovoked firing\".The statement continued: \"An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces. Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety our citizens.\"Meanwhile, a Taliban spokesperson said Pakistan had \"once again initiated attacks\" and said it was \"forced to respond\".Residents on the Afghan side of the border said the exchange of fire started at around 22:30 (18:00 GMT) on Friday.Footage from the area showed a large number of Afghans fleeing on foot and in vehicles. Ali Mohammed Haqmal, head of Kandahar's information department, said Pakistan's forces had attacked with \"light and heavy artillery\" and civilian homes had been hit by mortar fire.The latest clashes came less than two months after both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey.It ended more than a week of fighting in which dozens were killed - the worst clashes between Pakistan and the Taliban since the group returned to power in 2021 - though tensions have remained high.The government in Islamabad has long accused Afghanistan's ruling Taliban of giving shelter to armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan.The Taliban government denies the accusation and has accused Pakistan of blaming others for their \"own security failures\".The Pakistan Taliban have carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.Last week delegations from both sides met in Saudi Arabia for a fourth round of negotiations on a wider peace settlement, but did not reach an agreement.Sources familiar with the talks told BBC News that both sides had agreed to continue with the ceasefire.",

    "body": "12 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterA lifestyle app backed by Sarah Ferguson received more than £1m of taxpayers' money but collapsed without ever launching a product, according to documents filed this week.vVoosh was founded by Manuel Fernandez, a close friend of Ms Ferguson, who once described herself as an \"ambassador\" for the company and was an investor.It promised to give users \"the power to Find, Plan, Share, Live, and Remember all the things you love to do - and those you're yet to try.\"Ms Ferguson and Mr Fernandez did not respond to requests for comment.vVoosh was put into administration last month - and its failure will raise further questions about the judgement of the former duchess and the business relationships she pursued.Over the years the company raised approximately £9m, including more than £1m from the UK government through research and development tax credits, according to documents filed by the administrator.It paid teams in the UK and then India to work on the app, but never launched it, and so had no income to fund further development.Progress on the app stopped when the Indian contractor threatened legal action.The administrator's report describes a \"breakdown in communication between the current directors/major creditors and the founder [Mr Fernandez], who ceased communication following [his] resignation as a director earlier in the year\".The report says that the company is owed £324,609 by a former director. This is believed to be Mr Fernandez, who is the only director to leave the company since 2019.Last summer he sold his house in North London for £1.3m, according to Land Registry documents, and is believed to have left the UK.Meanwhile, vVoosh owes £50,000 to one of Ms Ferguson's companies, La Luna Investments, which also held just under 1% of the company's shares.Documents show the firm had more than 60 other small shareholders - many with addresses in Essex and London, though a few American addresses also appear.The administrators said that there was \"significant uncertainty\" over how much money the company's creditors would get back once the company was wound up.One of the firm's American backers, Mark Guzy, has put more than £400,000 into the company to preserve \"certain essential services\" and protect the value of its software platform, which is the company's main remaining asset.vVoosh originally intended to share 10% of its profits with a charitable foundation.The BBC understands that the Charity Commission has now begun the process of removing vVoosh Charitable Foundation from the register of charities, on the basis that it does not operate.It is more than four-and-a-half years overdue with its reporting. HMRC declined to respond to questions about the tax credits. Mr Guzy and the other directors of vVoosh declined to comment.Earlier this month Mr Fernandez denied taking money out of the firm, according to the Times.He told the newspaper that allegation would be \"disproven in the course of legal proceedings\".Ms Ferguson, 66, lost her duchess title when her former husband, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, relinquished use of his Duke of York title over his links with Epstein. He has since been stripped of the title of prince as well. Last month it emerged that a crypto-currency mining firm had agreed to pay her up to £1.4m for acting as a \"brand ambassador\" - that firm also failed, allegedly costing investors millions. Its co-founder denied misconduct and said he was working to repay backers. In September, a number of charities dropped her as a patron or ambassador after an email from 2011 revealed that she called sex offender Jeffrey Epstein her \"supreme friend\" and seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him. Mr Fernandez went to school at Billericay in Essex, and was a soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment, according to his LinkedIn profile. He then held senior sales roles at a number of tech companies before founding vVoosh in 2010.He was regularly photographed with the then duchess in 2015 and 2016, and they attended Sir Bob Geldof's wedding together, but she denied rumours they were a couple, saying they were just \"good friends\".Correction 6 December: An earlier version included financial figures for vVoosh charitable foundation, taken from the Charity Commission website, but the charity never traded.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoNardine SaadandHarry SekulichReutersRussia targeted a railway depot in the town of Fastiv outside KyivRussia has launched a major aerial bombardment against Ukrainian infrastructure targets as talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida are set to enter a third day.Overnight Russia launched 653 drones and 51 missiles, most of which were downed, authorities said. One strike hit a railway hub at the town of Fastiv outside Kyiv, destroying the main station building and damaging rolling stock.President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack had been \"meaningless from a military point of view, and the Russians could not have been unaware of this\".Earlier US and Ukrainian negotiators urged Russia to show a \"serious commitment to long-term peace\" after talks in Moscow failed to produce a breakthrough.Moscow has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy sector and infrastructure in recent weeks. On Saturday Ukraine's energy ministry said Russian attacks had hit energy facilities in eight regions, causing blackouts. Meanwhile the UN's nuclear watchdog said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all external power overnight - the 11th time this has happened since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbour.The Russian defence ministry said it had launched a \"massive strike\" in response to what it called Ukrainian attacks on civilian targets.\"Russia continues to disregard any peace efforts and instead strikes critical civilian infrastructure,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said.\"This shows that no decisions to strengthen Ukraine and raise pressure on Russia can be delayed. And especially not under the pretext of peace process,\" he added.In Florida, a statement posted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff said two days of talks with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine's national security council, had been \"constructive\".Witkoff and Umerov \"agreed on the framework of security arrangements\" that could such an agreement and \"discussed necessary deterrence capabilities to sustain a lasting peace\", their statement said without giving details.The prospect of ending the war depended on Russia's readiness to take \"steps towards de-escalation and cessation of killing\", the statement added.The negotiations, which are also attended by US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, will continue for a third day on Saturday. The Florida talks saw Ukraine's team briefed on a recent meeting between Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.ReutersThe strike in Fastiv damaged locomotivesWitkoff spent almost five hours with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin said \"no compromise\" had been reached on a draft US peace plan. The Kremlin said Putin was ready to continue meeting the Americans \"as many times as needed\", but Ukraine and its allies in Europe have called into question the Russian leader's commitment to ending the war.On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted to \"obtain full information about what was said in Moscow and what other pretexts Putin has come up with to drag out the war\".Kyiv pushed for revisions to the initial US peace plan, which was widely seen as favourable to Moscow when an initial version leaked to the media. An updated version has not been shared publicly.Major points of contention remain between the two sides, including security guarantees for Ukraine post-war and territorial concessions. Russia currently controls roughly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory, including swathes of the Donbas area in the east – made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In an interview with India Today on Friday, Putin warned Ukrainian troops to withdraw fully from the region this week, saying Russia would otherwise \"liberate these [Donbas] territories by force\".Kyiv and its European allies believe the most effective way to deter Russia from attacking again in the future would be to grant Ukraine membership of Nato, or to provide comprehensive security guarantees. Russia is staunchly opposed, while Trump too has repeatedly signalled he has no intention of letting Ukraine join the military alliance.The prospect of Ukraine joining Nato was a \"key question\" that was tackled in Moscow, the Kremlin said on Wednesday.Trump said those talks were \"reasonably good\", but it was too soon to say what would happen as \"it does take two to tango\".",

    "body": "Twitch star QTCinderella says she wishes she never started streaming14 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterBBCThe popular Twitch streamer QTCinderella says she would be a \"happier person\" if she could go back and tell her younger self to choose a different career.The 31-year-old, real name Blaire (she does not make her second name public), became famous for playing video games and cooking meals in live videos for her 1.2 million followers online.In 2021 she created the annual Streamer Awards, which will be streamed online on Saturday.But she told the BBC while she felt \"incredibly lucky\" to be in her position, the negatives of the role - ranging from being under constant scrutiny to at times being concerned for her safety - makes it difficult to enjoy.\"If I could go back and never experience some of the things I've experienced because of this job, I do think I would be a happier person overall,\" she said.\"The biggest thing I wish I could do, if I went back and was able to whisper in my ear, I would say, don't do it.\"Getty ImagesQTCinderella at the Streamer Awards in 2024Throughout 2025, several female content creators have spoken out about concerns of their safety, particularly when attending public events.In March, three US Twitch streamers, Cinna, Valkyrae and Emiru, were taking part in a week-long marathon stream when a man threatened to kill them.Then, at the annual streamer event TwitchCon in October, a man from the crowd grabbed Emiru and tried to kiss her without her consent.While her personal security were able to intervene, she accused the on-site security team of not detaining him until hours after the event - something Twitch refuted in a statement.Harassment - or the threat of it - is an issue which Blaire says she has also had to face since her rise in popularity online.\"I could open my Instagram DMs right now and read you 100 horrible things about why or how I could be harmed by people,\" she said.In 2021, Blaire said she spent over $2,000 (£1,500) every month to have heavily edited photos of her removed from the internet.Then in January 2023, she discovered a deepfake website was using a likeness of her in pornographic material, alongside other popular female streamers.Now, she said despite opening a craft shop in Los Angeles earlier this year, it's rare she ever visits - because of men turning up to the shop and asking for her.\"I thought it'd be fun,\" she said.\"Unfortunately, it's gotten to the point where I can't go there because we've had men show up looking for me.\"I don't want it to be unsafe for my employees.\"From drama to positivityBlaire said she thought security at the Streamer Awards would be \"aggressive\" in comparison to other events, as she hopes to help the attendees from the streaming world feel as safe as possible.The ceremony recognises top creators across various categories like Gamer of the Year and Best Community, while this year's Streamer of the Year nominees includes the most-followed Twitch streamer with 20 million followers, Kai Cenat.A mix of 70% fan votes and 30% industry panellists decide the winners.In November, Blaire faced accusations from viewers claiming certain popular streamers were blocked from particular categories for being too \"problematic\" - which she denied.Clips of the streamer tearfully replying to criticisms of the event soon spread online.\"I think I need to respond less\", she said.\"But as a human, you just want to be understood\".The constant ebb and flow of streamer \"drama\" which many content creators like Blaire experience is one of the reasons she finds the job tough - but she said it was also why she started the awards.\"For me, it's really important to bring people together, because I do think there's lots of toxicity on the internet,\" she said. \"And if people were just able to have a dinner together or reach across the board, it makes a big difference.\"For one night of the year, the negativity is silent\".",

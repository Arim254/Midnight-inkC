    "body": "9 hours agoCaroline HawleyDiplomatic CorrespondentTelegramFootage shared on social media showed protesters breaking the gate of the governor's office in FasaProtesters in Iran have tried to break into a local government building in the southern province of Fars, on a fourth day of demonstrations sparked by a currency collapse.Officials said three police officers were injured and four people arrested in the city of Fasa.Confrontations were also been reported in the western provinces of Hamedan and Lorestan.The authorities in the capital, Tehran, had declared Wednesday a bank holiday - in an apparent effort to quell the unrest.In video that emerged on social media and was verified by the BBC, a crowd is filmed breaking the gate of the governor's office in Fasa.Then, in another post, security men are seen shooting in response. Clouds of tear gas rise in front of shuttered shops.Across the country, schools, universities and public institutions were closed because of the last-minute public holiday announced by the Iranian government.It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.They began in Tehran on Sunday - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterDowning StreetPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised to \"defeat the decline and division offered by others\" in his new year message, as he insisted 2026 would see people feel \"positive change\" in their lives.He acknowledged \"things have been tough in Britain for a while\" but said the public should now start to see improvements including lower bills, more police on the streets and new health hubs.It has been a difficult year for the PM, who has been battling slowing economic growth, poor poll ratings and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.In her own new year message, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said 2025 had seen \"no growth, higher taxes and record unemployment\".However, she added that Britain was \"not destined for decline\" and her party's plan would \"back business and fix our economy so we can fund our armed forces, police, schools, NHS and build something that we feel proud of\".Sir Keir said he shared \"the frustration about the pace of change\" but \"the challenges we face were decades in the making, and renewal is not an overnight job\".He added: \"By staying the course, we will defeat the decline and division offered by others.\"The PM promised that over the next year \"things start to feel easier\", pointing to frozen rail fares, prescription charges and fuel duty, as well as increases to the minimum wage.\"In 2026, the choices we've made will mean more people will begin to feel positive change in your bills, your communities and your health service,\" he said.\"But even more people will feel once again a sense of hope, a belief that things can and will get better, feel that the promise of renewal can become a reality, and my government will make it that reality.\"The Liberal Democrats and Reform UK look forward to May's local elections in their new year messages.Both parties are hoping to make gains in the polls, which cover the Scottish parliament and the Welsh Senedd as well as thousands of council seats in England and a handful of directly elected mayoralties.Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party could \"win again in 2026\" after \"our record-breaking success\" in the last local elections.He vowed to \"stop Trump's America becoming Farage's Britain\" and \"change our country for the better\".Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, whose party has been consistently leading in national opinion polls since the spring, said his party was offering \"hope\" and \"change\", as he predicted May would be \"the single most important set of elections between now and the next general election\".He said the country was getting \"gloomier\" and \"poorer\", with higher unemployment and debt \"running completely out of control\".Farage criticised both Labour and the Conservatives for not understanding the \"new world\" of cryptocurrencies, AI and digital assets, which he described as \"the technologies of growth\".In his new year message, SNP leader John Swinney said the last year had been \"difficult\" for some, with \"conflict and upheaval\" across the world. The first minister said he would be \"toasting Scotland's famous win against Denmark\" to qualify for the World Cup, as well as looking forward to the competition over the summer and the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSir Keir Starmer will attempt to fix relationships with voters and \"woo MPs\" with a push to cut cost of living in 2026, the Guardian reports, ahead of a speech by the prime minister in the coming days. His reported plans are accompanied by Sydney's dazzling fireworks display \"as the world rings in the new year\".Another message from Sir Keir that \"2026 will be better\" leads the Daily Mirror, as the PM promises to deliver change after a \"tough year\". Above, Queen Camilla meets with the Hunt family, whose family members were murdered in 2024. The paper reports that their story inspired Camilla to open up about her experience of an indecent assault as a teenager.The Daily Mail enters the new year by leading on \"Digital IDs for babies\" that it says are a \"sinister new plan\" ministers have been privately discussing. Newborns could be allocated digital IDs \"along with the 'red book' of health records given to parents\", the paper writes, as part of an expansion of the digital ID scheme introduced by Sir Keir. The Independent features Sydney's world-famous fireworks in its top slot while mentioning that \"images of a menorah were projected on the Harbour Bridge\" to pay tribute to Bondi Beach attack victims. The lead story focuses on the HS2 project being accused of spending \"£37m of taxpayers' money buying up homes\" on an axed part of the line. Smiles and sunshine feature on the front page of the Daily Telegraph as British national Molly Taylor-South enters the New Year early in Sydney. Elsewhere, the home secretary vows to \"fight European judges\" over Shamima Begum. The European Court of Human Rights has reportedly formally challenged Britain's decision to strip Begum of her citizenship in 2019, the paper writes, after she \"ran off to Syria\" to join the Islamic State group.Parents could lose support for their children living with \"moderate mental health and development needs\" due to cost-cutting plans, the Times reports.The \"big freeze begins\" across the UK in the new year, as the i Paper informs readers of health and travel alerts. Yellow weather warnings have been issued for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the paper reports, while the Health and Security Agency reminds people to \"check on vulnerable friends\".Dame Esther Rantzen asks the public to write to peers who oppose the assisted dying bill to \"stop millions more suffering\", the Daily Express reports. Last year, MPs narrowly backed proposed legislation which would introduce assisted dying in England and Wales, in an historic House of Commons vote. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is withdrawing National Guard troops from several US cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles, after a Supreme Court ruling last week undermined his authority to use troops for policing. \"We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on New Year's Eve.Earlier on Tuesday, the Trump administration withdrew its legal attempts to keep control of troops deployed in LA. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump could not use troops in Chicago for domestic law enforcement.Trump's statement also mentioned Portland, Oregon, but not Washington DC, where troops remain on patrol.Trump decision to order the deployment of National Guard troops to Democratic-run cities set off a series of legal cases challenging his authority to do so. The troops are normally under the authority of state governors. Hundreds of troops had been sent to Chicago and Portland, but had not yet been assigned to patrol city streets, as the legal challenges played out in court.Trump has said the troops are needed to enforce the law and crackdown on crime and illegal immigration. Critics deny that the troops are necessary, and accuse Trump of attempting an \"authoritarian\" crackdown, which threatens democracy.The Supreme Court ruled last week in Trump v Illinois that the president did not have the authority to send troops into Chicago. Earlier on Tuesday, the Trump administration withdrew a legal motion in California, seeking to keep the troops under Trump's control. California Governor Gavin Newsom praised the move, posting on X: \"This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end.\"He said Trump's announcement of a troop withdrawal from US cities \"is the political version of 'you can't fire me, I quit.'\"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson praised the Supreme Court ruling last week, saying telling MS Now \"there is at least another branch of government that recognises that the overreach by the president is a real threat to our democracy\".",

    "body": "A worker at Walt Disney World is \"recovering\" after being injured by a 400-lb (180kg) runaway fake boulder prop in an incident that was caught on video, the Florida theme park confirmed. The incident took place at the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! during a live recreation of a famous scene from the film.Video shows the boulder rolling towards the audience as a staff member jumps into its path, preventing it from reaching the crowd.\"We're focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering,\" Disney said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Safety is at the heart of what we do, and that element of the show will be modified as our safety team completes a review of what happened.\"The scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark shows Indiana Jones - played by Harrison Ford - outrunning a giant boulder triggered by a booby trap, before leaping to safety.Video of the incident on Tuesday shows the boulder bouncing off its tracks, and then bounding towards the audience as a staff member steps into its path and is knocked to the ground.The staff member did not appear to stand up immediately, and other workers are seen running to his side.According to a blog run by the park, the boulder prop is approximately 400-lbs and made of rubber. A spokesperson for Disney did not confirm that the boulder was the cause of the incident, but told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that \"a prop moved off its track\".One witness told People magazine that the worker had \"saved\" the audience from being injured. \"It was a crazy experience and definitely one that we will remember.\"In one video of the incident, a man behind the camera is heard saying: \"He literally saved our lives, that guy.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick ThorpeCentral Europe correspondentBulgaria - the poorest country in the European Union - has become the 21st member of the eurozone - leapfrogging more obvious and prosperous candidates like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.For mostly urban, young and entrepreneurial Bulgarians, it's an optimistic and  potentially lucrative leap - the final move in a game which has brought Bulgaria into the European mainstream - from Nato and EU membership, to joining the Schengen zone, and now the euro.For the older, rural, more conservative parts of the population, the replacement of the Bulgarian lev by the euro provokes fear and resentment.The lev - meaning lion - has been the Bulgarian currency since 1881, but it has been pegged to other European currencies since 1997 - first the Deutschmark, then the euro.Opinion polls put Bulgaria's 6.5 million population more or less equally divided on the new currency, and political turmoil is not making the transition easy. Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government lost a confidence vote on 11 December, after mass protests against the 2026 budget. Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. \"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.",

    "body": "5 hours agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterYoung children from struggling families in some parts of England will be offered vaccinations at home to protect them from preventable diseases, the health secretary has said.The pilot scheme, announced on Thursday as part of a drive to increase vaccine uptake, will see health visitors trained to spend more time with small numbers of families who could fall through the cracks of the NHS.Wes Streeting told the BBC that children's healthcare had not been given the priority it deserved.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said it was \"a national scandal\" that more than half a million children faced long waits to access health services in England.In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Streeting said he was \"shocked\" by what he described as a lack of focus on children's health when he was in opposition.\"As human beings, it is in our nature to prioritise children. You talk to the overwhelming majority of parents, good parents, they will take bullets for their children,\" the health secretary said.\"There is that kind of innate sense of 'I will do everything I can to protect my child'. I don't think that's reflected sufficiently in the state,\" he added.The pilot scheme was part of that aim, he said, targeting families who are not signed up to a GP surgery or face language barriers, travel costs or childcare issues which stop them getting to a doctor.Uptake of childhood vaccines has declined over the past 10 years - no jabs met the 95% coverage target for children aged five and below, according to the latest data.Twelve areas in London, the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire, the North West, and South West will test the approach over the next year.The government said all other families should continue to have children vaccinated at their local surgery.Streeting said there had been a decline in the number of health visitors and community nursing over a number of years, and that government was developing a workforce plan to address recruitment.Health visitors are registered nurses or midwives who have additional training in community public health nursing. They work with families with a child aged five and under to identify health needs.In response to Streeting's comments, the Conservatives accused Labour of having \"no plan for children's health or the health service as a whole\". \"Labour are trying to distract from their dismal failures by pointing the finger at the last government,\" shadow health secretary Stuart Andrew said.Professor Steve Turner, President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, welcomed the plan and called on the health secretary to \"right the wrongs of the past\".Addressing NHS waiting times, he said it was now a \"matter of routine\" that children were not being seen by health professionals within the NHS's 18-week target, adding that he was \"particularly astounded\" that a quarter of children wait more than a year for community treatment, compared with just 1% of adults.\"Long waits for community and elective care are unacceptable at any age, but this is especially true for children where delays can cause irreversible and lifelong harm if care isn't provided during critical developmental windows,\" Prof Turner said.He added that the unequal treatment of adults and children \"must end\" by tackling obesity, protecting mental health, reducing exposure to nicotine and boosting vaccinations in children.Children up to the age of six across the UK are to be offered vaccine protection against chickenpox free on the NHS from January 2026.",

    "body": "The government has failed in its attempt to block a challenge against its decision to ban Palestine Action under terrorism laws.In a highly significant ruling, the Court of Appeal paved the way for the review of the ban before a High Court judge next month.The co-founder of Palestine Action, Huda Ammori, had won permission earlier this year for that judicial review of the Home Secretary's ban.Ministers then tried to stop the hearing from going ahead, arguing that Parliament had set out a specific and alternative process for appealing against banning orders.The ban, which started on 5 July, makes membership of, or support for, the direct action group a criminal offence.More than 2,100 people have been arrested in demonstrations since the group was banned. During those protests, they have held up signs reading \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\". Some 170 of the protesters have been charged with allegedly showing support for the group, which can lead to six months in jail.Under terrorism laws, any group that is banned by ministers can ask to be \"deproscribed\" through a complicated internal review by the Home Office. That process that can take months to complete.If ministers decide the ban should still remain in force, the order can be reconsidered by judges in a special semi-secret court, the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission (POAC).This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "1 hour agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterThe BBC has confirmed it will go ahead with broadcasting the latest series of Celebrity MasterChef, featuring sacked co-presenter John Torode.Torode was sacked in the summer after an allegation against him using \"an extremely offensive racist term\" was upheld. He has said he has \"no recollection\" of it.In a statement on Friday, the BBC said it had not been a \"straightforward decision\" but that all of the celebrities, contestants and guests involved had confirmed they were happy for the shows to be aired.Two Christmas specials will also be aired, the corporation confirmed on Friday.The latest series of Celebrity MasterChef was recorded earlier this year.It was fronted by Torode and food critic Grace Dent, who stepped in after BBC News first revealed separate allegations against former host Gregg Wallace.Wallace has said he was \"deeply sorry for any distress\" he caused but that \"none of the serious allegations against me were upheld\" by a report conducted by production company Banijay.The same report also upheld a claim against Torode of using a severely offensive racist term.Both presenters were sacked in July.The BBC decided to go ahead and still show this year's amateur series of MasterChef, with both Wallace and Torode in it, for the sake of the chefs who had taken part in it.The corporation has now confirmed that Celebrity MasterChef, featuring 15 stars, will also be aired from this autumn.Those taking part include rugby star Alun Wyn Jones, TV personality Chris Hughes, author and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter, gladiator Jodie Ounsley, and pop star Michelle Heaton.\"Banijay UK has consulted the celebrities, contestants and guests featured and all have confirmed that they are happy for the shows to be aired,\" a BBC spokesperson said.\"As we have said previously, these are not straightforward decisions. We have approached this with care and consideration for all involved and we appreciate not everyone will agree with us.\"",

    "body": "Baek Se-hee, the South Korean author of the bestselling memoir I Want to Die but I Want To Eat Tteokbokki has died at the age of 35.Her 2018 book, a compilation of conversations with her psychiatrist about her depression, was a cultural phenomenon with its themes of mental health resonating with readers across the world.Originally written in Korean, it found international acclaim after its English translation was published in 2022.The details surrounding her death are unclear.Baek donated her organs - her heart, lungs, liver and kidneys - which have helped to save five lives, the Korean Organ Donation Agency said in a statement on Friday.The statement also included comments from her sister, which said that Baek had wanted to \"share her heart with others through her work, and to inspire hope\".I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki, published in 2018, has sold more than a million copies worldwide and been translated in 25 countries.The runaway bestseller was celebrated for normalising mental health conversations and its nuanced take on inner struggles - most notably, the author's personal conflict between depressive thoughts and her appreciation for simple joys.\"The human heart, even when it wants to die, quite often wants at the same time to eat some tteokbokki, too,\" goes the book's most famous line. Tteokbokki, which are tubular chewy rice cakes usually eaten with a spicy sauce or stew, is a popular snack in Korean cuisine.Born in 1990, Baek Se-hee took creative writing in university and worked for five years at a publishing house, according to her short biography on Bloomsbury Publishing, which produced the English version of her 2018 memoir.Anton Hur, who had translated Baek's book into English, wrote on Instagram that her organs have saved five people but \"her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing\".\"My thoughts are with her family,\" he wrote.For a decade she received treatment for dysthymia, a mild but long-lasting type of depression, which formed the basis of her bestseller, said her Bloomsbury bio.A sequel, I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki, was published in Korean in 2019. Its English translation was published in 2024.Tributes have poured in on social media. \"Rest softly,\" reads a comment on Baek's Instagram page. \"Thank you for saving us with your honesty.\"Another Instagram user said each time they read Baek's memoir they found \"deep comfort in every sentence and grew alongside it\". \"To create a single book that can lift people up... is no easy task, and I have indescribable respect for you for achieving that,\" they wrote.A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.

    "body": "53 minutes agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterPA MediaStephen Parkinson has been criticial of Sir Keir Starmer's time as head of the CPSThe director of public prosecutions is facing mounting pressure to further explain the collapse of a case against two men accused of spying for China.MPs are demanding Stephen Parkinson give a \"fuller explanation\" of why charges against parliamentary researcher Christopher Cash, 30, and academic Christopher Berry, 33, were dropped last month. Both men deny the allegations.Parkinson has blamed the collapse of the case on a failure by the government to provide enough evidence showing China was a threat to the UK's national security.But calls for clarification have grown after the government published witness statements on Wednesday outlining the threat posed by Beijing.The chairs of four parliamentary committees have given Mr Parkinson, the boss of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), until Friday next week to answer a series of questions about why the case collapsed.He is also likely to hauled before MPs to give evidence, with a joint national security committee of MPs and peers also launching a formal inquiry.Labour MP Matt Western, who chairs the committee, said there were \"many questions yet to be answered\" by both Mr Parkinson and the government.Western added that the committee would hope to hear from \"the government and officials\" as soon as possible. Another parliamentary group, the intelligence and security committee, has launched a separate probe into how classified material was used during the case.Witness statementsMr Cash and Mr Berry were charged last year under the 1911 Official Secrets Act, accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.This legislation requires prosecutors to prove that suspects have passed on material that could be \"directly or indirectly useful to an enemy\".In a letter to MPs last week, Mr Parkinson said a court ruling in a separate case following the charges meant this included countries deemed to pose a \"threat to the national security of the UK\" at the time of the alleged offences.He added that CPS lawyers had dropped the case after failing to obtain sufficient evidence from the government describing China to this effect.It prompted a row with ministers, with Sir Keir Starmer saying he was \"deeply disappointed\" the prosecutions did not go ahead and taking the unusual step of publishing government witness statements given to the CPS.The three statements, written by deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, are clear that the Chinese are carrying out spying operations against the UK.In the documents, he said China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" against the UK and was \"the biggest state-based threat to the country's economic security\".Criticism of StarmerMr Parkinson met senior MPs on Wednesday, and is reported to have told them the government's evidence fell \"5%\" short of what would have been required to stand a chance of getting a conviction. But some MPs have continued to question why the CPS did not deem it had enough evidence to continue the case.It has thrust Mr Parkinson, who was appointed director of public prosecutions in September 2023 under the previous Conservative government, into the heart of an abnormally public row with ministers.The episode is especially unusual because Mr Parkinson is himself a successor to Sir Keir, with the prime minister having led the CPS between 2013 and 2018, before he first entered Parliament two years later.A former senior partner at law firm Kingsley Napley, Parkinson initially trained as a barrister before switching to become a solicitor in 2005.Before his appointment as director of public prosecutions, he had been critical of Sir Keir's own time in the role, describing the now-prime minister as \"an average DPP\" in a May 2023 interview with The Times.He was quoted as saying the Labour leader \"was over-reliant on advice given by others; he had no in-depth experience of prosecuting… he was a defence and human rights lawyer\". In an interview in April, Mr Parkinson described how he had initially not applied to university due to poor predicted grades, before deciding to reconsider after his actual results turned out to be better than expected.He took a year out to apply to study law, during which he worked as a dustman, on a kibbutz and as a ballpoint pen salesman in South Africa.",

    "body": "Family of British girl missing for 55 years gives ultimatum to person of interest6 hours agoKaty WatsonAustralia correspondentGrimmer familyCheryl Grimmer vanished from a beach in New South Wales in 1970The family of a British girl who disappeared in Australia more than 50 years ago has threatened to name a key person of interest unless he comes forward to answer their questions.Authorities believe three-year-old Cheryl Grimmer was abducted from Fairy Meadow beach in Wollongong in January 1970.A suspect was charged with her abduction and murder, but his 2019 trial collapsed after a detailed confession, made when he was a teenager, was ruled inadmissible. He denies any wrongdoing.Known only as Mercury, the man's identity is protected as he was a minor at the time, but a politician has offered to name him under parliamentary privilege as the family pushes for a fresh investigation.\"[Mercury]'s got until Wednesday night,\" Cheryl's brother Ricki Nash told reporters on Friday.Jeremy Buckingham, a New South Wales parliamentarian who has been supporting the Grimmer family, said he's prepared to use parliamentary privilege to name the man when state parliament resumes sitting on Thursday.Mr Nash wants Mercury to explain to the family how he knew information contained in his confession - and if it was true or not.\"Enough is enough,\" he said, at times on the verge of tears. \"We want the truth to come out.\"Cheryl had been on the beach at Fairy Meadow with her family on 12 January 1970. When the family decided to pack up, Mr Nash, as the eldest brother, had been put in charge of his siblings and told to go to the bathroom block.Cheryl ran giggling into the ladies' changing rooms and refused to come out. Too embarrassed to enter himself, Mr Nash went back to the beach to tell his mother to help. When they returned, 90 seconds later, the toddler was gone.The family had only recently migrated to Australia from Bristol as so-called Ten Pound Poms.Despite extensive searches, there were no leads. Then in 2017, a man in his 60s was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder after officers discovered a confession made to police by a teenage boy in 1971.A judge later ruled the confession could not be presented as trial evidence and the charges against him were dropped.On Friday, the family released a lengthy document detailing the missteps they say were made by authorities in NSW in the search for Cheryl, and called for more answers.ABC News/Kelly FullerRicki Nash is pushing for a fresh investigation into his sister's disappearance\"We've made various requests to NSW authorities for a fresh prosecution or a fresh inquest but to no avail,\" the family said in the letter.\"We feel that we have been fobbed off numerous times by the police, saying that they're conducting reviews of the case or exploring leads that make no sense to us. The incompetence and negligence in the NSW police investigation of this case over much of the past 55 years is unfathomable.\"NSW Police have defended their conduct, reiterating that homicide detectives are still investigating Cheryl's disappearance - and that a A$1m reward for information remains on offer.\"Police continue to examine every line of inquiry and search for answers into Cheryl's death,\" NSW Police said in a statement.Three potential eyewitnesses came forward after the BBC aired the Fairy Meadow true crime podcast in 2022, which has since been downloaded five million times. Their contacts were passed on to investigators.But the family was recently told that a four-year-long review of the case found there was no new evidence that could lead to a conviction - even though the new potential eyewitnesses were not formally interviewed by officers.The family, alongside a volunteer team using cadaver detection dogs, also searched an \"area of interest\" they hoped would be a breakthrough in the case earlier this month. But police said that a subsequent search of the area only found animal bones.Cheryl's family disputes the police's response and said volunteers were back in the area on Friday, collecting soil samples to be sent to the UK and the US for further analysis.\"Cheryl disappeared more than 55 years ago. It's time for answers, it's time for accountability,\" the family said.It comes as the NSW parliament announced an inquiry into long-term missing persons cases in the state - including Cheryl's. It will look into how investigations have been carried out and ways of improvement.",

    "body": "7 minutes agoBen KingBusiness reporterGetty ImagesThe UK's stock market has fallen sharply after a warning from two US banks triggered a widespread sell-off in global shares.Two US regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank, said on Thursday that they had been hit by either bad or fraudulent loans, sparking fears of problems in the banking sector.Some of the UK's biggest banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered saw their share prices fall more than 5%. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares had dropped about 1.5% at one point before regaining some ground.Stock market indexes around the world, including Germany's Dax and the Cac 40 in France, also fell.On Thursday, Zions Bank said it would write off a $50m loss on two loans, while Western Alliance disclosed it had started a lawsuit alleging fraud.\"Pockets of the US banking sector including regional banks have given the market cause for concern,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\"Investors have started to question why there have been a plethora of issues in a short space of time and whether this points to poor risk management and loose lending standards.\"\"Investors have been spooked,\" he added, saying that while there was no evidence of any issues with UK-listed banks, \"investors often have a knee-jerk reaction when problems appear anywhere in the sector\".Bank shares in Europe were also hit, with Germany's Deutsche Bank down more than 5% and France's Societe Generale dropping 4%.Asian markets fell earlier on Friday. Japan's Nikkei index closed down 1.4% and in Hong Kong the Hang Seng Index ended the day 2.5% lower.Investors have been nervous following the failure of two high-profile US firms, car loan company Tricolor and car parts maker First Brands. These failures have raised questions about the quality of deals in what is known as the private credit market - where companies arrange loans from non-bank lenders.This week Jamie Dimon, the boss of the US's largest bank JPMorgan Chase, warned that these two failures could be a sign of more to come. \"My antenna goes up when things like that happen,\" he told analysts. \"I probably shouldn't say this, but when you see one cockroach, there are probably more. Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\" In addition, there have also been warnings that the surge in artificial intelligence investment has produced a bubble in the US stock market - including from Mr Dimon - leading to fears that shares are overvalued.The market turbulence on Friday saw the price of gold reach a fresh record high of $4,380 per ounce, as investors looked for safe havens for their money. Another closely watched measure of market nerves, the VIX volatility index sometimes called the \"Fear Index\", hit its highest level since April. ",

Nazi-worshipping extremists convicted of terror offences have been jailed.Christopher Ringrose, 34, Marco Pitzettu, 25, and Brogan Stewart, 25, were found guilty in May of planning terrorist attacks on mosques and synagogues.Stewart, from West Yorkshire, was jailed for 11 years, Ringrose, from Staffordshire, was jailed for 10 years, and Pitzettu, from Derbyshire, will serve eight years.Sentencing them at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday, Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed they all continued to adhere to their extreme right-wing ideology.The judge outlined how the online group the trio belonged to was preparing for an attack on an Islamic education centre in Leeds before they were arrested by counter-terror police.During their trial it emerged the men, who are not believed to have met in the real world before appearing in court, were preparing to use more than 200 weapons they had amassed, including machetes, swords, crossbows and an illegal stun gun.Ringrose had also 3D-printed most of the components of a semi-automatic firearm.Prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC said the three defendants were \"followers of an extreme right-wing Nazi ideology\" and styled themselves as an armed military group.Counter Terrorism Policing North EastThe trio had amassed a cache of weapons as part of their planningMr Sandiford said by 2024 they were seeking further recruits and hoping to acquire more deadly weapons.He said by January and February they were planning their first attack and had identified a target in Leeds, harbouring an \"intention to commit acts of extremism which involved killing multiple victims\".The three men were arrested when security services believed an attack was imminent after undercover officers infiltrated their online group.A jury had rejected arguments the defendants were fantasists with no intention of carrying out their threats and found all three guilty of a charge of preparing acts of terrorism and charges of collecting information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.Ringrose was also convicted of manufacturing a prohibited weapon.'Vile views'Counter-terror police said the self-styled \"militant\" online group provided an \"echo chamber of extreme right-wing views where they shared horrific racial slurs, glorified mass murderers and encouraged violence against anyone deemed an enemy\".Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East Det Ch Supt James Dunkerley said they were a group who \"espoused vile racist views and advocated for violence, all to support their extreme right-wing mindset\".\"Some of their defence in court was that it was all fantasy or just part of harmless chat, however all three took real-world steps to plan and prepare for carrying out an attack on innocent citizens.\"He said it had been a complex case involving multiple police forces.Bethan David, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's Counter Terrorism Division, said the men plotted \"violent acts of terrorism\".\"By their own admission, they were inspired by SS tactics and supremacist ideology.\"The prosecution case against the defendants included their disturbing Telegram and Facebook chats as well as acquiring military equipment such as riot shields, body armour and an arsenal of weapons found at their home addresses that were to be used in readiness for a 'race war'.\"In her sentencing, Mrs Justice Cutts said she believed the defendants would be dangerous on their release from jail and gave all three extended sentences, with additional licence periods of eight years for Stewart and five years each for Ringrose and Pitzettu.She said the trio's ideology was \"laid bare\" in a 374-page dossier of internet activity put before the jury.\"These pages were filled with hate towards black and other non-white races, especially Muslim people and immigrants, with ideas of white supremacy and racial purity together with a belief that there must soon be a race war.\"This was coupled, she said, with the \"glorification and admiration of the policies and actions of Hitler and the German Nazi Party, including antisemitism, and of mass killers who had targeted black or Muslim communities\".Counter Terrorism Policing North EastWeapons were found after searches of the men's homesThe nine-week-long trial heard how the defendants formed an online group called Einsatz 14 in January 2024, with \"like-minded extremists\" who wanted to \"go to war for their chosen cause\".The jury was shown a short video Stewart posted of himself wearing a German army helmet, a Nazi armband and a skull face covering.Prosecutors explained how Stewart discussed torturing a Muslim leader using his \"information extraction kit\" with an undercover officer.Stewart called himself \"Fuhrer\" of the Einsatz 14 group and appointed an undercover officer called Blackheart as the \"Obergruppenfuhrer\", which the other two defendants also joined.Potential recruits were sent a vetting form and Stewart also developed a mission statement for the group which said its \"basic duties\" included to \"target mosques, Islamic education centres and other similar locations\".And he sent Blackheart details of the Islamic education centre on Mexborough Road in Leeds, including a Google Maps image.The officer asked Stewart for more detailed information about the plan and he replied that they could smash windows or ambush someone, the court heard.All three men will be subject to a Serious Crime Prevention Order for five years on release and to Terrorism Notification Requirements for 30 years.Additional reporting by PA MediaMore on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Strange shrieks as tensions rise in Celebrity Traitors14 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterThe Celebrity Traitors: Could you guess this clue?Spoiler warning: This article reveals details from the fourth episode of The Celebrity TraitorsThe latest episode of The Celebrity Traitors has taken place, and all we're talking about is which celebrity can shriek the best.During a challenge, the contestants - including Alan Carr, Celia Imrie and Lucy Beaumont - were tasked with asking a group of banshees to sing, before relaying the songs down a well.It was weird, and off-the-wall. But for many social media users, it was the subtitles that stole the show.\"Celia shrieks strangely,\" read one, while another said: \"They repeat the wail.\"\"The people responsible for the subtitles deserve a raise,\" wrote one X user.Singer Charlotte Church was, unsurprisingly, the most impressive. Meanwhile, Imrie's efforts - and facial expressions - won her more love online, with one calling her \"the funniest person to have ever existed\".The subtitles during the challenge left many fans in hystericsThere was also a rare moment where presenter Claudia Winkleman's mask appeared to slip, as national treasure Sir Stephen Fry plunged his head into the well.\"Oh no, Stephen Fry is in the water, I can't look\" she said, covering her eyes.\"I'm a grown man, what the hell am I doing,\" said Sir Stephen after he emerged, in a quote that could sum up the entire series.Elsewhere, the celebrities' continued inability to pick out a Traitor was the other big talking point of the night.\"They're hopeless, absolutely hopeless,\" said TV critic Toby Earle.TV sports presenter Clare Balding became the latest celebrity to be banished from the castle.The 54-year-old received seven votes from her fellow contestants during Thursday's episode, before revealing she was in fact a faithful.\"What are the odds of us being so useless,\" said Sir Stephen, while Winkleman urged the celebrities to do better. \"Stop being so polite,\" she told them.Other faithfuls - YouTube star Niko Omilana, and actress Tameka Empson - were both already voted out at previous roundtables.The younger celebs are being murdered and banished at a rapid paceEarlier in the episode, another of the younger celebrities - actress Ruth Codd, 29 - was murdered by the traitors.Codd had won fans with her cutting one-liners, and there was sadness on social media to see her go. \"Icon down,\" wrote one X user.Her murder comes after she raised her suspicions about TV presenter Jonathan Ross being a traitor during Wednesday's episode.Fellow traitor Cat Burns warned that \"it could backfire on you\" to remove his prime suspect, but Ross replied: \"Look, if I was a traitor, I wouldn't have done that.\"The words \"double bluff\" and \"double double bluff\" were bandied around throughout the episode - but in the end, Ross survived to tell the tale.\"How am I still here. I've got to be the luckiest traitor in the history of the game,\" Ross wondered.Murder, betrayal and lies - why we're attracted to The Traitors' dark sideOther highlights from the show included Ross's leopard cardigan, which Balding likened to a \"Flintstones outfit\".Meanwhile, comedian Alan Carr continues his transformation “from giggly liability to cold-hearted killer,” said TV critic Earle.\"Let's get rid of her now before she poisons everyone,\" Carr declared about poor Codd.Lucy Beaumont wondered whether her height may be a disadvantage. Sir Stephen is \"too tall\" for her to see his eyes and suss out his motives, she says - although she can tell you if his flies are undone.And finally, Fartgate hasn't gone away. At one point, the celebrities were playing badminton, and Carr shouted out to Imrie: \"Celia, we need a bit of wind to get it over the net.\"She replied: \"Oh, shut up.\"The Celebrity Traitors is on BBC One on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:00 BST and on BBC iPlayer. There will be nine episodes.",

    "body": "Housing designed to combat loneliness wins top architecture award14 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPhilip Vile/RibaA modern answer to the traditional almshouse, designed to combat loneliness, has won a prestigious architecture award for Britain's best new building.Appleby Blue Almshouse, which provides affordable flats for over-65s in Southwark, south London, has won this year's Royal Institute of British Architects' (Riba) Stirling Prize.The complex, in Bermondsey, has 59 flats plus communal facilities, including a roof garden, courtyard and community kitchen.The Stirling Prize judges said it \"sets an ambitious standard for social housing among older people\".Philip Vile/RibaArchitects Witherford Watson Mann have crafted \"high-quality\" and \"thoughtful\" spaces to create environments that truly care for their residents\", according to jury member Ingrid Schroder, director of the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture.Philip Vile/RibaThe building was praised for its \"generous\" homes, terracotta-paved hallways with benches and plants, and a water feature that gives the building the \"sense of a woodland oasis\".That all creates an \"aspirational living environment\" that stands \"in stark contrast to the institutional atmosphere often associated with older people's housing\", Riba said.Philip Vile/RibaThe Appleby Blue Almshouse was built on the site of an old care home by United St Saviour's Charity, which subsidises the flats for people on low incomes.Almshouses were traditionally built from the Middle Ages to provide charitable accommodation for people in need.Philip Vile/RibaAppleby Blue beat a range of other nominated buildings and architecture projects to this year's Stirling Prize, ranging from the restoration of the Big Ben tower in London to a new fashion college campus, a science laboratory and an \"inventive\" home extension.The other contenders were:House of CommonsRory GaylorThe Elizabeth TowerHastings HouseThe prize is given to the building judged to be \"the most significant of the year for the evolution of architecture and the built environment\", and is judged on criteria including design vision, innovation and originality.This is Witherford Watson Mann's second time as winning architects, 12 years after they were selected for their design for a groundbreaking modern holiday home inside the ancient Astley Castle in Warwickshire.The Elizabeth line - London's east-west train line - won the prestigious award last year.Other previous winners of the prize - first presented in 1996 - include Liverpool's Everyman Theatre, Hastings Pier and the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh.Sign up here to receive our weekly newsletter highlighting uplifting stories and remarkable people from around the world.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoIan YoungsCulture reporterEPAThe BBC committed a \"serious breach\" of broadcasting rules by failing to disclose that the narrator of a documentary about Gaza was the son of a Hamas official, UK media regulator Ofcom has ruled.An Ofcom investigation into Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone has concluded that the programme was \"materially misleading\".The BBC's director general has previously apologised, saying there had been \"a significant failing in relation to accuracy\".Ofcom has ordered the BBC to broadcast a prime-time statement about its conclusions.\"As this represents a serious breach of our rules, we are directing the BBC to broadcast a statement of our findings against it on BBC2 at 21:00, with a date to be confirmed,\" it said.It is the first time the BBC has received a sanction from Ofcom and been ordered to make an on-air apology since 2009.BBC/Amjad Al Fayoumi/Hoyo FilmsThe documentary centred on the 13-year-old son of Hamas's deputy minister of agricultureThe documentary centred on a 13-year-old son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture.Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others.Ofcom's statement said: \"Our investigation found that the programme's failure to disclose that the narrator's father held a position in the Hamas-run administration was materially misleading.\"It meant that the audience did not have critical information which may have been highly relevant to their assessment of the narrator and the information he provided.\"Trust is at the heart of the relationship between a broadcaster and its audience, particularly for a public service broadcaster such as the BBC.\"This failing had the potential to erode the significantly high levels of trust that audiences would have placed in a BBC factual programme about the Israel-Gaza war.\"Misleading the audience is \"among the most serious\" breaches that can be committed by a broadcaster, it said.The on-air apology ordered by Ofcom is the regulator's first sanction on the BBC since the scandal over Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's comments to actor Andrew Sachs on Radio 2 in 2009.BBC accepts ruling 'in full'The documentary was pulled from iPlayer in February after the boy's family links emerged.In July, an internal review carried out by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston, found that the programme breached the corporation's editorial guidelines on accuracy.A BBC spokesperson said: \"The Ofcom ruling is in line with the findings of Peter Johnston's review, that there was a significant failing in the documentary in relation to the BBC's Editorial Guidelines on accuracy, which reflects Rule 2.2 of Ofcom's Broadcasting Code.\"We have apologised for this and we accept Ofcom's decision in full. We will comply with the sanction as soon as the date and wording are finalised.\"The BBC told the Ofcom investigation it had \"publicly acknowledged a serious breach in its own editorial standards\", and had \"undertaken to implement a series of measures to ensure future compliance with its own standards and those of the Ofcom Code\".'Very problematic' omission - OfcomOfcom's report said the narrator \"occupied a unique and prominent position in the programme, acting as a trusted guide to viewers\".\"Given the highly contested context of the Israel-Gaza war and the narrator's central role as the editorial voice of the programme and trusted guide to the viewer, we considered the omission of important information about his familial connection to the Hamas administration to be very problematic.\"It added: \"Had viewers been made aware of this information, they may have evaluated the commentary provided by the narrator in a substantially different manner.\"The programme was made for the BBC by an independent production company, Hoyo Films.In July, the BBC's review concluded that Hoyo Films bore most of the responsibility for the failure to make clear the boy's family links, but that the BBC bore some responsibility and should have done more in its oversight.However, Ofcom's report said it \"is clear that the BBC held editorial responsibility for the programme as broadcast\".It added: \"We considered the BBC's failure to carry out rigorous compliance checks and provide adequate editorial oversight of a documentary detailing the experiences of Palestinian people living through a highly contentious conflict resulted in a serious omission, which had the clear potential to mislead viewers.\"BBC review found 'no family influence'The BBC's internal review found that three members of the production company knew of the father's position in the Hamas-run government in Gaza, but no-one within the BBC knew this prior to broadcast.However, the BBC's report criticised the corporation's own team for not being \"sufficiently proactive\" with initial editorial checks, and for a \"lack of critical oversight of unanswered or partially answered questions\" ahead of broadcast.The review also said it had seen no evidence \"to support the suggestion that the narrator's father or family influenced the content of the programme in any way\".Hoyo Films said it takes Ofcom's findings \"extremely seriously and [we] apologise for the mistake that resulted in a breach of its code\".\"We are pleased that the ruling was in line with Peter Johnston's review, which found that there was no inappropriate influence on the content by any third party, it was impartial, fairly edited and all payments were legitimate.\"The documentary \"remains a vital account\" of the Gaza conflict, and the contributors \"deserve to have their voices heard\", the statement added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoAna FaguyWashington andAoife WalshGetty ImagesJohn Bolton, who served as Donald Trump's national security adviser before becoming a vocal critic of the president, has been criminally indicted on federal charges.The Department of Justice presented a case to a grand jury in Maryland on Thursday, and they agreed there was enough evidence to indict Bolton, who issued a statement maintaining his innocence.It comes after FBI agents searched Bolton's home and office in August as part of an investigation into the handling of classified information. The indictment makes Bolton, 76, the third of the US president's political opponents to face charges in recent weeks. He could face decades in prison.According to a 26-page indictment filed at a court in Greenbelt, Maryland, on Thursday, Bolton is charged with eight counts of transmission of national defence information (NDI) and 10 counts of unlawful retention of NDI.An indictment in the US justice system is a formal accusation issued by a grand jury - a group of members of the public set up by a prosecutor to review evidence to determine if a case should proceed.Prosecutors accuse Bolton of illegally transmitting top secret information about US national defence using his personal email and other messaging apps. \"These documents revealed intelligence about future attacks, foreign adversaries, and foreign-policy relations,\" the court papers state.Watch: \"That's the way it goes\", says Trump on John Bolton's indictmentIf found guilty, Bolton could face up to 10 years in prison for each charge. He is expected to surrender to authorities on Friday.\"No one is above the law,\" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the charges. Bolton said in a statement that he looked forward to defending his \"lawful conduct\" in court as he accused Trump of seeking \"retribution against me\".\"Now, I have become the latest target in weaponizing the Justice Department to charge those he [Trump] deems to be his enemies with charges that were declined before or distort the facts,\" Bolton said.Bolton's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said the charges stemmed from diary entries kept by his client over his 45-year career in public service. \"Like many public officials throughout history, Amb Bolton kept diaries – that is not a crime,\" said Mr Lowell. He described the records as \"unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021\".The indictment says Bolton shared \"more than a thousand pages of information about his day-to-day activities\", including information classified as top secret, with two relatives who are not named. He allegedly shared the information with his wife and daughter, according to US media reports. The unauthorised information includes \"diary-like entries from Bolton's time as the National Security Advisor\" and were allegedly \"printed and stored\" at Bolton's home in Bethesda, Maryland.The indictment also says that, at some point between September 2019 and July 2021, \"a cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran\" hacked his personal email account and gained access to the classified information.It says one of Bolton's representative told the FBI about the hack, but the agency was not warned the hackers might have gained access to sensitive information. Bolton was fired from Trump's first administration in 2019. His 2020 memoir, The Room Where It Happened, recounted his time working under Trump and portrayed him as a president who was ill-informed about geopolitics.The White House filed a lawsuit to block the book from being published, arguing it contained classified information and had not been properly vetted. A judge denied the request and the book was released days later.The US Department of Justice then opened an investigation into whether Bolton had mishandled classified information by disclosing certain information in the book. Court documents state that, while \"the initial manuscript contained significant amounts of highly classified information that needed to be removed\", the published version contained none covered by the indictment. Asked about the indictment on Thursday at the White House, Trump said he did not know about it, but added that Bolton was \"a bad guy\". Watch: How the FBI raids on John Bolton's home and office unfoldedBolton, who served as George W Bush's UN ambassador, was among former officials critical of Trump who had their Secret Service protection stripped in January.He is the third Trump critic to be criminally charged since September. New York City Attorney General Letitia James was indicted on bank fraud charges in October. Former FBI director James Comey was charged in late September with lying to Congress.The cases were filed after Trump urged the US attorney general to prosecute his political opponents.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" he wrote on social media.",

Pubs still number more than 40,000 and the 57-year-old is adamant that the pub cannot be beaten as a place for bringing people together.Speaking to the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast, the Greene King CEO is quick to reiterate the special status that pubs hold in the UK, emphasising that \"community\" is as much of a selling point as the beers, wines and spirits they sell.But can pubs, inextricably linked to  the sale of booze, entice the younger generation to their premises when the around one-third of under-25s and 20% of all Brits don't drink alcohol?Mackenzie makes a point of highlighting the no-alcohol beer on draught after nipping into the New Explorer pub, just off Oxford Street, even while pointing out that low- and no-alcohol pints still make up only a small share of overall sales.\"It means that if you don't drink, you can come to the pub, you can meet friends, you can do the things that everybody does in the pub,\" he says.\"My experience - and certainly from my own family - I know young people are still out going to pubs and drinking, but we are also having to adapt to trends around well-being.\"He says the \"coffee offer now is credible\" across Greene King's venues as the industry as a whole adapts to an environment where customers come in to have just a coffee or a meal.\"Pubs are creating environments that now are much more comfortable rather than feeling like [being] sat in a dingy pub. \"Not all pubs are like that, I know,\" he hastens to add.And although he isn't yet committing to on-trend iced matcha or pumpkin-spiced lattes, he says Greene King pubs are selling more hot drinks than ever before.The industry's trend away from drinks-led \"dingy pubs\" toward food-led gastro pubs has been in effect for a while. ONS data suggests the share of pub company staff working in kitchen-focused roles surpassed those behind the bar in 2014 and has increased ever since.More recently there has been an increase in the number of bars and pubs built around \"competitive socialising\", where dates or groups split time between the bar and games like crazy golf, shuffleboard or axe-throwing. That subset of hospitality has more than doubled from 280 bars and pubs pre-pandemic to around 600 now, according to data from estate agents Savills.Some Greene King pubs are now expanding into this area too. If the company is to lean into amusements at more pubs, then Mackenzie's CV may be an asset.Before Greene King he ran Merlin Entertainment, owner of Thorpe Park, Madame Tussauds and Legoland, which had a certain appeal to his two children.\"My kids benefited from that when they were younger — they had theme parks to go to. And when they hit 18, I got back into pubs, so they were quite happy about that too,\" he chuckles.BBC/Greene KingSpeaking ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Budget, Mackenzie says he is hoping for \"no surprises\" from it as the government looks to raise taxes to plug a multi-billion-pound shortfall in the country's finances.Hospitality and retail companies in particular bore the brunt of the chancellor's decision in last year's Budget to increase the amount employers pay for National Insurance per employee.His message to Reeves is: \"Give us some breathing space, but actually do the things that you said you were going to do in your manifesto about solving the business rates issue.\"Labour has pledged to reform the business rates system - a tax on commercial premises that can add millions of pounds in costs to companies on UK High Streets.\"This industry pays more tax than others, OK? And the business rate specifically is disproportionate. And governments have said they're going to change it... now they need to do it,\" says Mackenzie.A government spokesperson said pubs, restaurants and cafes were vital to local communities. \"That's why we're cutting the cost of licensing, lowering their business rates and helping more hospitality businesses offer pavement drinks and al fresco dining.\"Details on business rates reform are expected before the end of the year.The BBC is speaking to the bosses of some of the UK's biggest firms to find out the stories behind the people that lead them.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHarry CraigLondonBBCVarun lost his entire life savings after he was a victim of romance fraud on a dating appRomance fraud, a growing crime that targets both the heart and the pocket, saw an estimated £106m lost by UK victims in the past financial year.One of those who lost money and a romance was Varun Yadav, a London banker who hoped to find a life partner on a dating app.Now £40,000 poorer after being persuaded to invest in crypto trading, he said he saw the warning signs but was so emotionally attached he ignored his suspicions. When he realised what had happened, fear and shame kept him quiet.Action Fraud, which published the figures, said it can have a serious impact on victims, \"not just financially but emotionally, socially and even physically\".Mr Yadav thought he had met his ideal woman on a site called Jeevansathi, meaning \"life partner\" in Hindi.She said her name was Rekha Shah.After months of chatting over WhatsApp and video calls, she asked him if he would invest with her.Mr Yadav lost his life savings and left him feeling suicidal.\"You see all the signs, but you are so emotionally attached. You are willing to lose the money, but you are not willing to lose the connection,\" he told BBC Radio London.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said banks were missing opportunities to help break the spell of romance scams.Better detection and monitoring systems, identifying vulnerability early on, and compassionate aftercare would all improve outcomes for victims.Firms needed to train staff to spot red flags and critically probe customer explanations, it said.PA MediaRomance fraud involves fraudsters exploiting victims for money by gaining their trust and affection through the guise of a romantic relationshipMr Yadav's initial caution about a cryptocurrency platform called Deuncoin was assuaged by the fact he could withdraw money.Then he made a big loss, and \"Rekha Shah\" asked him to put in all his savings to recover the losses. Once done, he was suddenly unable to withdraw the funds, and he realised \"it was all one big scam\".\"I thought, I've lost everything. I've lost the person I thought was going to be my life partner, I've lost all my life savings.\"He said losing the money initially was a red flag but he \"ignored the signs because of the fear and the shame\".Getty ImagesRomance fraud involves fraudsters using a romantic relationship to exploit their victims for money by gaining their trust and affectionMr Yadav said he hoped sharing his story would help ensure others do not have to face what he went through alone.\"When I shared my story with my friends, a lot of them said they'd been part of a similar scam, but were too ashamed to say it.\"This is a trauma that will stay with me for life, but I've learnt coping mechanisms and rebuilt my life. There is hope.\"What is romance fraud?Romance fraud involves fraudsters creating fake online personas to gain someone's trust and affection through the guise of a romantic relationship, and ultimately exploiting them for money.They manipulate, persuade and exploit victims, often encouraging them to isolate themselves socially and requiring urgency and secrecy from the victim.Action Fraud, the national body for reporting such scams, has key tips for protecting yourself against romance fraud which include:Never send money, vouchers or cryptocurrency to someone you've met onlineTreat people as you would if meeting in person, by asking questions and taking your timeBe cautious about how much information you share, and keep your social media accounts private and secureTalk to friends and familyIf you think you have been a victim of romance fraud, contact your bank immediately and report to Action Fraud.DSupt Kerry Wood, head of economic crime for the Met Police, said \"awareness is the most powerful defence against fraud\"Earlier this month, the Metropolitan Police launched a campaign to help prevent people like Mr Yadav from getting scammed.This included videos giving real-life accounts from victims, showing what romance fraud looked like, how to prevent it, and where to get further support if needed.They have also undertaken intelligence sharing to trace suspects overseas, and collaborated with banks, dating apps and social media sites to identify fraud.Det Supt Kerry Wood, head of economic crime for the Met Police, said romance fraud was \"one of the most devastating\".\"It's an abuse of trust which has a devastating impact on people's confidence and sense of self-worth.\"Awareness is the most powerful defence against fraud. By talking openly, we can protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities from this deeply personal and damaging crime and bring those responsible to justice.\"Mr Yadav was not able to recover the money he lost, but said he had \"made his peace with it\" and has rebuilt his life since.He is now encouraging anyone going through romance fraud to reach out to family, friends and colleagues and most importantly \"do not isolate yourself\".A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "46 minutes agoSean SeddonReutersZelensky is on his third visit to Washington since JanuaryUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday, as Trump weighs whether to arm Ukraine with Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia.Their meeting comes a day after Trump said \"great progress\" was made during a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with the pair agreeing to face-to-face talks in Hungary.Trump said the call, the first with Putin since mid-August, was \"very productive\", adding that teams from Washington and Moscow will meet next week.As Zelensky arrived in the US, his third visit since January, he said Moscow was \"rushing to resume dialogue as soon as it hears about Tomahawks\".Zelensky has called on the US to provide Ukraine with the advanced missiles, which have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles).Asked earlier this week if Trump was considering giving Ukraine Tomahawks, he said: \"We'll see... I may.\" But when asked about the same prospect following his call with Putin, Trump said \"we can't deplete\" the US stockpile of Tomahawks, adding \"we need them too... so I don't know what we can do about that\".Putin-Trump call a curveball for Zelensky ahead of his visitWriting on his Truth Social platform after his call with Putin concluded, Trump said he and the Russian president \"spent a great deal of time talking about Trade between Russia and the United States when the War with Ukraine is over\". He said \"high level advisors\" from both countries would meet at an unspecified location next week, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the American delegation. Trump also said he would update Zelensky on his talks with Putin on Friday, adding: \"I believe great progress was made with today's telephone conversation.\"He later told reporters he expected to meet Putin in Hungary \"within two weeks\".Trump has been seen as more sympathetic toward Russia than his predecessor Joe Biden, but in recent months has taken a stiffer line with Putin. He had hoped a face-to-face summit in Alaska in August would help convince Putin to enter into comprehensive peace talks to end the war - but that meeting failed to produce a decisive breakthrough. They spoke again days later when Trump interrupted a meeting with Zelensky and European leaders to call Putin.Putin spoke with Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.The Russian president briefed Orban on his phone call with Trump, while the Hungarian leader said he would help organise a possible summit in Budapest. Putin also noted plans to discuss further steps to resolve \"the situation in Ukraine\" with US representatives, the state-owned Tass news agency reported.The planned meeting in Budapest was \"great news for the peace-loving people of the world\", Orban wrote on X on Thursday, and he added that he had spoken to Trump by phone.Trump and Putin could have another talk a week after Rubio's meeting with advisors, Orban told state radio. \"Since the EU is pro-war, it is logical that it will be left out of this peace process,\" he added.Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaHours before the Trump-Putin call, Russia launched one of its largest attacks of the year on Ukraine, including 28 ballistic missiles, and 320 drones, according to Ukraine's ambassador to the US, Olga Stefanishyna.Stefanishyna said Russia launching overnight strikes on Ukraine before the call \"exposes Moscow's real attitude toward peace\".In a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS, she added: \"These assaults show that Moscow's strategy is one of terror and exhaustion. The only effective response is pressure - through tougher sanctions, reinforced air defense, and the supply of long-range capabilities.\"Though Trump had indicated that he was considering sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, he told reporters the US could not deplete its stockpile. \"We need them too\", he said after Friday's call with Putin.Ukraine’s navy does not have the necessary ships to operate them, and the US has a small number of launchers needed for the missiles - typically mounted on ships and submarines. The US reinstated its Tomahawk land-based mobile launcher programme, Typhon, in 2023. Its military has at least two Typhon launchers, but it is unlikely to have many more.The possibility of the US sending Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles would cause “extreme concern”, Peskov said on Sunday, adding such a move would be viewed in Russia as \"a major escalation.\"ReutersPutin and Trump last met in person at a US base in Alaska in August 2025During his presidential election campaign, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within days but has since admitted resolving the conflict has been more challenging than any he has been involved in since returning to power. Trump's strained relations with Zelensky came to a head on 28 February when he and Vice-President JD Vance berated the Ukrainian president in the Oval Office on live television. But public relations with Zelensky have vastly improved in recent months. In September, Trump signalled a major shift in his view of the conflict, saying he  believed Kyiv could \"win all of Ukraine back in its original form\", a far cry from his public calls for Kyiv to cede territory occupied by Russia. In late July, Trump set Putin a deadline of less than a fortnight to agree to a ceasefire or face sweeping sanctions, including measures against countries which still trade with Russia.But he did not follow through the threat after Putin agreed to meet Trump in Alaska, which the US president hailed as a significant diplomatic success at the time, despite it not producing any tangible outcome.Earlier on Thursday, India's foreign ministry cast doubt on a claim made by Trump a day earlier saying Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had agreed to stop purchasing Russian oil.An Indian government spokesman said he was \"not aware of any conversation between the two leaders\" taking place the previous day, after Trump said Modi had assured him purchases would stop \"within a short period of time\".The US has pushed for countries - in particular India, China and Nato members - to stop buying Russian energy in an effort to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin. Zelensky has also repeatedly echoed those calls.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

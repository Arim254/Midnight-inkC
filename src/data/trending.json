    "body": "1 hour agoBecky Morton,Political reporter and Jack Fenwick,Political correspondentThe letting agent which rented out Chancellor Rachel Reeves' family home has apologised for an \"oversight\" which led to a failure to obtain the correct licence.Gareth Martin, owner of Harvey & Wheeler, said the company's previous property manager had offered to apply for a \"selective\" rental licence on behalf of their client but this never happened as the individual resigned before the tenancy began.He added: \"We deeply regret the issue caused to our clients as they would have been under the impression that a licence had been applied for.\"Reeves has apologised for the \"inadvertent mistake\" but said she accepts \"full responsibility\".Downing Street has spent the day defending the chancellor, with a spokesman insisting the prime minister has \"full confidence\" in her.Reeves put her four-bedroom South London home up for rent in July 2024, when Labour won the general election and she moved into 11 Downing Street.The house falls in area where Southwark Council requires private landlords to obtain a selective licence at a cost of £945. The chancellor first became aware that her property did not have the correct licence on Wednesday when the Daily Mail, who first reported the story, contacted her.In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Wednesday evening, she said \"we were not aware that a licence was necessary\".\"As soon as it was brought to my attention, we took immediate action and have applied for the licence,\" she wrote.However, in a second letter to the PM on Thursday, Reeves said she had found correspondence confirming that the letting agent had told her husband a licence would be required and that the agency would apply for this on their behalf.\"They have also confirmed today they did not take the application forward, in part due to a member of staff leaving the organisation,\" she wrote.\"Nevertheless, as I said yesterday, I accept it was our responsibility to secure the licence. I also take responsibility for not finding this information yesterday and bringing it to your attention.\"As I said to you today, I am sorry about this matter and accept full responsibility for it.\"Reeves has published the emails, which confirm the letting agent agreed to apply for the licence once the new tenant moved in.In a statement, Mr Martin, the agency's owner, said: \"We alert all our clients to the need for a licence. \"In an effort to be helpful our previous property manager offered to apply for a licence on these clients' behalf, as shown in the correspondence. \"That property manager suddenly resigned on the Friday before the tenancy began on the following Monday.\"Unfortunately, the lack of application was not picked up by us as we do not normally apply for licences on behalf of our clients; the onus is on them to apply. We have apologised to the owners for this oversight.\"At the time the tenancy began, all the relevant certificates were in place and if the licence had been applied for, we have no doubt it would have been granted.\"No 10 will be hoping the latest developments - and the apology from the letting agency used by Reeves and her husband - will bring this saga to an end.But it is yet another day when the government completely lost control of the news agenda.Ministers wanted to spend the day discussing their efforts to take dangerous knives off the streets, but that announcement barely registered.Downing Street will still be worried this evening about how this all looks to voters.The Conservatives have said the prime minister needs to \"grow a backbone and start a proper investigation\".A party spokesman said: \"Last night Rachel Reeves said 'she had not been made aware of the licensing requirement'. \"Today, we find out that Reeves was alerted to the need for a licence in writing by the estate agents.\"Having been caught out, the chancellor is now trying to make the estate agents take the blame, but Reeves never followed up with them to ensure that the licence had been applied for, or checked if the licence had been granted.\"Regardless, under the law, Reeves and her husband are responsible for ensuring the licence is granted.\"",

The BBC has approached Paris Match for a response.Prince William and Catherine are known to want to create as private a family life as possible for their three children, and to protect them from media intrusion.\"Their Royal Highnesses The Prince and Princess of Wales, have been successful in legal proceedings brought in France against the owner of Paris Match, which published a grossly intrusive article and long-lens paparazzi photographs of their private family holiday in the Alps in April,\" the Kensington Palace spokesperson said on Thursday.\"The ruling affirms that, notwithstanding their public duties as members of The Royal Family, Their Royal Highnesses and their children are entitled to respect for their private lives and family time, without unlawful interference and intrusion.\"The Prince and Princess of Wales are committed to protecting their private family time and ensuring that their children can grow up without undue scrutiny and interference.\"They will not hesitate to take such action as is necessary to enforce those boundaries.\"It is understood that the summary proceedings were issued on 28 April, just shy of two weeks after the article was published, with an oral hearing held in June.Further developments are understood to have taken place in September, with an interim order issued by the president of the first chamber of the Nanterre Court which was sealed into a final order on 14 October.The court is understood to have ruled that the magazine had infringed the privacy and image rights of Prince William, Catherine and their children, with Paris Match ordered to pay the couple's legal costs in France and print a judicial notice acknowledging the breach.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentThe UK's winter flu season has begun five weeks earlier than usual, health officials are warning.The UK Health Security Agency said cases were rising quickly among children and young people – and warned the virus would soon start to spread across older age groups.The organisation urged people eligible for the flu vaccine to come forward to get protected.But they said it was too early to say how difficult and serious this year's flu season would be.Two of the worst winter flu seasons of the past decade have been seen in the last three years, something partly attributed to the bounce-back of the virus after Covid restrictions and when immunity has been low.Last year nearly 8,000 people died from flu and in the 2022-23 flu season there were nearly 16,000 deaths.UKHSA flu lead Dr Suzanna McDonald said: \"We are worried that flu has started to circulate a little bit earlier than usual.\"It's a very serious disease. It's not just a nasty cold. \"We have started to see early activity, particularly in young adults, mainly sort of university age students, and also with school-aged children. \"We would expect in the coming weeks that this will start to spread throughout the community and this is something that we will monitor very closely.\"Dr Alex Allen, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, urged all eligible people to come forward for vaccination.Everyone aged 65 and over, pregnant women and those with certain long-term health conditions can get a free flu jab on the NHS.\"If you're eligible for a vaccine it is because you are at greater risk of severe illness – every year we see many thousands end up in hospital and far too many deaths from flu. \"It's crucial that everyone eligible books their appointment as soon as possible. The vaccine is our best defence.\"He also reminded parents of under 16-year-olds to return consent forms to school so their children can get vaccinated, or if they are aged two and three to arrange a vaccine via their GP.\"The nasal spray vaccine can help stop your child from getting very unwell and reduce the risk of passing flu to vulnerable family members.\"Anyone with flu or Covid symptoms – including high temperature, cough, and feeling tired or achy – should minimise contact with others, especially those who are vulnerable. \"If you need to go out with symptoms, consider wearing a face covering, wash hands regularly and ensure indoor spaces are well ventilated,\" he added. Meanwhile, UKHSA said Covid cases were decreasing and the virus was now at baseline levels.",

    "body": "14 hours agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and west reporterGetty ImagesAt least 32 people in Dumbarton were accused of witchcraftToday it sits as a nondescript car park behind a large council office.Yet hundreds of years ago an unassuming patch of land in Dumbarton was the location for some of Scotland's darkest moments - as locals who had been accused of witchcraft were led there to be executed. More than two dozen people in the town were accused and tortured in the belief that they were doing Satan's bidding, as religious fervour swept the area during the 17th Century.Now campaigners are hoping to spotlight the names of those accused and pay tribute to them with a memorial.In 2022 Nicola Sturgeon offered a formal apology to people accused of witchcraft between the 16th and 18th Centuries.About 4,000 Scots, mostly women, were accused of breaking the Witchcraft Act between 1563 and 1736, and the vast majority were executed.Louise Wilson has been researching the history of witches in Dumbarton, where she believes suspicion of witchcraft was common. Through historical records she has already found 32 cases of people accused from 1624 to 1697 - with 22 of those executed.Of the remaining 10, one fled the region while the fates of the other nine have been lost to history.\"Port towns had a lot of accused in Scotland,\" explains Louise, the secretary of Remembering The Accused Witches of Scotland.\"A lot of hustle and bustle leads to more accusations, so as well as Dumbarton it was the same on the coast of Fife and in Ayr. The failing of the crops, or bad trade or a ship having trouble – these would all be blamed on witches.\"RAWSRemembering The Accused Witches of Scotland would like a memorial placed in DumbartonWitch hunts took place in many countries during that period, but academics have previously said Scotland's execution rate was five times the European average.For Louise, the most terrifying aspect of the accusations lies in how easily they could be made, often with little evidence.   \"These were ordinary people doing ordinary jobs, but if you argue with your neighbour you could end up accused of witchcraft,\" says Louise.\"There is a woman called Jonet Boyd, in 1628.  A man called Robert Glen, who was a notary, accused her. \"He had met her on the street and said she threw words and obscenities at him, grabbed his clock, whipped him around and threw a stone at him. Two witnesses also confirmed this happened. \"The next morning he accused her of witchcraft – however there is nothing in the records about whether he had done something to her to make her act like that.  Maybe she turned him down – we don't know.\"Jonet Boyd was executed as a result of the accusations from Robert Glen.Not all the accused were women, though the majority were. Louise recounts a slater called John McWilliam, who fled to Stranraer after being accused of witchcraft for a second time, before going on trial in Edinburgh. He was then executed in 1655.Louise WilsonLouise Wilson believes it is important to remember those falsely accused Other signs of witchcraft listed in local records include not attending church and talking to animals, which were assumed to be a witch's familiar - meaning a supernatural creature helping the accused.If someone was accused, they would be subject to brutal torture aimed at securing a confession. However methods often associated with witch trials, such throwing them into water with hands tied behind their back, were more common in England rather than Scotland.Scottish alternatives were not any more pleasant, however.\"Things like dooking or hanging weren't done in Scotland – they were strangled and burned instead,\" says Louise.\"They would be kept awake for three days and three nights, getting beaten told to keep walking while have accusations screamed at them. They also used thumb and finger screws, iron boots and crimp claws.\"They would be stripped naked and their hair shaved, then brought in front of a judiciary of ministers and highly ranked men in the town.\"Someone would search for the devil's mark to prove they were in league with Satan - that could be something like a mole or a birthmark.  So by the time they were executed they looked the typical stereotype of a Halloween witch.\"GoogleThe site for witches' executions is now a car park for the council.Those stereotypes might bring to mind images of black hats, broomsticks and cackling over cauldrons, common in much media.However for the accused, the effect of the accusations - even if later cleared - were immense. In Dumbarton the situation was stoked by zealous local ministers, with the Covenanter movement having considerable influence at the time.\"You had ministers saying witches were among us, they are in thrall to Satan and it was being drummed in people that witches were among the community. \"This lasted for over 150 years but it's not well known about, it's not being taught in history classes.\"Louise and the rest of the RAWS team are now seeking to place a memorial at the execution site off Church Street in Dumbarton.They will also host a conference at Maryhill Burgh Halls on 8 November. Earlier councillors discussed the matter, and agreed that it was important to remember the victims.A West Dunbartonshire Council spokesperson said: \"We have been engaging with Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland who are keen to install a fitting memorial.\"For Louise, a display would be important, as would telling the stories of those accused to future generations.\"When you say their names and tell their stories, it's a way of remembering them.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoCharlotte EdwardsBusiness reporterVirgin Trains has moved closer to being able to run rail services through the Channel Tunnel after the regulator approved its application to share a depot with Eurostar.The decision by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) means Eurostar's monopoly on passenger services is set to be broken for the first time since the tunnel opened in 1994.Temple Mills railway storehouse in east London is the only depot in the UK able to accommodate the larger trains used in continental Europe and which is already linked to the cross-Channel line.Virgin aims to start running services from 2030. Eurostar said it was reviewing the decision and \"considering our next steps to ensure we can continue to grow\".\"Our priority is to deliver for passengers the benefits of the investments in a new fleet, jobs, and depot facilities that we recently announced,\" a Eurostar spokesperson said.Previously, the ORR had said the Temple Mills depot had enough space to either house an expanded Eurostar fleet or accommodate a rival company's trains – but not both.The regulator said a number of steps needed to be taken before new international services could run. Virgin needs to enter into a commercial agreement with Eurostar, will have to secure finance, access to track and stations, and have to get safety approvals from UK and EU authorities.But the ORR said its decision unlocked plans for around £700m of investment and could create 400 new jobs, describing it as \"a win for passengers, customer choice, and economic growth\".Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, said: \"The ORR's decision is the right one for consumers – it's time to end this 30-year monopoly and bring some Virgin magic to the cross-Channel route.\"Rail Minister Lord Hendy said he was \"incredibly pleased\" with the ORR's decision and called it a \"significant step forward\".\"Allowing Virgin Trains to share this vital facility will give passengers greater choice, better value and improve connectivity for millions, as well as drive innovation, lower fares and promote greener connections with Europe,\" he said.Martin Jones, deputy director of Access and International at the ORR, said: \"While there is still some way to go before the first new services can run, we stand ready to work with Virgin Trains as their plans develop.\"Several firms had wanted to start operating services between London and mainland Europe, including Spanish start-up Evolyn, Richard Branson's Virgin and a partnership between Gemini Trains and Uber.The ORR only approved Virgin's application on Thursday and rejected applications from Evolyn, Gemini and Trenitalia.Virgin said it planned to launch rail services from London St Pancras to Europe from 2030.This will include services to Paris Gare du Nord, Brussels-Midi and Amsterdam Centraal, with future plans to expand further across France, and into Germany and Switzerland.The plans would mean Virgin Trains returning to the rails for the first time since 2019, when the company lost its contract to Avanti West Coast.Virgin Trains had operated a service running from London Euston via Birmingham and Manchester to Scotland for 22 years before it was disqualified from bidding for the franchise.",

Then, the last preliminary results came in from the capital Amsterdam and Rob Jetten's liberals moved significantly ahead by more than 15,000 votes.Both parties were below 17% of the national vote, and three other parties were not far behind, including the conservative-liberal VVD on 22 seats, followed by the left-wing GreenLeft-Labour party and the Christian Democrats.Wilders led the polls throughout the election campaign, but after he pulled the plug on his own coalition in June in a row over asylum and migration, all the mainstream leaders made clear they did not wish to work with him again.He admits he has little hope of forming a government himself, but said on X on Thursday that if his party did top the vote he should have the first try. Even without a clear-cut victory, Jetten - who staged a remarkable campaign - would stand a stronger chance of leading the next administration.Only a few weeks ago, the polls put D66 - a party formed by democratic reformers in 1966 - on just 12 seats.But the photogenic, 38-year-old liberal leader capitalised on polished performances in a succession of TV debates and interviews. The fact that he also competed in a TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the weeks leading to the vote only added to his public profile.EPARob Jetten, 38, led a highly polished campaign and outperformed his rivals in TV debatesJetten was careful not to claim victory on Wednesday night, despite the party mood among his supporters.The conservative liberal VVD of Dilan Yesilgöz was also heading for a successful night in third place and her party would be a good fit for any potential Jetten-led coalition.Going into Wednesday's election, voters knew the result would be on a knife-edge, as five parties were in the running to win. Wilders' PVV Freedom Party won 37 seats in November 2023, but many of those voters will have been put off by the realisation he would struggle to find parties to work with him again.It took seven months for Wilders to reach a deal with coalition partners in 2024, only to bring down the government 11 months later. Rob Jetten made clear he was looking for a broad-based coalition that was both \"stable and ambitious\", and he pointed out it was unprecedented for the winning party to score fewer than 30 seats in parliament.He named the Labour-GreenLeft party of former European Commissioner Frans Timmermans as one potential coalition partner, along with Yesilgöz's conservative-liberal VVD and the revitalised Christian Democrats.That may not be easy as Yesilgöz has vowed not to work with the left. Another option is JA21, a populist right-wing party with 9 MPs, but that would leave him just short of the 76-seat majority he needs.SEM VAN DER WAL/ANP/AFPDilan Yesilgöz (R) also had a good election after good performances in TV debatesThe exit poll spelt bad news for Frans Timmermans, whose left-wing party had long been second in the polls and is now set to come fourth. \"Better times lie ahead,\" he promised his supporters late on Wednesday. \"Of course I'm hugely disappointed,\" he added, and announced he was stepping down and taking responsibility for the result.Timmermans and Wilders are both in their early 60s and entered politics at the same time, and there is now a sense that Dutch voters are prepared to try something new.Wilders, however, said he was going nowhere: \"You won't be rid of me until I'm 80.\" He remained bullish about his Freedom Party's performance: \"I would naturally rather have seen more seats... but we have still had our second best result.\"Matthijs Rooduijn of the University of Amsterdam said Wilders' party had lost the support of many of its moderate voters to other parties as well as many on the more radical side.But, he said, \"the losses could have been worse\", given that Wilders had himself broken up the last coalition and had campaigned less actively than his rivals.Anna Holligan/BBCSupporters of Jetten's centrist liberals were overjoyed with the surprise resultThere was palpable excitement as D66 supporters gathered for the results at a music venue in Leiden, a university city between Amsterdam and The Hague. As the exit polls became clear, the words \"yes, we can\" were voiced repeatedly as a kind of party mantra in the hall.Taking to the stage, the man now tipped to be the youngest prime minister in modern Dutch history told supporters \"we did it - the best result D66 has ever achieved\".\"We also know that millions of Dutch people voted for other parties, and I also feel a very heavy responsibility for [all of them],\" said Rob Jetten. \"We will do all we can in the coming years to show all the Dutch people that politics and government can be there for them again so they can think big again and act big again so the Netherlands can move forward.\"This election was partly fought on migration and overcrowded asylum centres, but the biggest issue for voters was the chronic housing shortage of almost 400,000 homes, in a population of 18 million.Jetten's party has said it will build 10 cities as part of its plan to tackle the crisis.\"It was a campaign of optimism, it shows the Dutch are tired of two years of standstill, we recognise big challenges and we want progress on those,\" said D66 supporter Eline. \"It shows the Dutch are craving a prime minister who is able to unite the country and tackle the major challenges our country and the world are facing.\"Another potential coalition partner for the liberals is the Christian Democrats, who only two years ago looked down and out with just a handful of seats. Now they are projected to win 18. \"What a fantastic result - two years ago we could not have dared to dream of this,\" CDA leader Henri Bontenbal told supporters as they chanted his name.",

    "body": "Trump caps refugee admissions at record low - with most to be white South Africans1 hour agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesTrump criticised South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in May and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\"The Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.The move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.No reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was \"justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest\".In January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety. The previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.The notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would \"primarily\" be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and \"other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands\".In February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community - who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers - to settle in the US as refugees.South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of \"mobilising a supremacism\" and trying to \"project white victimhood as a dog whistle\".In the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and \"persecuted\".The White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years. The tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.The South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.Watch: 'Turn the lights down' - how the Trump-Ramaphosa meeting took an unexpected turnOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the US's lack of \"ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\" and \"protects their safety and security\".The US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups. Do Afrikaners want to take Trump up on his South African refugee offer?'I didn't come here for fun' - Afrikaner defends refugee status in USIs there a genocide of white South Africans as Trump claims?Some have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East. \"This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling,\" Global Refuge CEO and president Krish O'Mara Vignarajah said on Thursday. \"It lowers our moral standing.\" \"At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programme's purpose as well as its credibility,\" she added. The South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement. During the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is \"doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trump's] head\".Earlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances. While the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. ",

    "body": "3 hours agoVanessa Buschschlüter and Rute Pina,BBC Brasil, reporting from São PauloBruno ItanDozens of bodies were laid out in a square in Penha, in northern Rio, after the deadliest police raid in the city's historyA photographer who witnessed the aftermath of a massive Brazilian police operation in Rio de Janeiro has told the BBC of how residents came back with mutilated bodies of those who had died.The bodies \"kept coming: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45...\", Bruno Itan told BBC Brasil. They included those of police officers.One of the bodies had been decapitated - others were \"totally disfigured\", he said. Many also had what he says were stab wounds. More than 120 people were killed during Tuesday's raid on a criminal gang - the deadliest such raid in the city.EPA/ShutterstockMore than 100 people were arrested as part of the operationBruno Itan told BBC Brasil that he was first alerted to the raid early on Tuesday by residents of the Alemão neighbourhood, who sent him messages telling him there was a shoot-out. The photographer made his way to the Getúlio Vargas hospital, where the bodies were arriving.Itan says that the police stopped members of the press from entering the Penha neighbourhood, where the operation was under way. \"Police officers formed a line and said: 'The press doesn't get past here.'\"But Itan, who grew up in the area, says he was able to make his way into the cordoned-off area, where he remained until the next morning. He says that Tuesday night, local residents began to search the hillside which divides Penha from the nearby Alemão neighbourhood for relatives who had been missing since the police raid.Bruno ItanResidents of the Penha neighbourhood proceeded to place the recovered bodies in a  square - and Itan's photos show the reaction of the people there. \"The brutality of it all impacted me a lot: the sorrow of the families, mothers fainting, pregnant wives, crying, outraged parents,\" the photographer recalled.Bruno ItanThere was shock in Penha as locals retrieved more and more bodies from the nearby  hillsideThe governor of Rio state said that the massive police operation involving around 2,500 security personnel was aimed at stopping a criminal group known as Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from expanding its territory.Initially, the Rio state government maintained that \"60 suspects and four police officers\" had been killed in the operation.They have since said that their \"preliminary\" count shows that 117 \"suspects\" have been killed.Rio's public defender's office, which provides legal assistance to the poor, has put the total number of people killed at 132.According to researchers, Red Command is the only criminal group which in recent years has managed to make territorial gains in the state of Rio de Janeiro.It is widely considered one of the two largest gangs in the country, alongside First Capital Command (PCC), and has a history dating back more than 50 years. According to Brazilian journalist Rafael Soares, who has been covering crime in Rio for years, Red Command \"operates like a franchise\" with local criminal leaders forming part of the gang and becoming \"business partners\".The gang engages primarily in drug trafficking, but also smuggles guns, gold, fuel, alcohol and tobacco.According to the authorities, gang members are well armed and police said that during the raid, they came under attack from explosive-laden drones. The governor of Rio state, Cláudio Castro, described Red Command members as \"narcoterrorists\" and called the four police officers killed in the raid \"heroes\".But the number of people killed in the operation has come in for criticism with the  Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights saying it was \"horrified\".At a news conference on Wednesday, Governor Castro defended the police force.\"It wasn't our intention to kill anyone. We wanted to arrest them all alive,\" he said.He added that the situation had escalated because the suspects had retaliated: \"It was a consequence of the retaliation they carried out and the disproportionate use of force by those criminals.\"The governor also said that the bodies displayed by locals in Penha had been \"manipulated\". In a post on X, he said that some of them had been stripped of the camouflage clothing he said they had been wearing \"in order to shift blame onto the police\".Felipe Curi of Rio's civil police force also said that \"camouflage clothing, vests, and weapons\" had been removed from the bodies and showed footage appearing to show a man cutting camouflage clothing off a corpse. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has summoned Governor Castro to a hearing on Monday to explain the police actions \"in detail\".With additional reporting by BBC Brasil's Carol Castro in Rio de Janeiro.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, travelling with the presidentGetty ImagesThe main event of Trump's trip came in its final hours as he met with President XiUS presidential trips abroad have traditionally been an opportunity to display the power of the American nation on the world stage. Donald Trump's five-day swing through eastern Asia, on the other hand, has been a display of the power of Trump - but also, at times, of that power's limitations.Trump's stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea over the course of the first four days were an exercise in pleasing a sometimes mercurial American president. It was an acknowledgement that Trump, with the flick of a pen, could impose tariffs and other measures that have the potential to devastate the economies of export-dependent nations.His sit-down with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, was something entirely different. It was a meeting of equals on the global stage, where the stakes for both nations – for their economies, for their international prestige, for the welfare of their people - were enormous.With China, Trump may flick his pen, but such actions come with consequences. They come with a cost.Trump hails 'amazing' meeting with Xi but no trade deal agreedXi and Trump find temporary truce as China plays longer gameFor the first four days, Trump's most recent foray into global diplomacy was smooth sailing. Each stop was punctuated by a blend of traditional trade negotiations – deals made under the shadow of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs – and personal accommodations that at times bordered on the obsequious.In Malaysia, Trump secured access to critical minerals and made progress toward finalising trade arrangements with south-east Asian nations. He also presided over a treaty that should ease border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia – the kind of \"peace deal\" the American president loves to tout.ReutersTrump received a warm welcome - complete with gifts - from Japan's prime ministerIn Japan, Trump's Marine One flew past a Tokyo Tower lit red, white and blue – with a top in Trumpian gold.Newly elected Prime Minister Sanai Takaichi detailed $550bn in Japanese investments in the US and offered the American president a gift of 250 cherry trees for America's 250th birthday, and a golf club and bag that belonged to Shinzo Abe, the assassinated former prime minister who bonded with Trump in his first term. She also became the latest foreign leader to nominate Trump for his much-desired Nobel Peace Prize.Not to be outdone, South Korea welcomed Trump with artillery firing a 21-gun salute and a military band that played Hail to the Chief and YMCA – the Village People song that has become a Trump rally anthem.President Lee Jae Myung held an \"honour ceremony\" for Trump during which he gave the American leader his nation's highest medal and a replica of an ancient Korean dynastic crown.Lunch with Lee featured a \"Peacemaker's Dessert\" of gold-encrusted brownies. Later that day, the Koreans served Trump vineyard wine at an intimate dinner in Trump's honour with six world leaders attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference summit.Getty ImagesIn the US, Trump may be the subject of \"No Kings\" demonstrations by Americans who disapprove of his boundary-testing expansions of presidential power, but during his East Asia swing he was treated like royalty.And like the kings of old, Trump arrived in Korea seeking tribute – in the form of $200bn in cash payments, $20bn a year, from South Korea to the US, to be invested at the direction of Trump's government. Agreement on the terms of those payments helped ensure that the tariff rate on South Korean exports to the US would drop from 25% to 15%.The main event of Trump's Asia trip came in its final hours, however, as he met with Xi. There, the power dynamic between leaders of the world's two largest economies was decidedly different than the interactions Trump had with his foreign counterparts in previous days.Missing were all the pomp and the pageantry. No military bands, no honour guards, no carefully crafted menus celebrating mutual national affection. Instead, the two leaders and their top aides sat across a long white negotiating table in a nondescript military building just off the runway of Busan's international airport.Watch: Handshakes and whispers: Trump and Xi’s meeting…in 73 secondsIt was perhaps a reflection of the high stakes that when Trump shook hands with Xi in Busan, he appeared tense. It was a far cry from his relaxed attitude when he told me the day before that he was optimistic he would have a good meeting.\"I know a little bit about what's going on because we have been talking to them,\" he said. \"I'm not just walking into a meeting cold.\"For months, Trump had been threatening higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the US – as a source of revenue for the American treasury as well as to pressure China to open its markets and control the export of chemicals used to make the drug fentanyl.China, unlike many of America's other trading partners, responded with escalation, not concessions.If tariffs were a source of economic hardship for China, then Beijing would target America's vulnerabilities. It suspended purchase of US agricultural products and proposed export controls on its large supply of critical minerals - resources that the US, and much of the world, rely on for high-tech manufacturing.Trump's mood was upbeat after the meeting, which he described as \"amazing\" and graded a 12 on a scale of 1-10. The president appeared in a good mood even as the plane jostled from rough turbulence as it climbed into the sky.But it was a battle of wills and economic pain set the two nations on a path that ultimately led to Thursday's meeting and an agreement on both sides to de-escalate. The US lowered its tariffs, while China eased access to critical minerals, and pledged to resume importing US agricultural products and increase purchases of US oil and gas.While it may not have been a breakthrough, it was an acknowledgement by both sides that the existing situation was unsustainable.ReutersThe US president was positive about his meeting with his Chinese counterpart on ThursdayThe international order that will take its place, however, is far from clear. As Xi acknowledged in his opening remarks at the bilateral meeting, China and the US \"do not always see eye to eye with each other\".\"It is normal for the two leading economies in the world to have frictions now and then,\" he said.That may represent an improved outlook after months of tension, but it was also an sign that \"frictions\" are here to stay.China has global and regional ambitions and a growing willingness to expand its influence.Trump, for his part, has attempted to reorder American priorities abroad, using US economic might to pressure allies and adversaries alike. And it is those American allies – nations like Japan and South Korea that have long relied on American political, economic and military support -  that are scrambling to adjust to the new reality.Some of that scrambling comes in the form of  a bend-backward willingness to accommodate Trump in forms large and small. Gifts and dinnertime honours are easy, but multibillion dollar payments, increased military spending and permanent tariffs take a toll. And they could ultimately prompt a reevaluation of relations with America – and, as a result, with China.Trump may have received a king's welcome in South Korea, but, in what could be viewed as a bit of on-point symbolism, as he departed, it was Xi who was arriving. And the Chinese leader's Korean hosts had promised a diplomatic reception equal to that received by the Americans.Xi is fully participating in the Apec leaders meetings – proceedings that Trump chose to skip. If there is a vacuum created by America's international manoeuvres, it is a void China appears more than willing to fill.Trump may be returning to America with everything he wanted from this trip. But, in a twist on the Rolling Stones song that he used to play at his political rallies, it's not yet clear that he got what America needs.",

    "body": "England's most deprived areas named - see how your area is affected3 hours agoChristine Jeavans and Phil Leake,data journalists, BBC VerifyGetty ImagesJaywick, near Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, has been named the most deprived neighbourhood in England for the fourth consecutive time since 2010, new data shows.Seven areas in Blackpool are also among the 10 most deprived, alongside one in Hastings and one in Rotherham, according to the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).Half of the neighbourhoods in Middlesbrough are very deprived, making it the council with the highest proportion, ahead of Birmingham and Hartlepool.The minister for local government and homelessness, Alison McGovern, said the figures were an indictment of previous policies and the government was \"tackling the root causes of deprivation head on\".The Index of Multiple Deprivation looks at living conditions across an area - but does not mean that everyone in a highly deprived neighbourhood will be struggling, nor will all those in a less deprived area be well off.The figures published on Thursday do not show whether an area has become better or worse off since the previous report, but instead show patterns of how areas have changed relative to each other.Deprivation is spread across the country, with 65% of local authorities containing at least one highly deprived neighbourhood, up from 61% in 2019.A neighbourhood to the east of Jaywick was again found to be the most deprived having previously topped the list in the last three reports, released in 2010, 2015 and 2019.Clacton MP Nigel Farage, whose parliamentary constituency includes Jaywick, told the PA news agency he was \"obviously sad that things aren't improving more quickly\".He said he believed he had \"definitely helped\" tourism in the area, with \"having a high-profile MP helping to put Clacton on the map\". But he added: \"I'm doing what I can, but there's a limit to what one person can do.\"The MHCLG found 82% of areas found to be the most deprived in 2025 were already in that category in 2019.The department used a number of weighted metrics to determine a neighbourhood's level of deprivation, including income, crime and barriers to housing.They are then assessed as more or less deprived compared to other neighbourhoods.Middlesbrough has the highest percentage of very deprived neighbourhoods for income, education and crime, while Hartlepool tops the list for employment.Liverpool has dropped out of the top 10 overall despite ranking second in 2019, but it still fares worst for health with more than 60% of its neighbourhoods classed as highly deprived.The report also found that Tower Hamlets and Hackney in London had the highest levels of income deprivation among households with children.Meanwhile, nine of the 10 local authority districts with the highest levels of income deprivation among older people are in London.There are pockets of deprivation surrounded by less deprived areas in every region of England, but highly deprived places are most concentrated in the north and the midlands.More than one in five neighbourhoods in the North East and the North West are in the most deprived category, compared with around one in 25 in London, the South West and the East of England, and one in 33 in the South East.England's least deprived neighbourhood is in the town of Harpenden, near St Albans in Hertfordshire.The report is the latest in a long-running series that are used by central and local government and other bodies to target resources for local services.The government's recently announced Pride in Place funding - offering \"overlooked\" communities a share of £5bn - was allocated in part based on the deprivation figures from 2019.Areas with a history of heavy industry or mining are particularly affected, the report's authors highlight, along with parts of East London and several coastal towns including Jaywick.The former holiday resort was visited by the UN special rapporteur for extreme poverty as part of a fact-finding mission in 2018.And last year, its local district council, Tendring, agreed a £126m 20-year improvement plan.The latest data highlights \"the scale of the challenge\" but does not \"reflect the progress made since 2019 or the strength of the people who call Jaywick Sands home\", Tendring District Council said in a statement.Council leader Mark Stephenson described Jaywick as a \"truly special place\" and called on the government for extra funding.Speaking to the BBC, local resident Christopher Thompson, 60, said: \"[Jaywick] is deprived, it needs investment, there is nothing here for the kids.\"The community is amazing - amazing people down here, they all help each other out.\"Henry Godfrey Evans / BBCJaywick resident Christopher Thompson admitted the area was deprived and said there was nothing for children to doGovernment minister McGovern said the statistics were a \"damning indictment of a system that has left some communities broken, councils pushed to a financial cliff edge and residents facing the brunt of service cuts\".Previous policies had \"barely begun to break the cycle of deprivation,\" leading to stagnant local growth and \"loss of hope\", she said.McGovern added the government was \"tackling the root causes of deprivation head on\" by investing £500m in children's development, extending free school meals and a new £1bn crisis support package across the UK.The previous Conservative government also used deprivation figures, along with other criteria, when deciding where would receive \"Levelling Up\" grants.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have Indices of Multiple Deprivation which are each published separately. No dates have yet been announced for these updates.How is deprivation measured?The Index of Multiple Deprivation ranks all of England's 33,755 neighbourhoods, each with an average of 1,500 people, by their deprivation score.The score is calculated from data on income, employment, education, crime, health and disability, barriers to housing and services, and the living environment.Once all the neighbourhoods are ranked, they are split into 10 equal groups called deciles, where the first decile is the 3,375 most deprived neighbourhoods and so on. We are using terms like \"highly deprived\" and \"most deprived\" to refer to this group of neighbourhoods. There are areas of deprivation throughout England and not everyone in a neighbourhood will experience deprivation equally.Additional reporting by Jess Carr, Libby Rogers and Lucy DadyMore on this story",

    "body": "Media caption, Click above to watch this week's episode of The Whole 10 YardsByBen CollinsBBC Sport journalistNFL 2025 season: Week nineBBC coverage: Live text commentary of Sunday's games on the BBC Sport website and app (from 17:30 BST). Also live radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds of Kansas City Chiefs v Buffalo Bills (from 20:00 BST).England men's football captain Harry Kane has made no secret of his desire to one day play in the NFL.As recently as last month the Bayern Munich striker, 32, said that trying to become an American football kicker was \"always something that's in the back of my mind\".\"I know it will be a lot of hard work,\" he said in 2023. \"I'm not expecting to just rock up and start kicking field goals. It would be a lot of practice.\"One Super Bowl winner is willing to help him with that as he is not only backing Kane to make the transition, but offering to train him.How Brady sparked Kane's NFL obsessionAs Kane prepared to win his 100th cap for England last September, football writer Henry Winter spoke to BBC Radio 5 Live about what the future may hold for England's all-time leading goalscorer.\"If I was taking a punt, as it were, I would say that within three years he'll be a kicker in the NFL,\" said Winter. \"He's talked about it, he's big mates with Tom Brady, and it has been done before.\"As a young footballer, Kane was inspired by a 2011 documentary he watched about legendary quarterback Brady and then became a New England Patriots fan.He attended the Patriots' 2019 Super Bowl win in Atlanta and became friends with Brady and team-mate Julian Edelman, who are both now retired.During a 2023 appearance on Good Morning America, external - the most-watched morning show in the US - Kane said that becoming an NFL kicker is \"something I want to definitely explore\" when he retires from football.\"The NFL is something I've been following for about 10 years now,\" he said. \"I love it, so I would love to give it a go.\"Why ex-punter Colquitt can help KaneDustin Colquitt emulated his father Craig by not just becoming an NFL punter but a Super Bowl champion, with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020.Colquitt spent 15 seasons with the Chiefs, setting the franchise record for most games (238), but he grew up dreaming of playing in the Premier League.He played football at high school, earning college scholarship offers, and remains a big football fan.He remembers cheering on Kane during World Cup games and, asked if the ex-Tottenham striker could become an NFL kicker, Colquitt told BBC Sport: \"Absolutely, if he focused on it. He would do fantastic. I've seen some of his finishing skills.\"I would love to actually work with him just because I love soccer, and his excitement. He's seeking this out - that's part of the fibre of his being, that he wants to try this NFL thing.\"Almost always, a team's punter holds the ball in place for kickers. As Colquitt puts it, a punter \"holds the kicker's job literally in his hands\" and \"if you have a bad hold, really bad things happen\".So if and when Kane begins to practise kicking, he needs an experienced holder, otherwise his bid to become a two-sport athlete could be over before it has truly begun.\"The guy that holds for those field goals, that is extremely important - knowing where the laces [on the ball] are, if you've got wind,\" Colquitt said.\"So when he's ready, I'm ready.\"Media caption, Harry Kane is a big NFL fan and has expressed interest in becoming a kickerWhy Kane thinks he has an advantageColquitt said punters and kickers tend to approach each kick with a mentality of \"one shot, one kill - you've got one shot and you better kill it\".\"You only need them when you need them, but they've got to be money when they're counted on,\" he added.Whereas punters punt the ball out of their hands downfield, kickers must kick a stationary ball between the posts - for a field goal or an extra point after a touchdown (PAT).Kane told The Overlap with Gary Neville, external in 2021 that the kicks an NFL kicker makes are \"almost the equivalent to a penalty kick\".Not including shootouts, Kane has scored 93 out of 105 penalties during his senior career, and missed only one of 37 since his World Cup miss against France in December 2022.\"A lot of people can score penalties in training or kick it a long way, but can you do it under pressure when the moment's big, when the game's on the line?\" Kane told Neville.\"That aspect is the bit where maybe I have a bit of an advantage over some younger people coming through.\"Which footballers have made NFL switch?When Winter said \"it has been done before\", he referenced former Austria footballer Toni Fritsch.After Pete Gogolak introduced football-style kicking to the NFL in the 1960s, the Dallas Cowboys toured Europe scouting similar kickers and discovered Fritsch, who quit football aged 26 to pursue an NFL career.The Cowboys won the 1972 Super Bowl at the end of his first season and, although Fritsch was injured, he received a Super Bowl ring.Garo Yepremian, Morten Andersen, Jan Stenerud, Toni Linhart and Neil O'Donoghue also became NFL kickers after playing football in Europe, while Clive Allen was 35 when he tried his luck with the London Monarchs in 1997.The former Tottenham and England striker made six out of six field goals and seven out of 10 PATs - but none of his field goals were from further than 40 yards and his American football adventure ended there.Current NFL kickers Brandon Aubrey (Dallas Cowboys), Harrison Butker (Kansas City Chiefs) and Cairo Santos (Chicago Bears) have all played football, and the fact Nick Folk and Matt Prater are still making field goals at 41 offers Kane hope.His Bayern contract runs until 2027, just before his 34th birthday, so, although he is open to signing an extension, there is still time for Kane's NFL dream to come true.",

    "body": "Do Liverpool fans think Slot is under pressure?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arne Slot was added to the banner above - created by the Irish Kop website - before the 2025-26 seasonByEmily SalleyBBC Sport journalist and Ellie ThomasonBBC Sport Senior JournalistArne Slot has already cemented his place in Liverpool history.The 47-year-old Reds manager is one of the iconic faces on a banner displayed on the Kop before every home game, alongside Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish, Rafael Benitez and Jurgen Klopp - all the Liverpool managers to have won a top-flight title or European Cup.After winning the Premier League in his first season, and spending almost £450m on a new-look squad in the summer, it seemed as though Slot was going to carry on in the same fashion this season.They started their title defence with five straight wins - albeit leaving it late at times - but have now gone over a month without a Premier League victory.They sit seventh in the table, seven points behind leaders Arsenal, and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, losing 3-0 at home to Crystal Palace.After six defeats in their past seven games, BBC Sport spoke to Liverpool fans to find out what's going on this season and how they feel towards the manager.'We are losing patience'Slot's squad selection for Wednesday's EFL Cup defeat by Crystal Palace sparked huge debate.He made 10 changes from Liverpool's last outing, handing out two debuts and naming three teenagers in his starting line-up, plus a further five among his substitutes.The likes of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, Dominik Szoboszlai, Cody Gakpo, Florian Wirtz, Mohamed Salah and Hugo Ekitike were all absent as the Reds made a tame exit in a competition they have won twice in the past four seasons.Liverpool fan Abigail Rudkin told BBC Sport she is disappointed by Slot's decision-making.\"Walking to the game last night, me and my dad got the team sheet and we were like 'he's sacrificed this',\" she said. \"I understand we are losing games at the moment but you need to try and get a winning mentality back.\"We are losing patience. I think there are two different sides of the fanbase at the minute. \"There are those on social media that are calling on him to lose his job, and there are the people I see at the ground, like me, who are losing patience going to these games and not enjoying it as much with losing the games, but they also want to stay patient with him because we are very grateful to him for what we've had from last season when we thought it would all fall apart without Jurgen Klopp.\"Jordan Chamberlain from Empire of the Kop said he will forgive Slot's team selection on Wednesday if Liverpool beat Aston Villa on Saturday.\"This is the one that matters,\" he said. \"Then Real Madrid and Manchester City. If we get three negative results in the next week, then Slot's job will be genuinely under threat.\"But to suggest he should lose his job on the back of a match [against Palace, in which] he fielded players many fans haven't heard of is ludicrous. \"Slot's been very poor and has made some horrible tactical choices this season that have restricted his best players and left us wide open. We've also had some bad luck and missed too many chances. It's football. He deserves time to turn it around and I back him to do so.\"Fellow fan Ryan agreed it's \"way too soon\" to be talking about getting rid of Slot, but said players need to take responsibility and shoulder some of the blame too.\"We don't turn into a bad team overnight,\" he said. \"But Slot doesn't help himself with some of his decisions - and that is what he can control.\"Liverpool operate differently and I can't see us cutting Slot and his staff so soon. However, results are what count, ultimately, and if things don't improve - and quickly - then we all know how the road ends.\"The players have to step up too, by the way - it shouldn't all be on the manager. Some have been way, way below an acceptable standard for Liverpool.\"'More than footballing reasons behind slump'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jota had two years remaining on his Liverpool contract when he diedLiverpool fan Josh Sexton - who contributes to The Anfield Wrap - told BBC Sport there are a multitude of reasons why this season's form has been suffering.\"Key players are out of form, a few players are struggling for fitness, or suffering from injury issues, and there is a lack of continuity from last season,\" he said.\"A lot of those continuity issues stem from the business done in the summer, most of which was necessary for one reason or another and I don't think many Liverpool fans would look back and say that they regret the departures of any players besides possibly Luis Diaz and the profile of the player that Trent Alexander-Arnold is - the emotion attached to that exit causes this supporter to not miss the man himself as such.\"The variable within all of this is that one player we lost in the summer was lost in the most tragic of circumstances very unexpectedly, and there are more reasons than just footballing ones why that loss is absolutely immeasurable.\"Sexton said the emotions of Mohamed Salah after Liverpool's first game against Bournemouth showed how Diogo Jota's death has impacted not only the players who were his team-mates, but also the new arrivals, who have come into a dressing room that has been hit hard by the loss of a close friend.\"The tributes from within the club and from the supporters serve as a constant celebration of the magnificent human being that we were lucky enough to call one of our own, but of course they can also stir up feelings of grief and loss which can't be easy to perform through at an elite level,\" he added.\"And yet that is exactly what Liverpool have to do with the target on their back as Premier League champions, and I've not noticed any drop in heads or performance per se when those vocal tributes have been paid (the song the fans sing in Jota's memory actually started later than 20 minutes against Manchester United as Cody Gakpo went through on goal and hit the post).\"It will no doubt be having a general impact, but we'd all do well to remember everybody has their own grieving process and give each other the leeway to carry on despite such an unspeakable tragedy.\"'Always going to be a tough season'Earlier this month Liverpool captain Van Dijk addressed the fact that the club was mourning the death of Jota, who died in a car crash in July.\"It was always going to be a tough season,\" he said after a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on 4 October.\"Nobody said that it was going to be plain sailing whatsoever.\"It was always going to be ups and downs for multiple reasons that we shouldn't forget, and all we have to do is stick together.\"Speaking on Radio 5 Live on Wednesday night, former Liverpool full-back Stephen Warnock said: \"You've got a team that's mourning in that changing room. How do the new players integrate into that? It's a horrible situation.\"It has to have an effect. They are human beings.\"One thing I notice every time I come to Anfield or watch Liverpool play is the Diogo Jota song after 20 minutes goes up and there is a 5-10 min spell where the tempo drops completely.\"The players are hearing that song and your mind will wander in that moment to one of their friends and close colleagues. In the changing room his locker is still there, so you're sat with a constant reminder of that person you've lost and that can't be easy. \"Some people will be able to put that to one side but for some it will weigh really heavy on their shoulders.\"Just a lull, or time for change?Media caption, Fans react as Liverpool lose againWe asked if it is too soon to talk about Slot's job being under threat, or if change should not be ruled out.Here are some of your comments:Paschal: Just a lull Liverpool are going through. Slot will turn it around. Just a matter of putting the players in positions they are comfortable and happy to play in. Time to put Joe Gomez at right-back and give him a chance. Let the new players have time to settle in. Patience is needed - it will come right.James: If Slot can't turn things around quickly then his position does need consideration. You can't make the financial commitment Liverpool have made and not see results. People continually mention transition and bedding in, but top, top players should hit the ground running - likewise managers.Karl: He should be given more time. We aren't a knee-jerk reaction team. Everyone is still dealing with the loss of Diogo Jota, and then adding so many new players into the mix. He is still the right man for the job.Barry: Lose the next three and I honestly feel something has to done before we fall too far behind for even a top-four spot.Paul: To suggest Slot is in trouble would be akin to saying last season never happened! We are not, and never have been, a 'sacking club'. We leave desperation to others. The guy has earned a year at least to sort this new team out. The talent is clearly there, but they haven't clicked yet. Time, ladies and gentlemen, please.Terry: Not sure Slot is the right man to get us out of trouble. We spent so much money on players and he doesn't seem to know how to play them. I think he's under pressure now, he needs to win games soon or he's gone.",

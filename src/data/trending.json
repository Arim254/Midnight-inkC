The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "11 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "50 minutes agoLaura Kuenssberg,Presenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergandThomas MackintoshWatch: Chopping and changing of leadership 'not in our national interest', says StarmerSir Keir Starmer has dismissed concerns about his leadership and said he will still be prime minister this time next year.In an exclusive interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said he believes forthcoming elections in Scotland, Wales and England in May are not a \"referendum\" on his government.His comments come after a difficult 2025 for Sir Keir, who has been battling slowing economic growth, poor poll ratings and speculation he could face a leadership challenge.In his recent New Year's Day message, the PM promised to \"defeat the decline and division offered by others\" and insisted 2026 would see people feel \"positive change\" in their lives.Speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said: \"I was elected in 2024 with a five-year mandate to change the country, and that's what I intend to do, to be faithful to that mandate.\"And I will be judged, and I know I'll be judged, when we get to the next election, on whether I've delivered on the key things that matter most to people.\"Parliament returns from the Christmas recess on Monday and the prime minister is set to hold his first Cabinet meeting of 2026 the following day. He is expected to tell ministers: \"I know families across the country are still worried about the cost of living.\"There will be no let-up in our fight to make life better for them.\"In his interview with the BBC, the prime minister vowed to stand firm in his leadership.\"Under the last government, we saw constant chopping and changing of leadership, of teams, it caused utter chaos, utter chaos, and it's amongst the reasons that the Tories were booted out so effectively at the last election,\" Sir Keir said. \"Nobody wants to go back to that. It's not in our national interest. \"We know from that evidence what happens if you go down that chaotic path, and I'm not going to take us back to that kind of chaos.\"I will be sitting in this seat by 2027 and if this long-form interview works, we can try it again in January of next year as well.\"Sir Keir's comments come just over five months before elections to the Welsh Parliament, the Senedd, the Scottish Parliament and to many local authorities in England on 7 May.Each will have potentially huge consequences as Labour is currently in power in the Senedd and runs many of the urban councils in England where local elections are being held.",

    "body": "The front pages of the Sunday papers all feature the same image of Venezuela's leader, Nicolas Maduro, after his capture by the United States. He's pictured in handcuffs, wearing a blindfold and ear defenders, sat on board a US warship bound for New York. \"America's Captive\", says the Observer; \"Nicked\", says the Sun on Sunday.The Sunday Mirror describes the US attack on Venezuela as \"astonishing\", while the Mail on Sunday says the world is reeling from what it calls the \"shock-and-awe raid\". According to the Sunday Times, more than 150 aircraft were involved in the military operation, with a fleet of helicopters moving in to abduct the \"pyjama-clad\" Venezuelan president after air defences in Caracas were immobilised.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the former US national security advisor, John Bolton, warns that removing Mr Maduro alone would be a \"hollow victory for America\". He defends the US action, arguing it was \"entirely justified\" by critical national security interests, but says other key regime figures remain in Caracas and calls on Washington to \"finish the job\".Several leader columns express reservations about the raid on Caracas. \"Might is not right\", argues The Observer, which says the US is \"more feared now ... but less respected\", after it exercised power \"as a bully\". The Sunday Times warns that the US record of intervention in Latin America \"does not bode well\" while The Sunday Express notes that Mr Trump \"now has the responsibility of ensuring a humanitarian catastrophe does not unfold\".Elsewhere, claims that the emergency exit of the Swiss bar where at least 40 people died in a fire \"was always locked\" are highlighted by The Mail on Sunday. The Sunday Times says anger is also growing over suggestions that the venue may have turned a blind eye to underage drinking as hundreds of people celebrated the New Year.The Sunday Telegraph reports that the King has overtaken Princess Anne as the hardest working Royal, despite undergoing weekly cancer treatment. Figures show he conducted 533 engagements last year, while his younger sister carried out 478.And with the headline, \"Nessie's not there\", The Daily Star Sunday says Britain's top Loch Ness Monster expert has come to the conclusion that it doesn't exist. Adrian Shine has spent \"decades searching\" after moving to the Highlands and founding the Loch Ness Project, but now believes the lake doesn't have enough fish to sustain a creature of Nessie's reputed size.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoTom McArthurandLaurence PeterEPA/ShutterstockRoyal Air Force Typhoon jets have joined French aircraft in a joint strike on an underground arms cache in Syria used by the Islamic State group (IS), the UK Ministry of Defence says.\"Careful\" intelligence analysis led officials to believe the facility was storing arms and explosives, the statement said, and was in mountains just north of Palmyra, an ancient site in central Syria.\"Our aircraft used Paveway IV guided bombs to target a number of access tunnels down to the facility... initial indications are that the target was engaged successfully,\" the MoD said.There was no sign of any harm to civilians in the strike late on Saturday and all the aircraft returned safely, the MoD added.Detailed assessment of the strikes is under way but officials believe \"the target was engaged successfully\".The Typhoon FGR4s were supported by a Voyager refuelling tanker.  IS imposed jihadist rule over parts of Syria and Iraq until 2019.\"This action shows our UK leadership, and determination to stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies, to stamp out any resurgence of Daesh and their dangerous and violent ideologies in the Middle East,\" UK Defence Secretary John Healey said.EPA/ShutterstockThe MoD said no civilians were harmed in the strikesRAF aircraft have carried out patrols over Syria to \"prevent any attempted resurgence\" of IS following its defeat at the battle of Baghuz in 2019, the ministry said.\"I want to thank all the members of our armed forces involved in this operation for their professionalism and their courage,\" Healey said.\"They were among thousands of British personnel deployed over Christmas and New Year. This operation, to eliminate dangerous terrorists who threaten our way of life, shows how our armed forces are ready to step up, all year round, keeping Britain secure at home and strong abroad.\" The RAF has been using aerial drones and manned aircraft to strike IS fighters and targets as part of the international coalition since 2014. The United Nations says IS still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.In November, Syria - under the leadership of new President Ahmed al-Sharaa - became the 90th country to join a US-led coalition to combat the group.The coalition, officials say, is aimed at eliminating remaining elements of the so-called Islamic State and stemming the flow of foreign militants to the Middle East.Last month, the US military carried out what it called a \"massive strike\" against IS targets in Syria, following an ambush that killed two American soldiers and a civilian interpreter in Palmyra.",

She had been building up and practising really well. But we just felt this morning it was a little bit too early.\"Great Britain face Greece after their Group E tie against Japan.Henman added: \"I don't think she's necessarily out of this tournament just yet.

Ties at the United Cup comprise of one men's and one women's singles match and a mixed doubles.Billy Harris earned GB a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 victory against Shintaro Mochizuki before Katie Swan, who replaced Raducanu, was beaten 7-6 (7-4) 6-1 by Osaka.Neal Skupski and Olivia Nicholls are representing Britain in the mixed doubles against Yasutaka Uchiyama and Nao Hibino.

HM Coastguard initially responded to reports of a \"number of people in difficulty in the water\" at the seaside town.Police did not provide the gender or age of the second body they recovered, and said the circumstances were not suspicious. Kevin Shoesmith/BBCGeorge Gouldson says he saw three people in the water George Gouldson, 73, was taking photographs of the stormy seas from his car when the incident began.He said he saw people \"running towards the towers\", a local landmark on the promenade.\"I saw three people in the water before others got in. One of the people in the water was a female.\"A bloke was trying to throw a life ring to her, but it wouldn't reach her. The tide just took her. She was swept away, along the length of the beach, towards the rocks. The water was that fierce. \"A load of people were trying to get to her. One bloke got out of the water. I picked him up and sat him against a wall. He looked to be hypothermic.\" BBC/Jessica LaneConditions at the scene have been described as \"horrendous\" as snow and ice warnings apply across much of the UKMr Gouldson, who returned to the scene with his dog on Saturday morning, said he did not see the woman or the two other people emerge from the water.\"It's something you see on television, not in Withernsea,\" he added.\"My mind just won't settle. It's just so sad.\"Janice Holgate, 60, drove 17 miles (27km) from her home in Hull to lay flowers at the scene.She said: \"It breaks my heart what has happened. It's an awful start to the year. I just wanted to do something.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJanice Holgate lays flowers close to the scene of the tragedyWithernsea Methodist Church opened its doors for prayers on Saturday morning.The Reverend Ian Greenfield said he had received messages from all over the country offering support.\"When we realized the severity of it and the tragedy of it, we felt it was really important that we had our church open this morning for people to come along.\"For people to be able to come and pray and to receive emotional support,\" he said.BBC/Jessica LaneMembers of the coastguard resumed searches at first light on SaturdayThe incident was first reported at 15:10 on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.  The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday and resumed at first light.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said teams from Hull, Withernsea, Hornsea and Bridlington were sent to the scene at 06:30 to continue the search.At Withernsea, snow began to fall just after first light and those searching have been battling bitterly cold and windy conditions along with driving snow.Snow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond and a yellow warning is in place for the east coast of England until 23:49 on Saturday.BBC/Amanda WhiteReverend Ian Greenfield says the community has received messages of support from across the UKA police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"Hornsea Inshore Rescue said on Friday it had faced \"horrendous conditions\" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.The operation has involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesRelated internet links",

    "body": "3 hours agoPA MediaMany parts of the UK have experienced cold and snowy weather this winter.  Like people, pets can need extra help to stay warm and safe during very cold conditions. How do I keep my pet warm indoors?Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold.The RSPCA says pets can shiver when they are exposed to low temperatures for too long. This is more noticeable in smaller and short-haired breeds.The PDSA veterinary charity advises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months and adding a few more spaces where they can curl up around the home.Raising their beds off the ground can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like playing or resting in high-up dens or on climbing posts. Experts recommend extra playtime to make sure pets keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help.Your pet may want to eat more to help keep their body temperature up. At the same time, they may also want to drink less, but make sure they have constant access to fresh drinking water to avoid the risk of dehydration.RSPCA: Keeping pets safe in cold weatherPDSA: Pet care advice for winterShould I still walk my dog during cold weather?PA MediaDogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. But some dogs - particularly those with shorter fur - may need extra help staying warm while outside.\"For most dogs, their own lovely fur coat is insulation enough, but those with thin fur, or who are unwell, very old or young, may benefit from a good winter coat,\" according to PDSA's Gemma Renwick. \"Look for something well-fitting, waterproof but with a comfy lining.\"Walk your dog during the day if you can, or if you have to go out in the dark, consider using LED collars or hi-vis leads to ensure they can be seen. Be cautious when letting dogs off the lead in the snow, and supervise them closely as hazards may be hidden. Similarly, keep pets away from frozen water as the ice on ponds and lakes can be thin and may not support their weight. As the temperatures drop, plan for shorter, more frequent walks rather than one long-distance daily hike and if your dog gets wet, make sure you dry them off with a towel as soon as you get home.Any build-up of salt, grit, dirt or snow can be painful, so owners should check and rinse their pet's paws.What about rabbits and guinea pigs during cold weather?Smaller pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs and ferrets can also feel the cold.The PDSA says a sudden drop in temperatures can be a shock to the system for the animals, and recommends moving them inside if they live in outdoor hutches.A shed or car-free garage can offer a good amount of protection from draughts, rain or snow. If you have to bring your animals inside, try and put them in a room which you can keep a bit cooler than the rest of your home. Turn down the radiators if you can. If there is no inside option, the charity advises placing a thick blanket or piece of carpet over their outside living quarters to help keep them warm. Should I keep my cat inside?Angela/BBC Weather WatchersMany cats spend a lot of their time exploring the outdoors. During the day, experts say cats who are used to going outside should continue to do so.But the PDSA advises making sure can easily get back inside through a cat flap whenever they want, or have a warm outside shelter where they can go.Ideally cats should stay inside overnight during periods of very cold weather.The charity also recommends providing litter trays inside, even if your cat usually goes outside so they have a warm toileting option. How should I care for chickens in the winter months?Chickens and hens are incredibly resilient and should typically cope well with a bit of cold weather, the British Hen Welfare Trust says. However, during extreme conditions, the charity recommends:making sure your birds have a robust shelter, and that any hen houses are insulatedfor larger hen houses, putting a cardboard box on its side for your hens to sleep inchecking their water supply regularly to ensure it hasn't frozen checking boundaries regularly to ensure they are safe from predators. Fence posts may become loose in wet weather, giving foxes or badgers easy access to the animals",

    "body": "8 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and west reporterGetty ImagesThe Bearsden shark was discovered near Glasgow in 1982Think of sharks and the most common images that spring to mind will likely be of dangerous predators hunting prey, accompanied by ominous music.  However, a town in the leafy suburbs of Glasgow has its own connection to the famous fish - and it dates back millions of years.In 1982 a complete shark fossil was discovered in Bearsden, in East Dunbartonshire. It was so complete experts could even see the remains of the last meal eaten by the fish, 330 million years after it died.Now a group of local enthusiasts are hoping to install a sculpture of the fish in the town, ensuring the tale of the Bearsden Shark will be remembered for future generations.     The one metre long shark - officially named as the Akmonistion zangerli - was discovered at the Manse Burn in Bearsden, among dozens of other fish and plant samples found during an excavation of the site.According to local legend, some boys in the area had discovered fossils and brought them to the attention of Bearsden fossil hunter Stan Wood, at that time working at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow.He arranged for the excavation to take place throughout the summer of 1982, with the Bearsden shark the most exciting find.\"It's the most complete fossil shark of any kind, anywhere, of any age,\" says Dr Neil Clark, the curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian.  \"It's totally preserved, so every vertebrae and every tooth is in the place it was when it was alive. It's a very useful fossil for understanding what these sharks are like, as before we usually worked with just pieces of teeth or the head.\"For something like the megalodon (usually portrayed in various action and horror films as gigantic) we have no idea how big it really was because we just have the teeth to go on.\"These sharks became extinct during the Triassic period when around 96 per cent of creatures died out – that was far more than during the Cretaceous period which marked the end of the dinosaurs. \" Hunterian MuseumThe fossil is on display at the Hunterian MuseumGiven this was hundreds of millions of years ago, Scotland bore no resemblance to the land it is today, instead being located near the equator.\"What is now Bearsden was part of a lagoon,\" explains Neil Buchanan, an enthusiast on the shark.  \"That lent to the type of fish that were there, shrimps and the like. Then there was some sort of catastrophic event for the shark, which killed it, but it seemed to sink into mud.\"Yet while soft tissue usually rots away, the lack of oxygen caused by the manner of the shark's death and more mud landing on top preserved the fish.A plaque on a small cairn already marks where the discovery was made, but Mr Buchanan and others in the Bearsden Shark Group would now like to see a sculpture in the town as a memento of the shark.\"People are beginning to forget about it, \" he says. \"You mention the Bearsden shark to people and sometimes they have no idea about it.  \"One of the things we have come to realise is that the site itself is isolated from the population, so we came up with the idea of a permanent display in the town centre.\"The quality would hopefully be attractive enough for people locally to look at, and maybe even have visitors come.\"Dr Neil Clark says there are still mysteries to be solved regarding the sharkDespite the shark being so well preserved, Dr Clark says there remain many mysteries about the fish found in a Bearsden burn.\"There is still a lot to be found out about them, especially the structure behind the head,\" he explains. \"There are a lot of different theories. At the time it was found they thought maybe it arched its back and make it look like a huge mouth, but it's so narrow it wouldn't actually look like a mouth, so that theory is out the window. \"Another theory has it as a male shark and perhaps it was a purpose in mating, like for scratching females. \"There is still so much more to be found about these creatures, but we may never discover it. \"Research is still ongoing regarding the things dug out of Bearsden and there's always something new coming out from them - that's what is so magical about it.\"",

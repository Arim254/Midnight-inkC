    "body": "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery had an unhappy 18-month spell in charge of Arsenal that ended in 2019, but can he get the better of his old club on Tuesday?\"After the abuse he took from Arsenal fans, I'd love nothing more than Emery to go back to the Emirates and win,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton.\"He absolutely didn't deserve that. Some of those fans should take a long, hard look at themselves for the way they mocked him. I hope Villa go there and spank them, just because of that.\"Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests.For week 19 - which includes the final games of 2025 on Tuesday, 30 December and the first matches of 2026 on New Year's Day - he takes on singer-songwriter Tom A Smith, who is a Sunderland fan.Smith's latest EP, Say What You Want, is out now. It reached number 14 in the UK record store charts at the end of November.Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below.The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.Image source, Tom A SmithImage caption, Smith has played Glastonbury and BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend, and supported acts such as Sam Fender, Catfish and the Bottlemen and Elton John, who hand-picked him to open his Hyde Park show in 2022Smith is from Houghton-le-Spring, a town just outside Sunderland, and is a lifelong Black Cats fan who is enjoying seeing his side emerge as this season's surprise package.\"My word, it has just been amazing,\" he told BBC Sport. \"It's such a brilliant time to be a Sunderland fan, and also to be from Sunderland.\"I was saying this last season as well, because before then it had been such a long time since I felt so excited before the game every week, where I cannot wait for kick-off.\"Most of the time when I was growing up, it was the opposite. It was absolutely horrible then, but it could not be more different now.\"All you need to do is walk around the city, and go round Keel Square, and you can just feel how much of a buzz there is because of how well the team is doing. Culturally, it is having a massive impact on the city and everyone is in such good spirits all the time - everywhere is thriving.\"Sunderland have been playing Smith's songs at the Stadium of Light since they were still in the Championship, and he says hearing them at games is \"an incredible feeling\".\"Pretty much most matchdays I hear my songs come on now which is amazing,\" he added.\"Back in the Championship a couple of years ago I did notice that every time we got beaten one of my songs played at the end - thankfully they play it when we win now as well!\"Chris Sutton and Tom A Smith were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.Premier League predictionsTuesday, 30 DecemberTurf Moor, 19:30 GMTBurnley have drawn their past two games but they really need a win because they are a little adrift at the bottom, six points from safety.Scott Parker is under a bit of pressure and a few of their fans have called up 606, saying they want a change. I still think they have been competitive, though, even if they have not beaten anyone since 26 October.Newcastle could do with a victory as well, though. They are a strange side because they have been playing quite well but not really getting results. I keep backing them to win, so it is costing me too.I am not going to stop, though. I am going for a rare away win for Eddie Howe's side - and this time they will keep a clean sheet.Sutton's prediction: 0-1Tom's prediction: Burnley have picked up a couple of good points over Christmas but, as tough as it is for me to say this, Newcastle will probably have a little bit too much for them. 0-3AI's prediction: 1-2Stamford Bridge, 19:30Chelsea are fifth but they are on a sticky run at the moment, with only one win in six league games.When they got their draw with 10 men against Arsenal at the end of November, I thought they were in the title race, but they have completely fallen away.Bournemouth's poor run of results goes back even further, however. After climbing to second place at the end of October, they have not won any of their past nine matches.It is a concerning time for their manager, Andoni Iraola, because this might be Antoine Semenyo's last game for the Cherries. Maybe losing three of their first-choice defenders in the summer - Dean Huijsen (to Real Madrid), Milos Kerkez (to Liverpool), and Illia Zabarnyi (to Paris St-Germain) is catching up with them too.I am not sure what is going wrong for the Cherries because they are still so aggressive in the way they press and play, but they are conceding a lot of goals and Brentford played right through them in the first half at the weekend.It is only because West Ham have been so rotten that Bournemouth are still nine points clear of the relegation zone. I still always think Iraola's side will score, but I am backing Enzo Maresca's side to win the battle of two very patchy teams.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: Bournemouth started the season so well and they have got a really exciting team with players like Semenyo. Everyone is trying to sign him at the moment but when he spent a few months on loan with Sunderland in League One in 2020 I must admit I didn't think too much of him.The Cherries are struggling for form and this is a tough game for them. Chelsea have been a bit shaky recently too but I'd still back them to win this at Stamford Bridge. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-1City Ground, 19:30Everton beat Nottingham Forest comfortably at the start of December, but that was with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye and Jack Grealish in their team.It's possible Grealish is back from a virus to play in this game, but Dewsbury-Hall and Ndiaye will be much missed and we saw how much it affected Everton's firepower when they played without all three of them in their draw at Burnley.Forest were very good against Manchester City on Saturday and will feel they should have got something out of that game.Sean Dyche was unhappy with City's winner but, watching it back, you could see Morgan Gibbs-White hooked his leg around Nico O'Reilly and tried to drag him down with him, so it was good refereeing to suss that out and not give the foul to Forest.Even so, it was an impressive Forest display. Because of that, and because of who Everton will be missing, I am backing Dyche to get the better of his old team this time.Sutton's prediction: 1-0Tom's prediction: I've been surprised by Forest's drop-off in form this season and it just shows how European football can affect teams when they don't have a big enough squad - that's the one thing that worries me about Sunderland next season when we are in the Champions League! Sorry, I'm maybe getting a bit carried away there!Anyway, I am backing Forest to win this one at home. Everton have got a good side but they can sometimes struggle going forward - they need a centre-forward. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-1London Stadium, 19:30Things are turning uglier by the week for West Ham. They are in a real relegation battle now, and their boss Nuno Espirito Santo is absolutely desperate for a win, but it is hard to see where it will come from.Brighton are inconsistent but they have shown their quality by pushing Liverpool and Arsenal close in recent weeks. I don't see anything other than a Seagulls victory here.The Hammers are so low on confidence that even if this is a tight game, you get the feeling they will lose it, like they did against Fulham on Saturday.Sutton's prediction: 1-2Tom's prediction: If Brighton show up, they can beat anyone but they are just a little bit too inconsistent. West Ham are struggling but again I am going with the home team here.I don't think the Hammers will go down, either. They have got to find some form but, if they do, they have got too much quality for that to happen. 2-1AI's prediction: 2-2Emirates Stadium, 20:15I love what Villa are doing. You just keep thinking their winning run can't continue, which is why I had Chelsea down to beat them - and, again, I was wrong about that.Villa have the most points (18)  from losing positions in the Premier League this season and they just do not lie down.We saw that again against Chelsea, who pummelled them for an hour before Watkins came on to make it 11 Villa wins in a row.It was only this time last year that Arsenal put a bid in for Watkins, who supports them as well, but he stayed at Villa and if you were writing a script you would have him down as getting the winner again here.Even so, I just have a feeling Arsenal will find a way to win this. I am expecting the Gunners to find another gear or two very soon, but this might be more of a battle for them, that they have to get through.There will be some nervy moments for Mikel Arteta's side again, that's for sure, but I reckon they will hang on for the win, just about.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: Wow, what a game this is. It is incredible that Villa just keep on winning and Morgan Rogers is such a fantastic player. Other than someone like Erling Haaland, if I could have any player for Sunderland at the moment, it would probably be him.Arsenal have to keep winning games to hold off City, but I can see them dropping points here. I think Pep Guardiola's side will win the league, too. The thing with Arsenal is that they do get nervy and you can see them having a dip, and drawing games like this. I don't see that with City now. 2-2AI's prediction: 2-0Old Trafford, 20:15Lots of Manchester United fans had a pop at me, again, for my negativity about their team before they played Newcastle United.I know Ruben Amorim's side proved me wrong by winning that game, but I think those fans would have to admit it was a very negative performance.Despite that, I am going to back United to win this week - so maybe that will bring some positivity back to the team, too. They need it.If it were down to me, though, I would relegate Wolves now and just chop them out of the league. They are more lambs than wolves at the moment and to have only picked up two points from 18 games is absolutely pathetic.They are still scrapping to get something for Rob Edwards but they are desperately poor.Edwards has lost all seven of his games since taking charge and has only seen his side score three goals. Surely he wishes he had stayed at Middlesbrough?Sutton's prediction: 2-0Tom's prediction: I really struggle to see Wolves picking up any points, whoever they play. They just lack so much quality and confidence too. United will have far too much for them. 3-0AI's prediction: 2-1Thursday, 1JanuarySelhurst Park, 17:30Crystal Palace have lost three league games in a row, while Fulham have won three in a row.It's not long since I was concerned Fulham could be getting dragged into a relegation scrap, but they are looking up the table now and are level on points with Palace after moving into the top half.I watched Palace's defeat against Tottenham on Sunday and they just looked knackered, but they still created some chances and were unlucky not to take something from the game.On form, you'd go with Fulham again here but I actually think Palace will deal with them much better than West Ham did.The Eagles could do with getting a break, as in a mid-season break, but they just need a bit of luck in front of goal too and they will be back to winning ways.Sutton's prediction: 2-0Tom's prediction: Fulham are decent and seem to stay in every game, but I am going with Palace here. On their day, they are one of the best sides in the league. 1-0AI's prediction: 1-1Anfield, 17:30I correctly backed Leeds to get a point when these sides met Elland Road a few weeks back, but this is at Anfield and, besides that, Liverpool look a lot more confident now.This is a different Leeds, too, of course. They have got real belief at the moment and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has scored seven goals in six games, is going to be hard to stop.But Florian Wirtz seems to be coming to the fore for Liverpool now and they are building their confidence back up.Arne Slot's side are back up to fourth place and although when you watch them you can see they have still got weaknesses in their team, I'm expecting them to make it four league wins in a row here.It is not actually impossible that they could be back in the title race soon, either. After this game, Slot's side travel to Fulham and Arsenal next week so let's see where they are then.Sutton's prediction: 2-1Tom's prediction: This finished 3-3 at Elland Road and it was an amazing game. Leeds have found a system that works and Calvert-Lewin keeps scoring goals, but it feels like Liverpool are starting to find a bit of form again at Anfield. 3-1AI's prediction: 3-1Gtech Community Stadium, 20:00Spurs have got the best away record in the Premier League again, thanks to their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday that saw them climb to 11th place, but Brentford are absolutely flying at home too.So, how do I call this one? Let's be honest, Spurs are not an attractive team to watch at the moment, and they are very stuffy and scrappy whether they win or not.Their form on the road will probably give Thomas Frank a bit of confidence going back to his old club, and he will get a good reception there, I am sure of that.But Brentford have snuck up to eighth after taking seven points from their past three games, and they won't lack belief either.Anyone can beat anyone in this part of the table, which doesn't help me when it comes to making a prediction. I can't pick a winner here, so I am going for a draw.Sutton's prediction: 1-1Tom's prediction: I saw Jordan Henderson make his debut for Sunderland and he deserves more recognition. He is up there with Granit Xhaka as one of the signings of the season, because of his influence on Brentford.The Bees are a good side, especially at home, but Thomas Frank and Spurs need something here. I don't think they will win it, though. 1-1AI's prediction: 1-2Stadium of Light, 20:00City did not have it all their own way when they beat Sunderland at Etihad Stadium, but they dismantled them in the end and they are capable of doing the same at the Stadium of Light.It is hard to see anyone stopping City at the moment, really. Rayan Cherki is a big talent, and with such quick feet. Phil Foden almost scored against Forest on Saturday, and when Haaland draws a blank, like he did in that game, you know a goal is not far away.Still, Sunderland have the aggression that saw them rattle Arsenal and they are so well organised defensively too.That's why they still haven't lost at home this season, and I feel bad for writing them off so often, but I am sorry to say I am going to do it again.I feel like City have found their flow so I can't back against them, but I am expecting Sunderland to put up one heck of a fight.Sutton's prediction: 1-3Tom's prediction: My heart is telling me one thing, and my head is telling me another!From my heart, this is the sort of game we just win. I don't know if we will, but even just the fact we are at home to City on New Year's Day again really gives me that feeling - I've got very good memories of Ji Dong-won getting our winner against them on 1 January 2012.With my head, though, it is going to be tough. We had chances at the Etihad a few weeks ago but, being realistic, I think we need a full-strength side to get anything from City and we don't have that at the moment because we have lost players to the Africa Cup of Nations.We definitely won't have enough to win the game, but I am never going to say we will get beaten - I can't do that. So, with my fingers crossed, I am going to say we will get our noses ahead but then City will pile on the pressure and I don't see us absorbing it and holding out. 1-1AI's prediction: 0-3How did Sutton do last week?The outcome of week 18, the festive fixtures on 26, 27 & 28 December, went down to the last of the 10 matches, Tottenham's 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace.With only that game left to play, Chris' guest, The Wellermen singer Jonny Stewart, was leading the way on 110 points and could only be beaten by AI, which was 10 points behind him.The BBC readers were another 30 points back and needed an exact score to tie, while Chris was already out of contention, on 50 points.Stewart went for a 2-2 draw, Sutton chose 0-0 and the readers backed Palace to win 2-1 - but it was AI who picked up 10 points by going for a 2-1 Spurs win.That meant AI and Stewart shared the weekly victory - they both got five correct results, including two exact scores, for a tally of 110 points.Chris also got five correct results but with no exact scores for 50 points, while the BBC readers got four correct results with one exact score, leaving them on 70 points.\"I've tried to change the rules so ties aren't worth anything but unfortunately that wasn't allowed,\" Sutton said.\"It means I'm off the top of the table - for now - but I still think I was unlucky with some of my predictions last week.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoHelen Catt,Political correspondentandIan AikmanReutersForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper has launched a review into what she calls \"serious information failures\" in the case of British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd El Fattah. In a letter to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Cooper said she, Sir Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy \"were all unaware\" of Mr Abd El Fattah's historical tweets, which they consider to be \"abhorrent\".It comes after the Conservatives and Reform UK called for the activist to be stripped of UK citizenship and deported after social media posts emerged in which he called for Zionists to be killed.Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised, saying he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Mr Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after the democracy activist was freed from prison in Egypt.On Monday, Sir Keir said the resurfaced tweets were \"absolutely abhorrent\" and said the government was \"taking steps to review the information failures in this case\".\"With the rise of antisemitism, and recent horrific attacks, I know this has added to the distress of many in the Jewish community in the UK,\" he added.Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, who led the criticism of Sir Keir's welcome for Mr Abd El Fattah, swiftly responded by renewing his call for the activist to be removed from the UK. On Monday evening, Reform UK said that it would change the law to ensure Mr Abd El Fattah could be stripped of his British citizenship and deported.The party's leader, Nigel Farage, said previous Conservative and Labour governments had \"opened our doors to evil people\".In her letter to the Foreign Affairs committee, Cooper said work started over the weekend revealed that previous foreign secretaries and prime ministers had made public statements on Mr Abd El Fattah's case \"without all relevant information\".She added that current and former ministers were \"never briefed on these tweets when they spoke publicly about the case\", and the civil servants in charge of the case \"were also unaware\" of them.Cooper said it was clear there had been an \"unacceptable failure\" and that longstanding due diligence procedures had been \"completely inadequate for this situation\".The foreign secretary added she was \"deeply concerned\" that the re-emergence of these tweets, alongside social media posts welcoming Mr Abd El Fattah's return posted by her and other members of the government, had \"added to the distress felt by Jewish communities in the UK and I very much regret that\".She told the committee she had asked the most senior civil servant in the Foreign Office to review the \"serious information failures in this case\" and the broader systems that were in place in the department for carrying out due diligence on high-profile consular and human rights cases to make sure they were working properly and that \"all necessary lessons are learned\".In one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Mr Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he appears to say he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".Earlier on Monday, Mr Abd El Fattah \"unequivocally\" apologised for the tweets.He said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Mr Abd El Fattah's release.The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair.He was granted British citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother, when the Conservatives were in power.Shadow home secretary Chris Philp, who was an immigration minister until September 2021, said he was not aware of Mr Abd El Fattah's tweets at that time, but he now believed the activist \"should have his citizenship revoked\".\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday.On the same programme, Labour's Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Foreign Affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Mr Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she said.\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it, so he is a British citizen. The British government has been doing their utmost to get him back into the country and out of jail.\"A government source said Mr Abd El Fatteh arrived in the country as a British citizen and there were no legal avenues available to block his entry, even if officials had been aware of his previous social media posts.It is understood that Downing Street believes there is a high bar to someone having their citizenship revoked because they must have either obtained citizenship by fraud or be deemed to pose a significant national security threat - a test unlikely to be met in this case.A writer and software developer, Mr Abd El Fattah rose to prominence during a 2011 uprising that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.He has spent more than a decade of his life behind bars and his release in September after a presidential pardon followed a long campaign by his family and lobbying by the British government.In October, he said he was \"learning how to get back into life\" in an interview with the BBC from Cairo.",

    "body": "Passengers aboard a cruise ship that ran aground in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Saturday will be flown back to Australia, after efforts to refloat the vessel failed.The Australian-flagged Coral Adventurer became stuck on a reef off the eastern coast of PNG at around 05:25 local time on Saturday. The 80 passengers and 44 crew members are safe and unharmed, and the passengers, who departed from Cairns in northern Australia on 18 December, will be flown back there.The same ship made headlines earlier this year when it left behind an elderly woman on a remote island on the Great Barrier Reef. Her body was found the following day, and an investigation is ongoing. In the latest incident, the Coral Adventurer was transiting through Morobe, Madang and Sepik provinces when it hit strong sea currents and sailed onto the reef, Morobe's Police Commander Chief Superintendent Samson Siguyaru told the ABC's Pacific Beat programme.The ship was on a six-degree list to the port side - meaning it was tilting to the left, the NMSA said. After inspections, authorities determined that the vessel was not damaged, and there was no environmental pollution or spillage.However a detention notice has been issued, Ch Supt Siguyaru said, which means the ship has been deemed unseaworthy - at least temporarily - and is not allowed to leave the location \"until all the processes are cleared\".Attempts on Sunday to free the ship by using its own engines and a tug boat were unsuccessful, PNG authorities told the ABC.The ship's operator, Coral Expeditions, said on Monday that it would end the tour a day early and fly passengers back to Australia, the public broadcaster reported.According to its website, Coral Expeditions has been running tours to PNG for about 20 years. Morobe's provincial governor, Rainbo Paita, told the ABC that the vessel took a route not usually used by local operators because the reef is known to be \"very high there\".Coral Expeditions has been contacted for comment.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterPA MediaBetty Brown said she was accepting the honour on behalf of all the victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandalThe oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has been appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her services to justice after campaigning against wrongful prosecutions.Betty Brown, 92, ran the Annfield Plain Post Office in County Durham with her late husband Oswall from 1985. But they were forced out in 2003 after spending more than £50,000 of their savings to cover non-existent shortfalls.She recently received her long-awaited settlement from one of the government's compensation schemes.Mrs Brown told BBC Breakfast she accepted the recognition in the New Year Honours list on behalf of all the victims of the scandal.\"Every one of them should have an OBE,\" she said. \"Every one of them for what they've [Post Office] put us through and what we have stood solid and faithful for. I did it for justice.\"The Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully prosecuted because of it providing incorrect information. Thousands more, like Mrs Brown, were forced to make up for the alleged losses at their branches across the UK.The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK.Mrs Brown said she was \"honoured and humbled\" to be made an OBE, adding she had finally \"been heard by the system\".Mrs Brown is not the first Post Office campaigner to be recognised in the New Year Honours list. A year ago four former sub-postmasters turned campaigners were honoured for their services to justice, and Sir Alan Bates - who was featured in the ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\" - was knighted in 2024.Betty Brown and her husband spent more than £50,000 of their own money to cover shortfalls which did not exist The 92-year-old was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Sir Alan against the Post Office.Her branch had been one of the most successful in the region but eventually she had to sell it at a loss.Talking about what happened, she previously said it \"absolutely destroyed my whole life\".Both Mrs Brown and Sir Alan were part of the Group Litigation Order compensation scheme, and those claimants were offered the option of taking a fixed sum of £75,000 or pursuing their own settlement.After receiving her payout in November 2025, she told the BBC: \"At last, after 26 years, they've recognised justice,\" and added: \"pity they took so long.\"A government spokesperson said: \"We must never lose sight of the Horizon scandal's human impact on postmasters and their families, which the Horizon inquiry has highlighted so well.\"Betty Brown has been a fierce advocate for postmasters and this government has now paid out over £1.3bn to more than 10,000 victims.When the first report of the official inquiry into the scandal was published in July, the Post Office said it apologised \"unreservedly\" for the suffering \"caused to postmasters and their loved ones\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporterThe Traitors and former Strictly Come Dancing host Claudia Winkleman is to host her own chat show on BBC One and iPlayer, in spring 2026.  The BBC announcement, which confirms recent industry reports the show was in the pipeline, adds it will be produced by So Television, which is also behind Graham Norton's award-winning chat show. \"I can't quite believe it and I'm incredibly grateful to the BBC for this amazing opportunity,\" Winkleman said. \"I'm obviously going to be awful, that goes without saying, but I'm over the moon they're letting me try.\"The new role follows her departure from Strictly Come Dancing alongside co-host Tess Daly, having presented it together for more than a decade.Winkleman's chat show will \"welcome the biggest names from the worlds of film, television, music and beyond to her sofa for lively conversation with the help of a studio audience\", the BBC said.\"Claudia is a true national treasure - warm, witty and endlessly entertaining,\" said the corporation's head of entertainment commissioning, Kalpna Patel-Knight.\"She has an extraordinary ability to put people at ease and bring out the very best in them, whether they're global superstars or members of the audience.\"So Television's managing director, Graham Stuart, said Winkleman matched Norton's ability to make the \"Friday night talk show slot\" a \"dazzling appointment to view\". \"How can you possibly follow that? By booking a host equally as brilliant. So we have.\"The BBC said further details on the show and when it would be broadcast would be \"announced in due course\".",

    "body": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied allegations by Russia that Ukraine launched a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences, and accused Moscow of trying to derail peace talks. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Kyiv had launched an attack overnight using 91 long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on Putin's state residence in Russia's northwestern Novgorod region.Russia said it would now review its position in peace negotiations. It is not yet clear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack.Zelensky dismissed the claim as \"typical Russian lies\", intended to give the Kremlin an excuse to continue attacks on Ukraine. He said that Russia had previously targeted government buildings in Kyiv.Zelensky added on X: \"It is critical that the world doesn't stay silent now. We cannot allow Russia to undermine the work on achieving a lasting peace.\"In a statement shared on Telegram on Monday, Lavrov said all of the 91 drones he claimed were launched at Putin's residence were intercepted and destroyed by Russian air defence systems.He added that there were no reports of casualties or damage as a result of the attack.\"Given the final degeneration of the criminal Kyiv regime, which has switched to a policy of state terrorism, Russia's negotiating position will be revised,\" he said.But he added that Russia does not intend to exit the negotiating process with the US, Russian news agency Tass reported.The claim by Moscow comes after talks between the US and Ukraine in Florida on Sunday, where Presidents Trump and Zelensky discussed a revised peace plan to end the war.Zelensky said the US had offered Ukraine security guarantees for 15 years, and Trump said an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters, and there was little sign of progress on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region - which Russia wants to seize in full.Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Russia has previously rejected key parts of the plan under discussion.The White House said on Monday that President Trump had \"concluded a positive call\" with Putin, following the US-Ukraine talks. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide, told reporters on Monday that during the call, Putin had pointed out the alleged attack on his residence happened \"almost straight after what the US had considered to be a successful round of talks\".Ushakov said: \"The US president was shocked by this information, he was angry and said he couldn't believe such mad actions. It was stated that this will no doubt affect the US approach to working with Zelensky\".During a later press conference, Trump initially appeared to say he did not know about the alleged incident, but later told reporters that he was told about it by Putin and was \"very angry\" about it. Asked if the US had seen any evidence supporting Russia's claim, he responded: \"Well we'll find out. You're saying maybe the attack didn't take place - that's possible too, I guess. But President Putin told me this morning it did\". ",

    "body": "5 hours agoPritti MistryBusiness reporterBeyoncé has been declared a billionaire by Forbes, making her the fifth musician to join its list of the world's wealthiest people.The American star has joined an elite group of musicians with 10-figure fortunes, Forbes reports, including Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Bruce Springsteen and her husband Jay-Z, who the business magazine lists as having a net worth of $2.5bn (£1.85bn).Earlier this month, Forbes estimated Beyoncé's net worth of $800m (£593m) and predicted she would cross the billionaire threshold for the first time following years of success.Her 2023 Renaissance World Tour grossed nearly $600m, making her one of the biggest pop music icons in the world alongside Taylor Swift.Beyoncé produced a film of the concert performance, which was her first solo tour in seven years, and distributed it directly via a deal with the AMC theater chain, which saw her pocketing nearly half of the film's $44m (£33m) global box office gross.Her 2024 album Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music, was met with critical acclaim and won album of the year at the Grammy Awards - the first time Beyoncé had won the prestigious award, despite being nominated four times.Forbes estimates the Cowboy Carter tour - which included guest appearances from Jay-Z, two of their three children and former Destiny's Child bandmates - racked up a total of more than $400m in ticket sales and another $50m in merchandise sold at the shows.While the tour broke ticket records at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London and Stade De France in Paris, it was beset with slow ticket sales with promoters slashing some prices in a bid to fill seats.However, it was the highest top-priced ticket of any artist visiting the UK in 2025 at £950, with the cheapest costing £71.A special halftime show for Netflix's first Christmas Day NFL game amassed an estimated $50m, on top of $10m for a string of Levi's commercials, Forbes said.Bloomberg, which runs its own billionaire index, included Selena Gomez among its list of musicians - with a reported net worth of $1.3bn (£962m) in 2024. But Forbes has disputed this figure, instead estimating Gomez to be worth $700m (£518m).",

    "body": "Anthony Joshua in 'horror crash' and honours for 'pride of England'28 minutes agoThe car crash involving British ex-world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in Nigeria makes several front pages. The Sun says the boxer was \"inches from death\" and \"cried in pain as he was pulled from the wreckage\" of the \"horror crash\". \"Nigeria nightmare\" is the Daily Star's headline, which says Joshua was \"miraculously pulled alive from a horror car crash\". The Daily Mirror also leads with Joshua's crash, reporting he is in a stable condition in hospital. The paper also features the King's New Year Honours list on its front page, writing that actor Idris Elba will receive a knighthood. \"Arise, Sir Idris\", it proclaims.England's Lionesses \"have dominated\" the New Years Honours, the i Paper reports. \"Pride of England\" is the paper's headline, listing some of the soccer stars to receive knighthoods, including the Lioness manager Sarina Wiegman, captain Leah Williamson, and teammates Alex Greenwood, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway and Ella Toone.Downing Street is facing a \"furious backlash\" over democracy activist Alaa Abd El Fattah being \"welcomed\" back to the UK, the Daily Mail writes. The paper says the welcome occurred \"despite fury over [the] Egyptian dissident's anti-Semitic and anti-British tweets\". The recently released Egyptian-British national arrived in the UK on 26 December before some of his old social media posts and messages resurfaced in which he called for Zionists to be killed. Mr Abd El Fattah has apologised, saying he understood \"how shocking and hurtful\" the posts were.The Daily Express also leads with the backlash against No 10 over Mr Abd El Fattah's case, writing Sir Keir Starmer \"refuses to deport Egyptian 'extremist'\". The government has announced a review into \"serious information failures\" relating to the activist's case.The Daily Telegraph leads by alleging Mr Abd El Fattah's engaged with a post on Facebook claiming he is the \"victim of a 'Zionist campaign'\". The paper says the account appeared to like a post that was re-sharing a separate post featuring those claims. Energy secretary Ed Miliband plans to set out a proposal of \"£13bn over the next four years to reduce carbon emissions from Britain's 30 million homes\", according to the Times. Labour ministers hope \"grants to install solar panels, heat pumps and battery storage\" will help lead to \"zero bill\" homes \"paying little or no money for power\", the paper says.\"US stocks eclipsed by rest of world' reads the headline on the Financial Times, reporting on \"a rare year of underperformance for Wall Street\". The paper identifies multiple reasons for investor \"unease\" in the US, including \"worries about high valuations, a Chinese artificial intelligence breakthrough and Donald Trump's radical economic policies\". \"Polls reveals rise in ethno-nationalist approach to identity\" reads the Guardian's top story, reporting the number of people who associate \"Britishness\" with birthplace has nearly doubled in two years. \"About one in three people (36%) thought a person must be born in Britain to be truly British\", according to the paper, citing a recent survey conducted by the Institute for Public Policy Research.The Independent leads with its own survey findings that \"more than half of British voters want [a] new military alliance without America to counter threat from [Vladimir] Putin\". It says 55% of those polled want the UK to enter a new \"Europe defence alliance\", while only 11% opposed it.Related Internet Links",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "16 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterReutersReform UK have unveiled GB News presenter and academic turned activist Matt Goodwin as their candidate to stand in the Gorton and Denton by-election.Speaking at a press conference, Goodwin said he was \"not part of the establishment\" or the \"Westminster blob\" and promised to give people in the constituency \"a voice\" in Parliament.The by-election in the Greater Manchester constituency was triggered by the resignation of Andrew Gwynne, who stepped down for health reasons. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham had hoped to stand to be the constituency's MP but was blocked by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, a move that has angered some MPs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who chairs the committee, said Labour's resources should be \"focused on the elections that we must have, not the elections that we don't have to have\".If Burnham had been successful in a by-election it would have triggered a mayoral election to replace him in Greater Manchester.Around 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter urging the NEC to reconsider its decision. At the 2024 general election, Labour won the seat with a 13,000 majority. Reform UK came second with 5,000 votes, narrowly beating the Green Party into third party. Other parties are yet to announce their candidates for the by-election, which is expected to take place on 26 February. Goodwin said the by-election was \"a referendum on Keir Starmer\".\"It's a chance for hard-working, law-abiding people, taxpaying people from this seat to have their say on Keir Starmer and to make political history,\" he said. He told the audience \"Manchester made me\" adding that his grandfather worked at a steel factory in the city while his mother worked for the University of Salford, which Goodwin later attended.He said that as a student he had delivered pizzas in the Gorton and Denton area. Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell said Goodwin \"represents the kind of politics that will drive a wedge between communities in Manchester\".\"They [Reform] just offer division, animosity, and hatred – not the unity and pride which our city stands for,\" she added.Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokesperson Lisa Smart said: \"Goodwin has made a career out of talking our country down - he is a professional wind-up merchant, more interested in chasing headlines than putting an end to the cost of living crisis facing families.\"As an academic, Goodwin taught and researched politics, writing books on populism, Brexit and the rise of UKIP, another right-wing party which was also led by Nigel Farage.In recent years he has slightly moved away from studying the politics of the right to becoming an activist, frequently speaking at Reform UK events. Writing in 2023, he said he had been \"a fully paid-up member of the liberal left\" but now found himself \"in a very different space\". Speaking to Political Thinking with Nick Robinson in 2024, he said the Brexit referendum was one turning point when his approach to politics changed.\"I saw essentially many people around me, 90% of people in universities decide that half of the country were racists and ignorant thickos… because they happened to vote for something that the elite class didn't believe in,\" he told the podcast.He said he did not vote in the Brexit referendum but became \"a black sheep\" among academics after arguing that the vote should be implemented.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoPhilippa RoxbyHealth reporterParents in the UK are being warned not to feed their babies using a particular batch of Aptamil First Infant Formula made by Danone.The company is recalling the product because it contains a toxin, called cereulide, which can cause vomiting.The Food Standards Agency (FSA) says the only batch affected is the 800g pack coded EXP 31-10-2026 - no other batches are at risk.Customers who still have some of this batch at home can return it to the shop where they bought it for a full refund with or without a receipt, says the FSA.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed by cooking, or when making the infant milk, the FSA says.If it's consumed it can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps developing quickly.Jodie Wild, head of incidents at the FSA, said: \"Ongoing investigations have identified that the contamination originated from a shared third-party ingredient supplier. \"As a result of these investigations, Danone is recalling one batch of Aptamil product due to the presence of cereulide.\"The affected batch was sold between May and July 2025 and the expiry date, batch and time can be found on the lower back of the pack.Earlier this month, another food giant, Nestle, issued a global recall of specific batches of its infant formula product over concerns they contained the same toxin, meaning they were unsafe for babies to consume.At the time, Nestle said the problem was caused by an ingredient provided by one of its suppliers.The FSA urged parents who had any of the affected products left, to stop using them and switch to an alternative formula.If you have fed it to your baby and are concerned, contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice, it added.The Food Standards Agency said it was working with manufacturers to trace all  products that may have used ingredients from the supplier, and ensure all affected products are removed from sale.",

Writing on Instagram, Rachel Duffy said she was \"heartbroken\" at the death of her \"beautiful wee mummy\". On Friday, she became the first female Traitor to win the BBC show. Throughout the series, Duffy spoke about her mum's battle with Parkinson's Disease and also dementia.During the show, Duffy from Newry in Northern Ireland, had said she wanted to take her mum on holiday to create memories.Speaking to BBC News NI following her win, she said she was looking forward to treating her family, and her mum in particular. \"I rang my mummy this morning… I can't wait to come home and give her a big hug and say what will we do?\"\"Anything you want let's go do it. As long as I get to spoil my family that's all I care about,\" she added.\"She [Rachel's mum] didn't get all the twists and the turns but she's enjoyed watching it. She's very proud.\"Wanted to win 'for mummy'Duffy, as well as her co-traitor Stephen, managed to win the competition in Friday night's final to take home half of the show's £95,750 prize pot.Rachel opened up about her mum during her time on the show, and in the final episode, she became emotional as she talked about how she wanted to spend the prize money making memories with her family.\"When you know her [Rachel's mum] memories are going and you have an opportunity to help her create the nicest ones ever, that is very precious,\" she said. Speaking after the final, Rachel's sister Joanne said how she wished to spend her winnings showed her sister's true character.\"Because Rachel wanted to get in there and get that money for mummy and, what she wanted it for, meant that it meant so much more than just the money.\"In a statement on social media, Rachel asked for privacy as her family \"grieves during this difficult time\".'Not easy to speak publicly' The chief executive of Dementia UK Hilda Hayo has offered condolences to the family and praised Rachel for \"candidly sharing her experience of dementia, and helping to raise awareness of the condition\". \"We thank Rachel for her honesty, we know it is not easy to speak publicly about the impact dementia can have, but in doing so she will have encouraged others to reach out for the support they need,\" she said in a statement.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNaomi ClarkeandPeter Gillibrand,BBC NewsbeatArctic Monkeys' drummer has said making music together is something the band \"will always do\" after rumours swirled that their latest song would be their last.The rock group released Opening Night, their first new song since 2022 album The Car, as part of a new charity album last week.Matt Helders told BBC Radio 1's New Music Show it was an \"easy yes\" when the band were asked to join.He said there were no imminent plans to get back into the recording studio, but ruled nothing out and said making music was \"something we love to do\".Opening Night appears on Help(2), a compilation featuring more than 30 artists including Olivia Rodrigo, Wet Leg and The Last Dinner Party.Released on 6 March, the project will raise funds for War Child - a charity set up to help children living through war.\"Everyone agrees that kids shouldn't be in a situation like that,\" Matt told DJ Jack Saunders.\"Our enthusiam to be involved in this album was at an all-time high. \"It was an opportunity for us to do a new song and get back together for the first time in a couple of years and see if we could still do it.\"The Sheffield band have built up a devoted following since they released debut album Whatever People I Say I Am, That's What I'm Not in 2006. It became the UK's fastest-selling debut of all time, and the four-piece went on to release a string of number one albums.Matt and his bandmates, singer Alex Turner, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O'Malley were behind 2007's Favourite Worst Nightmare, 2011's Suck It And See and 2013's AM. Their last release, The Car, climbed to number two in the UK album charts.Asked whether they needed a reason to get back to writing music, Matt told the New Music Show he didn't feel there needed to be one. He said the studio was the band's \"happy place\" and somewhere \"it feels natural\" for them to be.He said \"time will tell\" if this latest project inspires them to create more music.\"I think we went into this knowing it was a one-off,\" he said.\"But then, having done it, we probably went away feeling like we just had a lot of fun making this record.\"There's no conversations about it, but it's definitely something we love to do and we'll always do.\"  Arctic Monkeys superfan Robbie Lees, who makes social media content about the band, says he hopes this inspires the group to work on new music again. \"Maybe that's the little spark they needed to get back in the studio and think longer-term,\" the 26-year-old tells BBC Newsbeat. \"As a fan, that makes me very, very happy to hear that he calls it his happy place and it's brought them back together after going off and doing their (own) things for a bit.\"Fellow fan Gracie Eccles, 22, tells Newsbeat that hearing that the band are not hanging up their guitars is \"music to my ears\" following speculation online the new song could be their last hurrah.\"I think it's incredible to see my favourite artists supporting a cause like War Child and seeing how they came back for this cause,\" she says.\"It just says a lot more about the band, I think, it's not just about the music for them.\"",

    "body": "34 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterPornhub has announced it will restrict access to its website in the UK from February.Under the changes from 2 February, only people who have previously made a Pornhub account will be able to access its content.The company blames what it says is the \"failure\" of Online Safety Act (OSA) requirements for some sites to use age verification to stop children seeing pornography online.In October, Pornhub's parent company, Aylo, said the requirement had caused traffic to the website to fall by 77%.The regulator Ofcom said at the time tougher age checks were fulfilling their purpose of stopping children stumbling across inappropriate material. The BBC has approached Ofcom for comment on Pornhub's announcement.Pornhub remains the UK's largest porn platform, according to web tracker Similarweb.But from 2 February, only those who have previously signed up for an account with the platform and gone through its age verification process will able to use it.Alex Kekesi, head of community and brand at Pornhub's parent company Aylo, said in a statement it was a \"difficult decision\".\"Our sites, which host legal and regulated porn, will no longer be available in the UK to new users, but thousands of irresponsible porn sites will still be easy to access.\"She said the platform initially complied with OSA obligations \"because we wanted to believe that a determined and prepared regulator in Ofcom could take poor legislation and manage to enforce compliance in a meaningful way\".But six months after age check requirements were introduced to stop children accessing adult content, Kekesi said the company's experience \"strongly suggests that the OSA has failed to achieve that objective\".Those attempting to access Pornhub in the UK after 2 February will effectively be met with \"a wall\" instead of site content, she told reporters in a press conference on Tuesday.The same restrictions will apply to other porn sites owned by Aylo, including YouPorn and Redtube.Solomon Friedman of Ethical Capital Partners (ECP), which owns Aylo, said the company believed Ofcom was \"working in good faith\" to enforce age check requirements.\"The problem here, however, is not the regulator - it is the law,\" he said.\"You have a dedicated regulator working in good faith, but unfortunately, the law they are operating under cannot possibly succeed,\" Friedman added.He said six months after the requirement for sites allowing sexually explicit content took effect in the UK, people were still able to easily access porn - such as by searching for it online.The company reiterated its position that device manufacturers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft were best placed to introduce technical measures to stop children accessing porn sites.\"When access is controlled at the device level, it is efficient, it's effective, it's privacy-preserving,\" Friedman said.",

    "body": "Sweden is moving forward with plans to lower the age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 13 in serious cases as it grapples with a growing number of children recruited into gangs to carry out violent crimes without facing serious legal repercussions.Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said the country was in an \"emergency situation\" and stopping the use of children in criminal networks was a \"crucial task\" for the government.But several authorities, including police, prison officials and prosecutors, have opposed the plan, with some worried that it may lead to even younger children becoming offenders.If passed, the legislation will go into force as early as this summer.Strommer insisted that the proposal did not amount to a \"general lowering of the age of criminal responsibility\" and would only apply to the \"most serious crimes\" such as murder, attempted murder, aggravated bombings, aggravated weapons offences and aggravated rape.Under the proposal, some of these offenders could face prison sentences in certain cases.Data from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention shows that the number of registered offences linked to suspects under the age of 15 has doubled over the past decade.The current government came into power in 2022 vowing to crack down on organised crime.At the beginning of last year, a government-ordered inquiry recommended lowering the age of criminal responsibility to 14 in serious cases.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson confirmed in September that it would be lowered from 15, saying children are \"being ruthlessly exploited by criminal networks to commit serious crimes\".\"Both to protect these children and their potential victims, the government is taking strong action against this type of cynical exploitation,\" he added.The government then announced that it would seek to lower it to 13, and sent out the bill for input from 126 authorities and organisations.Their plans were met with criticism and opposition from different authorities and organisations.In November, the police authority said that the change risked \"significantly younger children\" getting involved in criminal gangs as a result.Other groups said the prison system was not equipped to handle such young offenders and detaining them could breach children's rights.The prison and probation service also said the move could lead to negative consequences for children and that they should be cared for in \"other ways\".Ministers had also previously considered imposing age limits on social media, with police arguing that gangs had used certain platforms to recruit young children into crime.Strommer said on Monday that he had taken note of the previous criticism of the bill, but that the situation had become more urgent.However opposition has not abated. Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained \"no factual arguments\", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT.He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year.Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect.The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.",

    "body": "3 hours agoTarah Welsh,Housing correspondentandJennifer ClarkeGetty ImagesThe government has set out more details of its planned shake-up of the leasehold system in England and Wales. The draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill includes plans to cap ground rent at £250, ban the sale of new leasehold flats and give homeowners greater control over how their buildings are managed.What is leasehold?There are around five million leasehold properties in England and Wales, of which 70% are flats.At the moment, the freeholder of a property generally owns the building and the land beneath it, outright and forever. Leaseholders effectively buy the right to live in the property for a fixed period of time.Leasehold flats are found in all sorts of properties - from converted Victorian houses to purpose built skyscrapers - and tend to be concentrated in big cities.Scotland and Northern Ireland have different systems of property ownership.What is ground rent and how are the rules changing?Ground rent is the fee paid by leasehold homeowners for the land beneath their buildings. It must be paid under the terms of their lease, and the amount due can double or increase in line with inflation at fixed intervals, which can make it difficult to sell or get a mortgage for a property.Ground rents were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remained for existing leasehold homes.The government says approximately 3.8 million properties still attract ground rent across England and Wales, with homeowners collectively paying more than £600m in 2025. The English Housing Survey estimates the average annual ground rent in 2023/2024 was £304. As part of the government's reforms, ground rent will be capped at £250, before falling to a \"peppercorn\" rate - effectively zero - after 40 years.The bill will now be scrutinised by MPs on the Housing Committee before making its way through Parliament, with the cap potentially coming into force in late 2028.What is commonhold and will leaseholds be banned?Campaigners have long argued that England and Wales's system of flat ownership is unfair, with leaseholders having little control over property costs.Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\".Under the bill, leasehold will be banned \"except in limited cases\", and developers will no longer be allowed to sell new flats as leasehold.Instead, new flats will be sold as commonhold - where neighbours collectively own the ground their flats are built on as well as the building itself. The commonhold model is widely used across the world. Long-term campaigner Sebastian O'Kelly from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership charity welcomed the bill: \"This is a transformative bit of legislation that will turn leaseholders into proper flat owners, as is already the case in the rest of the world.\"However, it is not yet clear how existing leasehold properties will transition to the commonhold model.  A government consultation on commonhold closes on 24 April.What are service charges and how are the rules changing?Leaseholders pay annual service charges to cover the cost of maintenance and repairs. The BBC has been contacted by hundreds of people who say their charges have spiralled in recent years. The former Conservative government had already said it would make service charges more transparent in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024, which took effect just before the last general election. The current Labour government says its reforms will build on those changes to make service charge bills clearer and help people challenge unfair costs.It also says the move to commonhold will give existing home owners unlimited control over their properties. The government has also said it will scrap something called \"forfeiture\". This process allows freeholders to start court action to seize someone's property if they have a service charge debt of more than £350. It's rare, but it does happen.This will be replaced by a new court-led process \"with strict safeguards for more extreme cases\".The government is also consulting on how to tackle the issue of charges levied on homeowners who have property on private estates.How have freeholders reacted to the government's plans?Many freeholders have reacted angrily.The Residential Freehold Association (RFA) unsuccessfully tried to challenge the previous government's leasehold reforms in the High Court.It criticised the ground rent cap as a \"wholly unjustified interference with existing property rights\". It says it will mean many professional freeholders will leave the sector, \"hinder[ing] building safety projects and disrupt[ing] the day-to-day lives of residents\".It called on the government to focus on other aspects of housing reform, \"such as regulating managing agents, improving transparency and raising professional standards\".",

    "body": "12 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorBoth of Westminster's mega brands, Labour and the Conservatives, feel discombobulated and the discombobulator-in-chief is the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage.The thing that ties together the big political stories of the last few days – the stymied manoeuvring of the Greater Manchester Mayor, Andy Burnham, and the shimmying of Suella Braverman out of one party and into another – is the capacity of Reform to give their rivals the heebie-jeebies.Labour are experiencing an anxiety dream, bordering on cold panic, about the possibility of losing the next general election to Reform.It is Labour's anxieties about this very prospect which add rocket fuel to the drama surrounding Andy Burnham. Labour fretting about Reform's rise is what turbo-charges questions about Sir Keir Starmer's future as prime minister and so raises the profile of those seen by some as possible successors.Meanwhile, the Conservatives are witnessing something of an exodus in Reform's direction. It is now four significant defectors just this month.While anyone drawing up a list of potential Conservative defectors to Reform would have put Braverman near the top, this was still a big moment.She is a former Conservative home secretary, a big beast of recent Tory history.And her switch emphasises the momentum Reform are showing in draining the Conservative Party and in particular its Right: a fortnight ago it was former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, the week before last it was Robert Jenrick, a week ago it was Andrew Rosindell, now it is Suella Braverman.On stage at her defection, Braverman shared Reform's diagnosis that Britain is broken, a label the Conservatives disagree with. And like Jenrick before her, she offered a devastating critique of her former party's recent governing record.And all this at just the point Kemi Badenoch has been attracting warmer reviews from her colleagues.Meanwhile, within the Tory fold but outside the Commons, a new group called Prosper UK has launched.Some prominent names in the mix include former Home Secretary Amber Rudd and former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson.These are Conservatives you would least expect to join Reform. Plenty of its supporters backed Remain, many but not all are roughly on the Left of the Conservative tradition. And they are arguing it is time for their voices to be heard once again. Where does this leave Badenoch as a figure of the Right?In short, both the Conservatives and Labour are contorted and strained right now.And let's not forget the questions too for Nigel Farage – not least the recurring one, about whether he leads a convention of cheesed off Conservatives.And whether, even with all the current noise and momentum, Reform really can build a viable prospective alternative government within just a few years.Doing so, Farage insists, has to involve recruiting people with experience of government, like Braverman.But to Reform's critics it dents their claim to run a fresh insurgency untainted by the failures of governments past.",

    "body": "A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China.The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency.Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out.Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China.\"A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves,\" Zhang said.\"This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people,\" she added.\"People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work.\"Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports.One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: \"This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work.\"With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness.\"The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase \"money comes quickly\" embroidered on its body in golden letters.Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but \"it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days\".She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work \"being immediately happy\".\"But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites,\" she said.Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

It is closely followed by vampire-horror Sinners, which has 13, Shakespeare drama Hamnet and table-tennis biopic Marty Supreme, which have 11 each.Timothée Chalamet and Jessie Buckley, considered the Oscar frontrunners in the lead acting categories, repeat their nominations at the Baftas.Other stars to be recognised include two actors who were notably absent from the Oscar nominations - Chase Infiniti and Paul Mescal.That could be partly because the Baftas have more slots available - many categories have six spots compared with the five at the Oscars.Getty ImagesPaul Mescal and Jessie Buckley are both recognised for their performances in HamnetThe Baftas also have additional categories dedicated to recognising UK talent - outstanding British film and outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer.I Swear, Pillion, H is for Hawk and The Ballad of Wallis Island are among the British films which are recognised in Bafta's shortlists.\"It is thrilling to see British indie films and debuts in the company of blockbusters that have taken the world by storm,\" said Bafta chair Sara Putt.\"We hope the public enjoy watching these films as much as our 8,300 BAFTA film voters have.\"The Bafta nominations in fullBafta nominations: As it happenedAlthough several films have performed well with Bafta, none has equalled the Bafta record of 16 nominations that was achieved by 1982's Gandhi.Actor and TV presenter Alan Cumming will host the Bafta Film Awards at London's Royal Festival Hall on Sunday 22 February.Getty ImagesSinners director Ryan Coogler (centre) and stars Wunmi Mosaku and Michael B Jordan are all nominatedThere are four actors who were nominated at the Oscars who have missed out at the Baftas.They are Amy Madigan (Weapons), Delroy Lindo (Sinners), Wagner Moura (The Secret Agent) and Elle Fanning (Sentimental Value) - the latter two had not even been longlisted by Bafta.In contrast, there are other actors who missed out at the Oscars but have been nominated at the Baftas, including Jesse Plemons (Bugonia) and Odessa A'Zion (Marty Supreme).There are also more British nominees in Bafta's acting categories, such as Robert Aramayo and Peter Mullan (I Swear), Carey Mulligan (The Ballad of Wallis Island) and Emily Watson (Hamnet), while Sinners star Wunmi Mosaku repeats her Oscar nomination.Wicked: For Good might have been shut out at the Oscars, but it manages two nominations at the Baftas, for costume design and make-up and hair.Brazilian thriller The Secret Agent has two nominations - half the number it received at the Oscars, where it got into major categories including best actor and best picture.Other nominees include Frankenstein, a new take on the famous story about a mad professor and the creature he creates, and Sentimental Value, an emotive family drama about two daughters who reconnect with their estranged father.The director category, meanwhile, features the same five nominees as the Oscars, but the additional slot available at Bafta means that Yorgos Lanthimos also makes it in for conspiracy theory drama Bugonia.Getty ImagesTimothée Chalamet is nominated alongside his Marty Supreme co-star Odessa A'zionBrad Pitt's racing drama F1 received three Bafta nominations in technical categories, but failed to repeat its surprise inclusion in the best picture category at the Oscars.Perhaps the most notable omission is KPop Demon Hunters - the Netflix smash that was the biggest viral film hit of last year.It was ineligible for the Bafta longlists as it opened straight to Netflix in the UK without a preceding theatrical run (although a singalong version was released in cinemas later).",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRoberto Schmidt/GettyThe images emanating from Minneapolis have shocked ItaliansThe US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in two fatal shootings in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.Confirmation of the agency's role came from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.\"This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,\" the city's mayor, Beppe Sala, told Italian radio on Tuesday.An ICE spokesperson stressed that \"all security operations remain under Italian authority\".US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if the customs and enforcement agency had itself taken part.The agency's statement on Tuesday explained that \"ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations\".It would \"obviously\" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, it said.Piero CRUCIATTI/AFPItalian troops in Milan - the Winter Olympics at Milan-Cortina take place from 6-22 FebruaryItaly's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: \"I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.\"But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets.In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide \"yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump\".The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that \"ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory\". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.\"I believe [ICE agents]shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security,\" Beppe Sala told RTL radio.",

    "body": "Icon, trailblazer & Wales hero - Fishlock's seismic legacyImage source, FAWImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock is the most capped Wales international of all timeByIan MitchelmoreBBC Sport WalesJess Fishlock's Wales chapter is poised to come to an end following a glorious international career that has boasted 165 caps and 48 goals.She will make her 166th and final appearance for her country when Rhian Wilkinson's side host Australia at Cardiff City Stadium on 25 October.The 38-year-old Fishlock was a monumental figure in the growth of a side that played in a major tournament for the first time in their history earlier in 2025.The record goalscorer then netted the first ever goal for the women's side on the grandest stage, although her remarkable impact went way beyond her on-pitch exploits.Destined for greatnessFrom the word go, there was always something special about Fishlock.She started her playing career with hometown club Cardiff City Ladies, now Gwalia United, and swiftly caught the eye - making her first-team debut at 15.Having captained Wales Under-19s, Fishlock earned her senior bow against Switzerland - a nation where almost two decades later the final touch of gloss would be dabbed on what was to be a glittering career - in 2006.Only two years later, Fishlock made the decision to join Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and became the first overseas player in the Eredivisie.Her boldness typified that of a woman who was as relentless as she was ambitious from the very beginning of her time as a footballer.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Midfielder Jess Fishlock scored her 48th Wales goal at Euro 2025Despite some struggles in the Netherlands, Fishlock was part of a side that claimed back-to-back Eredivisie titles, and it was a sign of things to come at club level. Upon returning to Bristol, she was named Women's Super League (WSL) Players' Player of the Season in her second campaign and enjoyed even more success in Australia soon after.Having joined Melbourne Victory, Fishlock starred as the Victoria-based side reached two Grand Finals - winning their first title in 2013.An eye-catching move to Seattle Reign in 2013 proved to be the catalyst in making Fishlock a star on the global stage.She has helped the club win three NWSL Shield titles, and even during her loan stints away from the American side, of which there have been six in total, success still followed.Indeed, the midfielder tasted further league glory with Glasgow, Melbourne City, Frankfurt and Lyon - winning the Champions League with each of the latter two sides.But the glut of honours were never replicated on the international stage.Fishlock wasted no time in becoming a key cog under Andy Beattie, Adrian Tucker, Jarmo Matikainen, Jayne Ludlow, Gemma Grainger and most recently Wilkinson.Though for all of her mesmerising showings, goals, assists and endeavour, tournament qualification proved one hurdle too many with Wales for the majority of her career. Although, thankfully, not for all of it.Media caption, 'She's the best player in the world'Finally achieving a dreamThe date 3 December 2024 will be forever etched into Wales history.Following a 1-1 draw between the sides in Cardiff four days earlier, goals from Hannah Cain and Carrie Jones earned Rhian Wilkinson's side a 2-1 victory over the Republic of Ireland in Dublin to ensure Wales would at long last break their tournament duck.It was the pinnacle for a team who had seen icons including Laura McAllister, Jayne Ludlow and Helen Ward - and Neville Southall, Ryan Giggs, Ian Rush and Mark Hughes to name a few on the men's side - all fail to achieve their tournament dream with Wales.On the eve of the 2025 Euros, Fishlock told BBC Sport Wales: \"A big narrative around my entire career internationally has been, 'Can I get to a major tournament?' and 'Can we get to a major tournament?' We've been so close so many times.\"When you want to achieve something and you get to do it with some of your very closest friends, there's really no comparison to that feeling.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jess Fishlock netted for Wales in a 4-1 loss to France at Euro 2025Even in the aftermath of their humbling 3-0 defeat by the Netherlands in their competition opener in Switzerland, Fishlock was intent on ensuring further progress was the target.\"This is the level now, right?\" she said. \"We've got to get used to this real fast.\"Not content with adding one more piece of history to her ever-increasing list of achievements, Fishlock again took centre stage as she netted a 13th-minute equaliser in Wales' second group stage match against France in St Gallen - the first  goal the women's side had scored in a major tournament.Aged 38 years and 176 days, the strike made Fishlock the oldest scorer in women's Euro finals history.It was as fitting as it was deserved, given the weight of expectation she had carried on her shoulders for the vast majority of her time in the red of Wales. It also demonstrated there was immense quality to go with her commendable longevity - with Fishlock playing in 67% of the 245 international matches ever played by the Welsh women's side.Recent Welsh success has brought with it increased expectation and stronger opposition - with Wales' nine-game winless run across their Euro and Nations League A fixtures in 2025 serving as proof that they are now on a whole new level when it comes to competing with the world's big guns.But Fishlock simply would not have it any other way.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, USA star Megan Rapinoe (L) and Wales great Jess Fishlock made a point to support LGBT rights after a friendly matchFishlock has never shied away from using her profile to speak out on her beliefs having come out as gay.In 2018, Fishlock - who married former team-mate Tziarra King in 2023 - was awarded an MBE for services to women's football and the LGBT community.Before the men's World Cup in Qatar, Fishlock opened up on the importance of visibility amid concerns over the 2022 tournament host nation's record on gay rights.It came after she had described her experience at school as \"hell on earth\" because of abuse she received over her sexuality.Nevertheless, Fishlock remained determined to use her platform to help educate others.Speaking in 2019, Fishlock said: \"I'm not the only one that gets abused. I am not the only one that gets comments thrown at them. \"It's come round to my family and my sisters and my mum and my dad, so when I made that decision, you know I have to think about other people as well otherwise it's very selfish of me.\"But there really is a big picture, and the bigger picture is generations of kids looking at a role model, looking at what they've achieved and understanding whatever they are going through.\"Following the friendly between Wales and the United States of America in July 2023, Fishlock embraced USA icon and Seattle Reign team-mate Megan Rapinoe - who is also openly gay.The pair wore each other's national team shirt and posed for photographs - making sure their support for LGBT rights was front and centre of the pictures' message.Such has been Fishlock's impact on the game itself, a mural covering the playing area of a five-a-side football pitch in Splott, Cardiff, was unveiled in June to celebrate her impact on football, equality and representation.The Red Wall will get the chance to celebrate Fishlock's efforts when Wales host Australia and Poland in friendlies later this month.One thing is for certain, the void left by Fishlock is unlikely ever to be filled, or her achievements surpassed.But Wales are unquestionably in a far better place thanks to the truly astonishing efforts of a player who gave her all, and more, to ensure she leaves behind a legacy like no other.",

It then headed back east, having dropped to an altitude of 10,000 feet, accoring to FlightRadar24.At this time, the plane started broadcasting a \"7700 squawk code\" on its transponder. These are relayed to signify a general emergency onboard, ranging from engine failure to depressurisation to a medical emergency.In February a government plane carrying Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to turn back due to a crack in the window of the cockpit, as well.Defence ministers had gathered in Belgium on Wednesday to discuss security in Ukraine.

Robert Bush, 47, admitted 35 offences of fraud by false representation and another of fraudulently running a business, Hull-based Legacy Independent Funeral Directors relating to the sale of funeral plans.He also denied 30 counts of preventing lawful and decent burials and one charge of stealing money from charity collection boxes, during a hearing at Hull Crown Court.Bush, formerly of Kirk Ella, East Yorkshire and now living in West Yorkshire, will face a trial at Sheffield Crown Court on 5 October 2026.Humberside Police began its inquiry into Legacy Independent Funeral Directors following a report of \"concern for care of the deceased\" in March 2024.The force said four of the fraud by false representation counts related to \"ashes provided to families following loss in pregnancy\".It took the court clerk 22 minutes to put all 67 charges to Bush, who wore a grey three-piece suit, a white shirt and purple tie.There were gasps from the packed public gallery each time a not guilty plea was entered.A woman heckled Bush from the gallery as he was ushered out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing.

    "body": "7 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterWatch: Trump says Modi \"assured\" him India would no longer buy Russian oilPresident Donald Trump has said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to stop buying Russian oil, as the US seeks to put economic pressure on the Kremlin as part of efforts to end the war in Ukraine.Trump told reporters he had received assurances from Modi that India would halt its purchases \"within a short period of time\", which he called \"a big stop\". A spokeswoman for the Indian embassy in Washington DC would not comment. The US president has sought to leverage India's purchases of Russian oil in his trade war, but Delhi has resisted, creating a diplomatic rift. Oil and gas are Russia's biggest exports, and Moscow's biggest customers include China, India and Turkey.\"Now I've got to get China to do the same thing,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday. His administration is also pushing Beijing, and other trading partners, to stop buying oil from Russia, part of a broader push to cut off Moscow's energy funding.India cannot \"immediately\" halt oil shipments, Trump said, adding that the shift will be \"a little bit of a process, but the process is going to be over with soon\".The Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India, levies that Trump has characterised as punishment against Delhi for buying Russian oil and weapons. The tariffs – which took effect in August and are among the highest in the world – include a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for its war in Ukraine.Modi has for months stood his ground, arguing that India is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war despite his country's ties with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. ReutersTrump and Modi - pictured in February - have been at loggerheads on trade Indian officials have called the Trump administration's accusations that Delhi profits from Russia's war in Ukraine a double standard, citing ongoing trade with Russia in the US and Europe.India relies on Russian crude oil, which Delhi has continued to buy at a discount, to support its economy - the fifth largest in the world.The dispute over Russian oil has strained the relationship between Trump and Modi, although the US president on Wednesday praised the Indian leader as a \"great man\". Modi said last week that he spoke with Trump and that they \"reviewed good progress achieved in trade negotiations\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeBusiness reporterThe chancellor should be \"bold\" in next month's Budget or risk future spending cuts and tax rises, an influential think tank has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is projecting Rachel Reeves will need to find £22bn to make up a shortfall in the government's finances, and will \"almost certainly\" have to raise taxes. Finding this amount would allow the government to maintain the £10bn of headroom it has built into the system - but the IFS says there is a \"strong case\" for trying to increase it beyond this amount. IFS director Helen Miller said the lack of a bigger buffer brought with it instability, and could leave the chancellor \"limping from one forecast to the next\".  \"A key challenge is ensuring that fiscal groundhog day doesn't become a twice-yearly ritual,\" Ms Miller said. She said the position the chancellor finds herself in was \"to a large extent, a situation of her own making\".\"When choosing to operate her fiscal rules with such teeny tiny headroom, Ms Reeves would have known that run-of-the-mill forecast changes could easily blow her off course,\" Ms Miller added.The think tank pointed to rising borrowing costs, weaker growth forecasts and spending commitments made since the spring as reasons for the government's tight position. It said Reeves needs to make up that shortfall so she can meet her own fiscal rules, which she has called \"non-negotiable\". The two main rules are:Not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending by the end of this parliamentTo get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliamentMs Miller added that the \"constant obsession with the headroom\" was a distraction from important debates on how policy could bolster economic growth and the reform of the tax system. Speaking on Wednesday, Reeves gave the strongest indication to date that she is planning to raise taxes in the Budget. The IFS's green budget looks ahead to some of the decisions the government will have to make in its 26 November Budget. The report is funded by the Nuffield Foundation and produced in association with Barclays.In a chapter of its report published last week, the IFS urged said Reeves could raise tens of billions of pounds a year more in revenue without breaking manifesto promises, but this would not be straightforward.During last year's election, Labour said they \"will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT\" - which the IFS flags as the simplest ways to raise revenue.

    "body": "12 hours agoDavid GrittenBBCIt is difficult to identify bodies with just codes and numbers attached to the bags, Palestinian officials sayA health official in Gaza says a specialist committee is working to identify the bodies of 90 Palestinians handed over by Israel in exchange for dead hostages held by Hamas.If they were unsuccessful, photos would be posted online so families could search for relatives, said Dr Mohammed Zaqout, director general of hospitals for the Hamas-run health ministry.It is not clear whether the bodies - stored at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis - belong to Palestinians who died in Gaza or in Israeli custody. Footage filmed by a freelance journalist working for the BBC at Nasser's mortuary appeared to show the body of a blindfolded man. Another body seemed to have marks around the wrists and ankles.The BBC has asked the Israeli military and justice ministry for comment. They have previously rejected accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees.Under last week's ceasefire agreement with Hamas, Israel has agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.So far, the Israeli military has said the remains of six Israeli hostages have been returned.The body of another hostage - a Nepalese national - has also been returned from Gaza, along with the remains of another person who was not a hostage.Israel has called on Hamas to \"make all necessary efforts\" to recover the bodies of the remaining 21 deceased hostages as agreed.The last 20 living hostages were also handed over by Hamas on Monday in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Latest updatesHostage families confirm identities of three of four bodies handed over by HamasTrump demands Hamas disarm, as group moves against 'collaborators' in GazaBowen: Trump's role in Gaza ceasefire was decisive, but not a roadmap to peaceIsraeli authorities handed over 45 Palestinians' bodies to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on Monday - with another 45 on Wednesday. The remains were transferred by the ICRC to Nasser hospital.Speaking outside the facility on Tuesday, Dr Zaqout said the first group of bodies had been kept by Israeli authorities in refrigerators, and that \"some are clearly recognisable, while others are difficult to identify\".\"Once confirmed, we will publish the names for the families so they can come forward to identify and bury their loved ones.\"However, Dr Zaqout said health officials had so far received no information to assist them, such as names or the circumstances of death.\"What we received are bodies with codes and numbers. However, we were promised that... we would be provided with the names. We are awaiting further clarification from our colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross.\"If we receive the names from [Israel], we will publish them. If not, we will be forced to create a link where photos of the identifiable martyrs will be posted.\"Gaza's health system has been devastated by the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, and lacks the specialist equipment needed for the identification of bodies, such as DNA testing.Rasmieh Qdeih said she was searching for her son, Fadi, who has been missing since the start of the warAlso outside Nasser hospital was Rasmieh Qdeih from Khuzaa, a town east of Khan Younis.She was searching for her son Fadi, 36, who has been missing since 7 October 2023, when the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.At least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.\"I don't know whether he was imprisoned or martyred. I contacted everyone; no-one told me anything,\" Ms Qdeih said.\"Every time a prisoner is released, I ask them - have you seen Fadi?... Is he a prisoner, a martyr, or missing? They say 'no'. Everyone in Negev prison says they haven't heard that name. Each one tells me something different.\"She said the wait to learn her son's fate was the most difficult she had ever experienced.\"I'm not upset... I just want to know if my son is among them. If not, if they don't find my son among these martyrs, I will be shocked.\"\"If there's anything, I'll recognise him - my son's leg is amputated, and he has vitiligo... His hair is white. I'd know him,\" she added.It is not clear how many bodies of Palestinians from Gaza are being held by Israel.The National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs' Bodies, a non-governmental Palestinian campaign group, said last week the remains of at least 735 people, 99 of them from Gaza, were being held by Israel in its mortuaries or cemeteries.It also cited Israeli media reports from last year as saying Israel was holding the bodies of approximately 1,500 Hamas fighters at the Sde Teiman military base.",

    "body": "A University of Oxford student filmed allegedly chanting for Gaza to \"put the Zios in the ground\" at a pro-Palestinian march has been arrested.Officers investigating chants at a Palestine Coalition demonstration in central London on Saturday arrested a 20-year-old-man on suspicion of inciting racial hatred, the Metropolitan Police said. Videos appeared to show a man, who has been widely named as Samuel Williams, telling demonstrators that the chant had been \"workshopped\" in Oxford.The University of Oxford said a student had been arrested in the early hours of Wednesday, but said it had not been told why. It is understood the student has been suspended by the university. The man was arrested at an address in Oxford, police said, and remains in custody. The force did not name the man. In videos he appears to tell the crowd: \"A steadfast and noble resistance in Palestine and in Gaza to look to, to be inspired by and - I don't want to yap for too long - but a chant that we've been workshopping in Oxford that maybe you guys want to join in.\"It goes 'Gaza, Gaza make us proud, put the Zios in the ground'.\"A university spokesperson said: \"An Oxford University student was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday, 15 October.\"The precise basis for the arrest has not yet been disclosed to the university.\"While the university cannot comment on individual student cases, it has the power to take immediate and proportionate action including, as appropriate, suspending a student from membership of the University, whenever serious concerns are raised.\"Oxford University is unequivocal: there is no place for hatred, antisemitism or discrimination within our community, and we will always act to protect the safety and dignity of our students.\"Last week, the prime minister said the government could consider pursuing more curbs on protest laws, including targeting some of the chants used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",

    "body": "8 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal Correspondent, at Westminster Magistrates' CourtReutersProtesters in London's Trafalgar Square on 4 October for a demonstration against the ban on Palestine ActionTwenty-eight people have pleaded not guilty after being charged under anti-terrorism laws with allegedly supporting the banned group Palestine Action. In the first of a series of complex hearings on Wednesday, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard about 2,000 people are likely to be charged with showing support in demonstrations for the group proscribed as a terrorist organisation in July.Judges face trying to find time and courtrooms to hold 400 trials of those accused of taking part in protests.While the judge began setting provisional trial dates for March, there is no certainty they can take place before the end of 2026 because of the ongoing legal battle over the group's proscription.The government proscribed Palestine Action under anti-terrorism legislation in July, after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged two military aircraft earlier in the year.Since that ban more than 2,100 people have been arrested at demonstrations in England and Wales. Each of them has been accused of holding up a placard reading: \"I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action\".So far, some 170 of them - many of them pensioners - have been charged with displaying an item supportive of a banned organisation. This is a low-level terrorism offence which can be dealt with in a magistrates' court and can lead to six months in jail.The first of two days of dedicated hearings to manage the cases dominated Westminster Magistrates' Court, as district judge Michael Snow set out how the courts would deal with all of them.Most of the 28 defendants appearing, who were among those arrested at the first protests in July, did not have a lawyer. That meant many were often unclear about what was going on or had not had an opportunity to read the basics of the accusations they face.Many complained to the court that their prosecution was unjust.Anthony Harvey, 59, travelled from his home in Oban, in the Scottish Highlands, to deny supporting a proscribed organisation.He told the judge: \"Protesting against genocide is not terrorism, I'm not guilty.\"The oldest defendant was 83-year-old the Reverend Susan Parfitt, from Bristol, who is partially deaf.She gently held onto a hand rail in the courtroom as Judge Snow came down from the bench to sit next to her, so she could hear him.When he asked her for her plea, she replied: \"I was objecting against the proscription of Palestine Action and I therefore plead not guilty.\"David Kilroy, 66, from Plymouth, wearing a Just Stop Oil t-shirt, told the court: \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes a duty. Not guilty.\"During the day, prosecutor Peter Ratliff told the court that there were difficulties in fixing firm trial dates from early next year for what could end up being 2,000 defendants because of the ongoing legal challenge to the banning of Palestine Action.If that challenge overturns the ban, the prosecutions would almost certainly be scrapped. But if the ban remains there could still be complex questions over how the suspects can defend themselves.Three lead cases, which came to court in September, are being prioritised to try to decide those questions - but any of these legal standoffs could end up before the Supreme Court.If that happened, trials would have to be delayed, perhaps into 2027.Judge Snow acknowledged the risk of having to revise plans for 2,000 defendants if the Supreme Court ultimately gets involved in the case – but he said he had to nevertheless set timetables. Courtrooms at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London are being set aside to manage the cases.That plan involves at least two trials a day of a total of 10 defendants, starting from 23 March. If the 2,000 defendant figure is correct, that would require at least 400 trials - or 200 full days of court time.But on Wednesday defendants and a lawyer told the judge there was a risk the trials would be too short to be fair.Katie McFadden, acting for some of the defendants, said that a half-day trial of five defendants at a time raised questions about whether that was enough time for them to individually give evidence, present their free speech arguments and be cross-examined.Another suspect, 72-year-old Deborah Wilde, told the court: \"I don't think I can get a fair trial on the [time] limit that you have allocated to me. I would like to seek leave to appeal.\"Judge Snow told her that was not legally possible.\"I'm satisfied that the time is sufficient,\" he said. \"I'm not allowing more time for the trial. Your only remedy is the High Court.\"Another 30 defendants are due in court on Thursday to continue allocating trial dates. On Friday, the Court of Appeal will rule on a government attempt to stop the challenge to Palestine Action's ban. Separately in November, the first trial is due to begin of alleged Palestine Action members who are accused of offences, including violence, relating to the targeting of an Israeli defence firm.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump wants to build a triumphal arch across from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, the latest in his efforts to make over the capital city in his style.The so-called Arc de Trump would commemorate the country's 250th anniversary next year and is reportedly being privately funded by Trump's supporters.A real estate developer by trade, Trump teased plans last week with renderings for the structure being laid out during an Oval Office meeting.His other second-term developments include a gilded makeover for the White House, paving over the Rose Garden and constructing a $250m ballroom, as well as the clearing of homeless encampments throughout the capital.It's not unusual for a sitting president or first lady to update the White House, but Trump appears to have his sights set on a farther reaching and widely seen development with the new monument.The president wants the arch to be based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, and to welcome people into the nation's capital from Arlington National Cemetery as they cross the Memorial Bridge.\"Every time somebody rides over that beautiful bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, they literally say something is supposed be here. We have versions of it… This is a mock-up,\" Trump told donors on Wednesday night, referring to a grassy, circular area at the end of the bridge.At a dinner to unveil his plans for the ballroom, Trump said there were three version of the arch - small, medium and large - but that he liked the largest one the best. Trump said the ballroom project was \"fully financed\" and some of the leftover money would be used to fund the arch. It's not yet clear when construction will begin or how much it will cost. Last week, Trump displayed renderings for the structure on the Resolute Desk showing a map of the Memorial Bridge that also included a replica of the Lincoln Memorial. A model of his proposed archway stood on the Virginia state side of the Potomac River.On Saturday, Trump posted an illustration of a plan designed by Harrison Design architect Nicolas Leo Charbonneau on Truth Social. Charbonneau, a partner at Harrison Design, posted a watercolour rendering of the the proposal on social media on 4 September, writing \"America needs a triumphal arch!\" According to Axios, Trump has had models and dioramas built for other projects he is considering and has directed how and where new marble-tiled floors would be laid in the White House. He has also taken world leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and a delegation of Florida lawmakers on tours of the White House to show them his changes, some of which mirror the aesthetic of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.He unveiled a \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" along the West Wing colonnade in September, displaying gold-framed portraits of himself and the 44 other presidents along the white exterior wall. In place of former President Joe Bide'sn headshot, Trump instead hung a photo of an autopen signing his name. The move appeared to refer to Trump's claim that Biden's use of the autopen signalled his decline at the end of his presidency, although it is common for US presidents to use such a tool.  Critics, including a guest essayist for the New York Times, have called his Oval Office remodel a \"Gilded Rococo Nightmare\".The White House did not immediately respond on Wednesday to the BBC's request for further comment.",

    "body": "An Israeli couple who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks have been reunited, two years after they were violently split up.Noa Argamani and Avinatan Or were seized at the Nova music festival. Video of Ms Argamani being dragged away in terror on the back of a motorbike became one of the most widely recognised images of the attacks.She was rescued by Israeli commandos on 8 June 2024. Mr Or, who was held separately in central Gaza, was released on Monday - one of 20 living hostages to be returned as part of the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.In a post on Instagram, Ms Argamani said the couple could now begin \"healing together\".After reuniting, Israeli media said the pair shared their \"first cigarette together after two years\".A day after her partner's release, Ms Argamani shared an emotional Instagram post alongside their first photos together since 2023.\"Two years since the last moment I saw Avinatan, my love. Two years since terrorists kidnapped us, put me on a motorcycle, and tore us apart in front of the whole world,\" she wrote.She said she had been held with other women and children inside houses during her captivity, \"while Avinatan was only in the tunnels\". \"Hamas released videos and signs of life from me, while there was no information at all about Avinatan,\" the post, in Hebrew, continued.She said the pair could now begin their recovery. \"We won our personal war and the whole world's fight with us to get to this moment, and now it's time for us to begin our shared journey together,\" the post said.Ms Argamani also thanked Trump for his part in bringing the hostages home and helping them \"overcome the darkness\".Mr Or's father told Israeli media about the conditions his son had been kept in - food supplies which were \"meagre\" and a lot of time alone, chained up in tunnels and small enclosures during his 738 days in captivity.He said his son - who is around 2m (6ft 5in) tall - was held at one point in a space just 1.8m high, and just slightly longer than the mattress he slept on.\"He's extremely thin,\" Yaron Or told reporters, adding that his son had had \"no books, no human contact - nothing\", but was given a Rubik's Cube at one point.He was given very little information about the outside world, including the whereabouts of his girlfriend or the full scope of the Hamas attacks and subsequent Israeli offensive.\"Around him were guards whose relatives had been killed in IDF [Israel Defense Forces] strikes, I think it's simply a miracle they didn't harm him, except for one time he tried to escape,\" the senior Mr Or said.Avinatan Or reportedly tried to escape whilst being moved through a tunnel but was captured and beaten for the attempt. \"He's sharing things gradually, we're not asking directly,\" his father said.\"Physically, he still needs to recover,\" he continued. \"But mentally, thank God, he's the same Avinatan - same humour, same strength.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoSean SeddonBBC News andKate WhannelBBC NewsAFP/Getty ImagesChristopher Cash (left) and Christopher Berry (right) were both accused of spying for ChinaThe government's deputy national security adviser warned in 2023 China was carrying out \"large scale espionage\" activities against the UK when asked to provide evidence in the now-collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China.A second witness statement written by Matthew Collins in February 2025 as evidence for the case of two men, Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, said China's spying threatened \"the UK's economic prosperity and resilience\". A third witness statement published in August this year restated the UK's view of the challenge posed by China.But the second two statements made clear the government was \"committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China\". Both Mr Cash and Mr Berry have denied the allegations against them.All three statements by Mr Collins were published by Downing Street on Wednesday night as the government continued to face questions after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) unexpectedly dropped charges against the two men last month, prompting criticism from ministers and MPs. The first of these three statements was given to prosecutors in December 2023, when he was serving under a Conservative government.The second and third statements were submitted this year after Labour had taken power.Previously, the director of public prosecutions said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.Earlier on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said he would publish the deputy national security adviser's statements after Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of a \"cover-up\".The documents show that in December 2023, Mr Collins concluded: \"The Chinese Intelligence Services are highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operations against the UK and other international partners to advance the Chinese state's interest and harm the interests and security of the UK.\"In February 2025, he said: \"China is an authoritarian state, with different values to the UK. This presents challenges for both the UK and our allies. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also present the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security.\" And in a third statement this August, he said China's \"espionage operations threaten the UK's economic prosperity and resilience, and the integrity of our democratic institutions\".He pointed to a number of actions which UK authorities believe Beijing was behind, including a cyber-attack on the UK electoral commission between 2021 and 2023.In his 2025 statements, Mr Collins made clear the government sought a good economic relationship with China, writing: \"It is important for me to emphasise, however that the government is committed to pursuing a positive economic relationship with China.\"The government believes that the UK must continue to engage with international partners on trade and investment to grow our economy while ensuring that our security and values are not compromised.\"When the second statement was signed by Mr Collins, it was dated in error as February 2024. But the government said it had actually been signed and submitted to prosecutors in February 2025, by which time Labour were in power, and this had been clarified to the CPS at the time.BBC News understands that Mr Collins assumed he had given enough evidence for the prosecution to continue when he submitted his third witness statement in August 2025.A government source pointed to comments made by him where he described \"the increasing Chinese espionage threat posed to the UK\" as an example of why he believed he had said enough to satisfy the CPS's threshold for prosecution.It is also understood that the CPS contacted Mr Collins after his first witness statement to ask for further clarification on the threat posed by China, but that they were not explicitly clear what the official would need to say in subsequent statements, in order to meet the CPS's threshold.New details of alleged spyingIn his first statement, Mr Collins wrote in detail about the allegations made about Mr Cash and Mr Berry he said were based on information provided to him by counter-terrorism police.Mr Collins said in this 2023 statement \"it had been assessed that the Chinese state recruited Mr Berry as an agent and successfully directed him to utilise Mr Cash\" who had access to the Commons China Research Group (CRG) and other MPs.Mr Cash worked as a parliamentary researcher and was involved with the CRG, which was set up by a group of Conservative MPs looking into how the UK should respond to the rise of China.In his statement, Mr Collins said that in July 2022, Mr Berry met with a senior Chinese Communist Party leader and that he understood Mr Cash was made aware of the meeting by Mr Berry.Mr Collins said Mr Cash responded to Mr Berry with multiple messages, including one reading: \"You're in spy territory now.\"Mr Collins also said information gathered was passed to an individual named \"Alex\" who was believed to be an agent of the Chinese state.He said in assessing whether this was prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, he had proceeded on the basis the facts, as alleged, by counter-terrorism police were true.This included information about the prospect of Tom Tugendhat MP being made a minister and the likelihood of Jeremy Hunt pulling out of the Conservative leadership race.In a new statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Cash said he wanted to reiterate that he was \"completely innocent\". He said: \"I have been placed in an impossible position. I have not had the daylight of a public trial to show my innocence, and I should not have to take part in a trial by media.\"The statements that have been made public are completely devoid of the context that would have been given at trial.\"While Mr Berry has previously denied spying for China, he has not commented since the day the case ended.House of CommonsSir Keir Starmer committed to urgently publishing the documents in the Commons on WednesdayMr Cash and Mr Berry were charged under the Official Secrets Act in April 2024, when the Conservatives were in power.They were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between December 2021 and February 2023.The director of public prosecutions has said the case collapsed because evidence could not be obtained from the government referring to China as a national security threat.He said while there was sufficient evidence when charges were originally brought against the two men, a precedent set by another spying case earlier this year meant China would need to have been labelled a \"threat to national security\" at the time of the alleged offences.The Conservatives have claimed the government did not provide sufficient evidence because it does not want to damage relations with Beijing.However, the Labour government has argued that because the alleged offences took place under the Conservatives, the prosecution could only be based on their stance on China at the time.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Sir Keir Starmer said: \"Under this government, no minister or special adviser played any role in the provision of evidence.\"The publication of the documents followed pressure from the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, who had called for them to be released.On Tuesday, senior government figures had suggested that the CPS had told them publishing the witness statements would be \"inappropriate\".But the CPS later made clear it would not stand in the way if ministers chose to put the government's evidence in the public domain.",

    "body": "Basketball's world governing body Fiba has suspended the British Basketball Federation (BBF) and barred the men's team from international competition because of governance issues.A Fiba taskforce was set up in August to investigate \"regulatory non-compliance\" within British basketball.In April, the BBF awarded a 15-year licence to run a new professional men's competition - the Great Britain Basketball League - to GBB League Ltd (GBBL).The BBF said GBBL, a consortium led by the American businessman Marshall Glickman, would provide £15m funding in the first two years. However, the existing nine Super League Basketball [SLB] clubs claimed the tender process run by the governing body was \"illegal and unjust\" and refused to join the new league.The clubs launched legal action against the BBF in the high court, while UK sports minister Stephanie Peacock reportedly asked the government body responsible for elite funding, UK Sport, to investigate the allegations.In a statement, Fiba said it had completed a \"comprehensive review of the situation, including interviews and meetings with basketball stakeholders\".Under the terms of the suspension, the BBF will not be permitted to licence or recognise national men's competitions, or field a men's national team in Fiba senior competitions.The taskforce will now \"engage directly with basketball stakeholders and the UK government to explore and propose an interim operational framework for the top-tier men's national competitions\".The statement added: \"These measures aim to restore regulatory integrity and promote sustainable governance of men's basketball in Great Britain as soon as possible.\"Sports minister Peacock said she was \"deeply concerned by the news\".\"While it is a relief that the GB women's team is not included in this suspension, work must clearly be done to fix the domestic game and ensure our teams can continue to compete on the world stage,\" the minister said. \"We will work closely with Fiba and other partners on the interim operational framework, using this as a moment to move forward as we start the process of addressing governance concerns and protecting the future of British basketball.\"On Sunday, the BBF announced the resignation of chairman Chris Grant after three years because of \"personal reasons\".Its interim chair Grace Jacca said in a statement on Wednesday: \"We understand the disappointment that players, staff and fans alike will be feeling. \"Our immediate priority is to continue working with our key stakeholders to maintain stability while contributing constructively to the process with Fiba.\"BBF added that the GB men's World Cup qualifier against Lithuania, which was scheduled to be held in London on 27 November, will not go ahead.

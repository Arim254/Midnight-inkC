    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Liverpool finished third in the Champions League table to go directly into the last 16ByFootball issues correspondentIt has been quite the season in the Champions League for Premier League clubs.All six teams are still in business in European football's elite club competition. Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City are guaranteed to be in the last 16 of the Champions League.And they could be joined by Newcastle, if they navigate a two-legged play-off against Monaco or Qarabag.England is the only country to have every team - nine of them - through to the knockout rounds across the three European competitions.  How is this success being viewed across Europe? Does it denigrate the new format? And why are Premier League clubs proving so powerful?'An advantage even before a ball is kicked' - BalagueSpain, which like England gained one of the two European Performance Spots for this season, has not fared well so far.Only Barcelona are sure of the being in the last 16, with Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the playoff round. Athletic Club and Villarreal have been eliminated.Whereas Spanish clubs used to dominate in Europe - Real Madrid won the competition twice in the past four seasons - this time they lost all but one of 10 meetings against Premier League teams in the group stage. La Liga clubs failed to score in seven matches and were beaten by an aggregate score of 21-5.BBC Sport columnist Guillem Balague describes it as \"a near-perfect storm\" which has been driven by \"collective wealth, elite decision-making off the pitch, plus a league environment that forces constant tactical evolution\". Six Premier League sides sit inside the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League, while 50% of the top 30 come from the English top flight.Balague added: \"The Premier League has the biggest budgets, but also professional structures - recruitment departments, data analysis, coaching teams and sporting directors - all working at a level that allows clubs to choose better profiles of players and managers. \"There is an advantage even before a ball is kicked.\"Balague believes only Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich can match English clubs in all the four areas of \"organised attack, structured defence, attacking transition and defensive transition\".English clubs are now fully attuned to the European style, Balague says. \"Rather than imposing something radically different, they are adapting to what Europe now requires,\" he said. \"Defensive composure, winning the duels, squeezing space and time, control of transitions and clarity in decisive moments have become more important than dominating by possession. All prepared in training by top managers and coaches.\"Balague pointed out that success in the league phase does not mean anything. The competition only really begins in the knockout rounds \"where English domination has been far less pronounced\".But Balague added: \"In any case it feels almost impossible to stop forever the domination of a league that brings every year double or more the income of other competitions.\"'The days of stupid English money are gone' - HonigsteinMedia caption, Spurs see off Frankfurt to secure automatic last 16 qualificationOf the seven meetings between German and English clubs in the league phase the Bundesliga clubs only picked up two victories. But Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all through to the knockout stages, although only Bayern go straight into the last 16. German football expert Raphael Honigstein says few people are placing too much focus on the English success so far.\"The Premier League's dominance is just denoted as a matter of fact,\" Honigstein said. \"Kicker today wrote that the top eight reflect the hegemony [dominance] of the Premier League, or reinforces it. So it's just seen as a given.\"In the past week both Dortmund and Eintracht Frankfurt lost to Spurs, who are languishing in 14th in the Premier League.It is not just about the money but how it is being used too, though. \"The days of stupid English money are gone,\" Honigstein added. \"Suddeutsche Zeitung wrote that the Premier League had learned to actually use its riches more effectively, which explains their improved performances relative to recent years.\"Honigstein also said Bodo/Glimt and Qarabag having enjoyed  success they could not have achieved in the old group-stage format.He added: \"The fact that Inter and Paris St-Germain, last year's finalists, both didn't qualify for the top eight suggests that there is a healthy sense of competition and a bit of randomness.\"I haven't seen anyone make the link that the Premier League dominance somehow invalidates or diminishes the current format.\"It's a bit of an English obsession to think that all of Europe is constantly thinking about England. People are not.\"Premier League 'increasingly resembles the Super League'Media caption, Pedro scores superb double to give Chelsea top eight finishNapoli know the dominance of the Premier League only too well after Wednesday night.Antonio Conte's side suffered a 3-2 home defeat by Chelsea which ended their Champions League campaign. Atalanta, Inter Milan and Juventus are still active but failed to make the top eight.Davide Chinellato, the UK correspondent for La Gazzetta dello Sport, says this season has only underlined opinions about the Premier League.\"Italian teams can win individual games [Atalanta beat Chelsea 2-1] but over the course of a season everyone knows Premier League sides are simply stronger,\" he said.\"They have more money, better players and more stars.\"When a fringe Premier League player like Scott McTominay can move to Serie A and dominate, or when Serie A clubs consistently target players on the margins in England, the gap becomes clear.\"Chinellato added that the view in Italy is that the Premier League \"increasingly resembles the Super League it claimed to oppose\".He said: \"It risks starting to look like unfair competition - even if that dominance has not yet fully translated into Champions League titles.\"My sense is that it will only become a real problem once Premier League teams begin winning consistently.\"While other countries have embraced the new format, Chinellato says reaction has been \"mixed\" and Italians have found it \"difficult to grasp\".Domestic financial crisis the focus in FranceFrance may have the holders of the competition, Paris St-Germain, but its sides have not had a great season.Nice failed to make the league phase, and Marseille are out now too. Monaco and PSG only made the knockout play-offs.Matt Spiro, a France-based writer and host of 'The French Football Show' on YouTube, says there has been \"little discussion\" of the Premier League's performance.PSG's failure to make the top eight is seen as a \"clear setback\" for the country's \"only realistic title contender\". They did manage to win the competition via the play-offs last season, however.\"French clubs are preoccupied with the domestic financial crisis,\" Spiro said. \"Many even rely on Premier League spending to balance their books, counting on big transfer fees for Ligue 1 talent. \"In today's L'Equipe, there is one reference to English dominance, but that carries little sense of alarm.\"The theme again was the new format \"has created more opportunities\".Sprio added: \"Last season, with Brest, Lille and Monaco all impressing in the league phase and PSG going on to win the tournament, the revamped competition appeared to generate renewed interest in France.\"For now, there is no real trepidation about English performances.\"Ligue 1 sides have held their own against Premier League opposition [with two wins, two draws, one defeat]. However, if English clubs carry this dominance into the latter stages, perceptions will surely shift.\"The BBC World Service's Sport Today show debated the topic on Thursday. Filippo Ricci, the La Liga correspondent for Gazzetta dello Sport, said the best young stars now all go to England.Ricci told the story of Carlos Vicente, who was considered to be Alaves' best player. Such is the financial strength of English football that on Wednesday he joined Championship club Birmingham. French football expert Julien Laurens believes the English dominance paints a picture of a low-quality season in which \"every league is suffering because of the calendar and the fixtures\".Constantin Eckner, a German football expert, backs the assertion that the competition is only just getting going.\"We don't know how Tottenham or maybe Liverpool will do in the knockout stage,\" Eckner said. \"There's still time and maybe the English dominance won't be that overbearing.\"And he stated only Bayern can compete as the \"second-best team in Europe behind Arsenal\" - a statement reflected by the final league phase table.Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app.There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoe PikePolitics investigations correspondentGetty ImagesJim Murphy was Secretary of State for Scotland between 2008 and 2010A lobbying firm run by an ex-Labour cabinet minister asked companies for £30,000 to sponsor an event, including a \"photo opportunity\" with a minister and access to a \"VIP dinner\" with \"top advisers\" to Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves.Arden Strategies, owned by MP turned lobbyist Jim Murphy, is hosting a \"Future of Tech Summit\" in London in July claiming attendees will be able to watch a \"fireside chat\" with Science Secretary Liz Kendall.A government source said Kendall \"was not aware of this invitation and she never agreed to attend this event\".Murphy's firm, one of the most prominent lobbyists of the Labour government, has apologised for what it described as \"errors\" and \"clumsy language\".It is unclear if it is still offering the sponsorship package.The BBC has obtained Arden's sponsorship document for the \"tech summit\" event. It shows that for £30,000 a company would be able to sponsor a drinks reception and receive a range of benefits.These include personal introductions to \"stakeholders\", a \"photo opportunity with the minister\" and one seat at a private \"VIP dinner with top advisers to the prime minister, chancellor and other senior tech policymakers\".A member of Sir Keir Starmer's team said: \"No Downing Street staff members have received a formal invitation to this dinner.\" A Treasury source said they were not aware of any of Rachel Reeves's advisers being invited.Arden Strategies said in a statement: \"Information about an event unfortunately contained very clumsy language by mistake which should never have been used and hadn't been approved. \"It was stupid to do and we apologise for this mistake. This included mentioning attendees who had not been confirmed. We are sorry for these errors.\"Arden Strategies has apologised for 'clumsy language' in its promotional materialMurphy, a former minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, founded Arden Strategies shortly after losing his parliamentary seat in 2015.It has lobbied Sir Keir's administration on behalf of arms manufacturers, oil companies and energy giants, according to the public register of consultant lobbyists.The company is not listed as a member of trade body Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA), which requires members to list all their public affairs clients.The total amount Arden spent is not known because the individual sums appear to have fallen below the threshold for sponsorship to be declared by MPs.Labour Party chair Anna Turley and business minister Blair McDougall used to work for the lobbying firm. Former Labour MP Holly Lynch is listed as a current employee.There is no suggestion Turley, McDougall or Lynch were involved in any events offering access to government employees.Murphy was a Labour MP for 18 years and held ministerial jobs in the New Labour years, including as Europe minister and Scottish secretary.He was shadow defence secretary and shadow international development secretary under Ed Miliband's leadership before briefly leading Scottish Labour and then losing his East Renfrewshire seat at the 2015 general election.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlinGetty ImagesA vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free in Germany, after a farm in Saxony benefited from a bumper harvest.Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share.Dubbed \"the great potato rescue\" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers.Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated.Ultimately it is about \"putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food,\" said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan.The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds.Not wishing to discard its \"magnificent tubers\" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine.\"We can store them until the middle of this year,\" said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes.But not everyone is celebrating.\"Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches,\" said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association.The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen.And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any \"frei Kartoffeln\" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me.Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond.However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up.One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.",

    "body": "5 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentOtherNearly 100 children were harmed by a Great Ormond Street Hospital limb reconstruction surgeon, a review has found.The investigation, published by the world-famous London hospital into Yaser Jabbar, found widespread evidence of unacceptable practice in the botched operations he carried out.Jabbar worked at the hospital between 2017 and 2022, providing care to 789 children – 94 of them came to harm, GOSH's report concluded.Most of those – 91 – were patients he did surgery on. He specialised in limb-lengthening and reconstruction for children with complex problems.The BBC has attempted to contact Jabbar. The hospital said it was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused.The treatments he provided, which included inserting metal plates, bone grafts and implants, are considered high-risk and some level of complications are to be expected.GOSH said it could not determine whether all the cases of harm were avoidable, but Jabbar's practice was substandard in many areas and this had undoubtedly caused harm.Constant painThe report highlighted cases of premature removal of bone fixation devices, operations carried out without a clear rationale, problems with how bones were pinned and making cuts into bones at the wrong level. The way complications were identified and managed was also criticised.More than a quarter of patients he operated on came to harm, the report said. Thirty-five had suffered severe harm. Another child suffered severe harm, but that was not related to surgery.The report did not detail individual cases, but families have previously spoken about the problems their children have experienced. FamilyBunty underwent multiple surgeries and her lower left leg was eventually amputatedOne girl, Bunty, who was born with a rare bone disease that caused her left leg to be bowed and short, was operated on multiple times by Jabbar and eventually had to have her lower leg amputated. This was classed as causing moderate harm.Her father, Dean Stalham, said the findings were \"too little, too late\" and the problems should have been spotted earlier.Lizzie Roberts, whose son Tate was operated on by Jabbar when he was 16 to treat the complications of a road accident 10 years previously, said the hospital had effectively \"marked its own homework\".Lizzie Roberts and Dean Stalham have both called for the police to investigate the caseShe says her son has been left in constant pain after having an unnecessary operation on his ankle that they did not consent to. The surgery was only meant to be on his knee, she says.He is now facing more surgery and has had to drop out of college. His case was also classed as one of moderate harm.Both families have asked the police to launch an investigation into the case. The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it would review the findings of the report to see if that should happen.Jabbar, who trained in the UK, is now understood to live abroad and no longer has a licence to practise medicine in the UK. Bleakest dayGOSH launched this investigation in 2024, bringing in independent doctors to review patient records, although the hospital itself pulled together their findings and have published them.The investigation was initiated after the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) carried out a review on behalf of the hospital. It came after concerns were raised by a member of staff.That review  said there were serious concerns in relation to working culture, with some staff upset about the standard of care and saying the environment was \"toxic\" and that some surgery done on children was \"inappropriate\" and \"incorrect\".Getty ImagesNHS England's London region is now carrying out a review into GOSH's handling of the case.GOSH said it had already acted on recommendations made by the RCS report, including introducing training on handling complaints, investing more in whistle-blowing support for staff and getting surgeons to discuss the most complex cases they are seeing with the National Royal Orthopaedic Hospital.Before the concerns were raised in June 2022, the trust said it had received seven complaints about Jabber and looked into one serious incident, its handling of which was signed off by NHS England. The trust insists none of these suggested further investigation or action was needed.But a surgeon who worked in the same service as Jabbar – Sarah McMahon – is reported to have raised concerns to GOSH management in autumn 2021, but said nothing was done to address her warnings at the time, according to a statement made in parliament by her local MP Dame Meg Hillier.GOSH chief executive Matthew Shaw acknowledged this was the bleakest day in the history of the hospital.He said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the harm caused, but insisted the hospital had acted \"incredibly quickly\" once concerns were raised.He said in areas like this, which were hyper-specialised and where there were only a small number of surgeons in the NHS, it was harder to detect problems with practice.But he added in publishing these findings he hoped the hospital could \"starting building trust with families again because they rely on us for many of the things that their children need\".",

It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. Now a senior source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.The Israel Defense Forces previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. The IDF said the latest reports did not represent its official position.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMichelle RobertsDigital health editorGetty ImagesPeople using GLP-1 injections like Wegovy to lose weight should be aware of the rare but real chance of developing severe inflammation of the pancreas, known as acute pancreatitis. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said symptoms to look out for include extreme pain in the stomach and back which does not go away. It advises users of the drug to see a doctor immediately if they experience this.Product information for healthcare professionals and patients regarding the risk has been updated.There have been hundreds of reports of acute and chronic pancreatitis from people who have taken drugs such as Mounjaro, Ozempic and Wegovy, although none are confirmed as being caused by the medicines.An estimated 1.6 million adults in England, Wales and Scotland are thought to have used drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro in the last year or so.Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA's chief safety officer, said patient safety was a top priority. \"For the vast majority of patients who are prescribed GLP-1s, they are safe and effective medicines which deliver significant health benefits,\" she said. \"The risk of developing these severe side effects is very small, but it is important that patients and healthcare professionals are aware and alert to the associated symptoms.\"If you, or someone you care for, is taking GLP-1s and you notice symptoms such as severe, persistent stomach pain that may radiate to the back and may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting, then we advise you speak to a healthcare professional and report it via our Yellow Card scheme.\"The pancreas is a small organ, located behind the stomach, that helps with digestion.Most people with acute pancreatitis start to feel better within about a week and have no further problems. But some people with severe acute pancreatitis can go on to develop serious complications.You should only take GLP-1 medicines if they have been prescribed to you by a healthcare professional.Always have a conversation with your prescriber about the benefits and risks of GLP-1 medicines before you start taking them or before making any changes to your treatment, such as switching to a different brand, the MHRA advises.

    "body": "4 hours agoJonny HumphriesNorth WestBBCInaayah Makda was struck by a wave as she sat on rocks on a beach in CasablancaA seven-year-old British girl is missing after being swept out to sea on the first day of a family holiday in Morocco.Inaayah Makda, from Blackburn in Lancashire, was hit by a large wave as she and her parents sat on rocks on a beach in Casablanca on Wednesday, her family have said. Her parents Zubair and Tasneem Makda were also knocked into the sea but lost sight of their daughter. A family member said the couple had spent hours on the beach screaming her name but had received little help from the authorities. Zubair and Tasneem, described as hard-working professionals, were on their first night of a week-long family holiday when it happened. A relative, who did not wish to be named, said the tide appeared to be a long way out when they first arrived on the beach but came in very quickly - within about 20 minutes - catching them by surprise. \"There were no warnings or signs there for tourists,\" she said. 'We're devastated'The family ended up cut off and surrounded by water, when a wave knocked Inaayah one way and her parents the other, the relative said.She disappeared from view before her father could reach her. The parents, who are still in Casablanca, have reportedly turned to a private search operator with a helicopter to assist with the search. A neighbour of the family, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC Inaayah, a pupil at Roe Lee Park Primary School in Blackburn, was a \"lovely, bubbly, cheeky little girl\".She said she was the only child of her \"hardworking\" parents, and was \"their whole world\".\"We're all just in shock. We're devastated,\" she said.Gillian Wilton, head teacher at Roe Lee Park Primary School, Blackburn, said: \"We are extremely upset to hear the news of Inaayah Makda, who is currently missing in Morocco.\"Our immediate and heartfelt thoughts are with her, her parents and family at this devastating time.\"We will continue to pray for Inaayah's safe return and know that all our school community will have her in their thoughts and prayers.\"The school would also like to offer our continued support to our pupils and parents.\"She asked that parents contact the school if they needed any help and support. Blackburn MP Adnan Hussain said he was \"heartbroken\" by the incident and had been in touch with Inaayah's family. He said: \"I am urgently raising this matter with the UK authorities, including the Foreign Office, to ensure every possible step is being taken to support the search efforts and to provide the family with all the assistance they require at this deeply distressing time.\"The Foreign Office said it was \"supporting the family of a British national reported missing in Morocco\" and was \"in contact with local authorities\".More like this",

    "body": "3 hours agoMetropolitan PoliceVincent Chan is already in prison after he admitted a series of offences last yearA former nursery worker who admitted sexually abusing young children in his care in north London has pleaded guilty to a further 30 charges relating to the time when he was employed at a school.In December, Vincent Chan, 45, pleaded guilty to 26 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault by touching and making indecent images depicting the most severe category of child sex abuse.At Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Thursday, Chan pleaded guilty to 12 counts of taking indecent photographs of children, six of outraging public decency, sexual assault on a female and 11 counts of voyeurism.The Met Police described him as a \"dangerous and predatory individual\".He will be sentenced on 12 February for all offences that he has now admitted.Warning: This article contains distressing detailsThe new charges relate to seven women and girls, and predate the charges he previously admitted to relating to a children's nursery.The court heard they include filming up the skirts of girls as they sat in a classroom in north London where he worked from 2007-17.Police also recovered images showing him exposing himself in a classroom in 2017, as well as videos, believed to be of Chan, depicting a solo sex act.He has also admitted a campaign of voyeurism between 2011 and 2023.The charges he admitted in December include molesting girls aged three and four while working at the Bright Horizons nursery in Finchley Road, West Hampstead.He worked there for seven years until he was suspended in 2024, after a colleague raised concerns about his activities with the children.The whistleblower complained that Chan had filmed a child falling asleep and set the footage to music, in a bid to entertain his colleagues.The Metropolitan Police investigation that followed unearthed Chan's collection of more than 25,000 indecent images of children.Among them were videos taken by Chan himself as he sexually assaulted some of the children at the nursery while they were sleeping at naptime.'Offend without intervention'Following the court hearing, lawyers at Leigh Day, who are representing some of the parents, said they were \"sickened\" to learn of Chan's further offending \"prior to his time at Bright Horizons Finchley Road\".\"These further allegations raise deeply troubling questions about how safeguarding systems could have failed so badly that someone actively offending was able to secure employment as a nursery worker and offend without intervention for a number of years.\"Bright Horizons said in a statement in December it was \"shocked and appalled\" and had commissioned an expert review of its safeguarding practices.The families of the nursery victims have been contacted directly and are receiving specialist support, while the NSPCC is running a helpline for all 700 families of children who attended the nursery during the time Chan worked there between 2017 and 2024.'Predatory individual'Det Supt Lewis Basford, who led the police investigation, said: \"Vincent Chan is a dangerous and predatory individual, and the scale of his abhorrent offending is shocking.\"Chan's history demonstrates to us that he has sought out positions of trust involving contact with young girls, which allowed him to commit his crimes unchecked for so long.\"He said that Chan had \"repeatedly exploited\" trust and was a \"danger to all women and girls\". Basford thanked the community for its support and urged anyone targeted by Chan to contact police. Related internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoJamie WhiteheadBBC News AlamyThe Royal Navy has tightened the rules of alcohol use aboard its ships to a maximum of 14 units a week per sailor. Under the new rules, Royal Navy personnel should not consume more than three units of alcohol per day and ships must enforce two alcohol-free days per week. Ships will now sell a range of zero and low alcohol drinks to encourage responsible drinking. The Navy said the new policy was in line with the UK chief medical officer's health advice and would \"ensure our people remain fit for naval operations\".  The new restrictions do not apply to sailors when they are not on board ships - including when on on-shore bases. Previous guidelines allowed sailors to have two cans of beer a day, which is roughly equivalent to more than three units, dependent on the strength.   These had to be signed out so there was a record of what had been drunk on board, and were paid for by the sailors themselves. A Navy source told the BBC that the new alcohol limits will be monitored in the same way, with sailors still paying for their own drinks. The new rules apply to all ranks but senior ratings will be able \"to use their discretion\" when applying the rules to themselves, the source added. If there were to be an incident on board where anyone drank too much and wasn't able to perform their duties effectively, the Navy source said that this would be dealt with in much the same way that it is now, which is on board the ship. The modern guidelines are a far cry from previous Royal Navy traditions. \"It was badly received. There was a lot of muttering below the decks,\" Commander David Allsop said at the time. The current UK chief medical officer's drinking guidelines, which were introduced in 2016, says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.At the time the current guidelines were announced, the UK's chief medical officers said that research showed that any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer.

    "body": "Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say4 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent Watch: The BBC's Victoria Gill looks at why are these Norwegian polar bears getting fatterScientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s, all while sea ice has steadily declined due to climate change.Polar bears rely on sea ice as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs.Researchers weighed and measured 770 adults in Svalbard between 1992 and 2019 and found that bears had become significantly fatter.They think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses.Jon Aars/Norwegian Polar InstituteResearchers weighed, measured and assessed the body condition of 770 polar bearsWatch: Where the Polar Bears Wait on BBC Iplayer Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face a warming worldDuring the same period that this research was carried out, global temperature rise has increased the number of ice-free days per year in the region by almost 100 - at a rate of about four days each year. \"The fatter a bear is the better it is,\" explained lead researcher Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute. \"And I would have expected to see a decline in body condition when the loss of sea ice has been so profound.\"Trine Lise Sviggum Helgerud/Norwegian Polar InstituteWalruses have been officially protected in Norway since the 1950s, after they were hunted to near extinction. That protection has boosted their numbers, and apparently provided a new source of fatty food for polar bears.\"There are a lot more walruses around [for them to hunt] these days,\" said Aars. \"It is also possible that they are able to hunt seals more efficiently.\" He explained that, if seals have smaller areas of sea ice available to them, they will  congregate in those smaller areas, presenting easier collective pickings for bears.Jon Aars/Norwegian Polar InstituteOther recent research on Svalbard bears showed that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubsWhile this is unexpected good news for these Arctic predators, the researchers think it is unlikely to last. As the sea ice continues to decline, bears will have to travel further to access hunting grounds, using more energy and depleting precious fat reserves.The charity Polar Bears International points out that Svalbard's polar bears were some of the most heavily-hunted in the world, until international protections were introduced in the 1970s. Experts think the new findings could be linked to the population recovering from that hunting pressure. That, combined with an increase in the number of walruses - and of reindeer - in recent decades, appears to have provided the bears with a temporary boost. Victoria Gill/BBC NewsElsewhere in the Arctic, the decline in sea ice is bringing bears closer to human communities as they search for food. Dr John Whiteman, chief research scientist at PBI said the results were \"positive in the short term\".\"But body condition is only one piece of the puzzle. Other recent research on these bears found that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubs and in subadult and old females.\"Elsewhere in the Arctic, climate change is having a very different effect on polar bears. There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. In Canada's Western Hudson Bay, where the most southerly and best studied bears live, a decline in the population has been directly linked to warming temperatures.Whiteman added that that the long-term picture for polar bears was clear - they need sea ice to survive. \"Ice loss ultimately means bear declines, but [this study shows] that the short-term picture can be very region-specific.\"\"In the long term,\" he told BBC News, \"if ice loss continues unchecked, we know the bears will eventually disappear.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoIan AikmanandBen HattonABEDIN TAHERKENAREH/EPAThe European Union has added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list in response to Tehran's deadly crackdown on protesters in recent weeks.\"Repression cannot go unanswered,\" the bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said, adding the move will put the IRGC - a major military, economic and political force in Iran - on the same level as jihadist groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the EU decision was a \"stunt\" and a \"major strategic mistake\".Human rights groups estimate thousands of protesters were killed by security forces, including the IRGC, during weeks of unrest in December and January.Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot described it as \"the most violent repression in Iran's modern history\" and said there could be \"no impunity for the crimes committed\".France had previously been seen as hesitant to add the IRGC to the EU's terror list over fears this could put an end to all diplomatic ties with Iran. But it changed course on Wednesday, coming out strongly behind a push to blacklist the group, which was led by Italy.\"Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise,\" Kaja Kallas said in a brief statement on social media.Kallas said she expected diplomatic channels to remain open with Iran, even after adding the IRGC to its list of groups involved in acts of terror.The EU has also placed new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran, including its Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad, and Iman Afshari, a presiding judge.\"They were all involved in the violent repression of peaceful protests and the arbitrary arrest of political activists and human rights defenders,\" the bloc said in a statement.Organisations on the EU's terrorist list are subject to sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, with the aim of removing their support networks.Iran's most powerful armed force, the IRGC was set up shortly after the 1979 revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It is estimated to have about 190,000 active personnel, with capabilities across land, air and sea, as well as overseeing Iran's strategic weapons.It exerts influence overseas by providing money, weapons, technology and advice to allied governments and armed groups, and also controls the paramilitary Basij Resistance Force inside Iran, which has hundreds of thousands of members and has been used to suppress dissent.Australia, Canada and the US have already classified the IRGC as a terror group but it has not been proscribed in the UK.On Wednesday, UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy condemned Iran's \"brutal oppression of peaceful protesters\" but said it was long-standing government policy \"not to comment on whether a specific organisation is being considered for proscription\".The EU's announcement comes after US President Donald Trump said a \"massive Armada\", was moving quickly towards Iran \"with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\".Handout via ReutersTrump said the fleet was headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln (file image)The Iranian foreign minister said the country's armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression.Araghchi said that rather than working to avert \"all-out war in our region\" Europe is \"busy fanning the flames\". Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the deadly crackdown on protesters earlier this month.An internet blackout imposed by Iran's authorities has made assessing the scale of the government's violence against protesters difficult.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, while another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), said the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have said more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

    "body": "43 minutes agoLaura CressTechnology reporterLuis Alvarez via Getty ImagesThe government has launched a series of free AI training courses designed to help people learn how to use the technology at work.The online lessons give advice on things such as how to prompt chatbots or use them to assist with admin tasks.Many of the courses are free, with others subsidised, and the government aims to reach 10 million workers by 2030 - calling it the most ambitious training scheme since the launch of the Open University in 1971.But the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has warned workers will need to know more than \"just how to prompt a chatbot\" as the workforce adapts to the growth of AI.\"Skills for the age of AI can't be reduced to short technical courses alone,\" said Roa Powell, senior research fellow at the IPPR.\"Workers also need support to build judgement, critical thinking, physical skills, leadership and the confidence to use these tools safely.\"Tech giants including Amazon, Google and Microsoft have helped design the AI skills training courses, with 14 courses giving those who complete them a virtual badge.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said the move was designed to help people feel confident using the tech in the workplace.\"We want AI to work for Britain, and that means ensuring Britons can work with AI,\" she said.\"Change is inevitable, but the consequences of change are not. We will protect people from the risks of AI while ensuring everyone can share in its benefits.\"Some courses are free - but others are paywalled - and lessons, which are accessible to any adult in the UK, vary in length with some lasting 20 minutes and others several hours.The NHS, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Local Government Association are among those who have committed to encouraging their staff and members to sign up.Sharron Gunn, head of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, welcomed the move - but said the onus should not only be on workers to adapt to AI.\"Alongside dedicated AI professionals, with degrees in computer science or digital apprenticeships, UK businesses of all sizes need their teams to have a benchmarked level of AI skills,\" she said.\"We also need to see far greater understanding of technology at board level, so those involved in governance of organisations, who are often giving their time unpaid, have the knowledge and confidence to scrutinise executive decisions.\"",

President Donald Trump has threatened to annex the Danish territory for what he says are national security reasons, though recently walked back comments, saying he was seeking \"immediate negotiations\" and insisting he \"won't use force\". Young is known for his political protests, and has long been a vocal critic of Trump. He announced the offer \"of peace and love\" on his website, where he added that he hoped \"other organisations will follow in the spirit of our example.\" In his statement, signed \"love earth\", Young refers to the Trump administration as \"our unpopular and hopefully temporary government\".Access to Young's digital archive usually starts at around $25 (£18), depending on the subscription package. To secure free access, a Greenland registered mobile phone number will be required for verification.Earlier this month, Young wrote on his website: \"Wake up people! Today the USA is a disaster. Donald Trump is destroying America bit by bit with his staff of wannabes... He has divided us.\" In 2020 Young took legal action to try to stop Trump using his music at campaign rallies.Young has also called on people to boycott Amazon over owner Jeff Bezos's donations to the Trump campaign and support for the administration. In 2022, he told Spotify to remove hits like Harvest Moon and Heart of Gold, complaining that Rogan was spreading vaccine misinformation on the streaming service. Other artists, including Joni Mitchell and India Arie, also removed their songs in solidarity.The singer said at the time that his return did not reflect a reversal of his stance, but that the decision came after Rogan signed a $250m (£181m) deal to make his podcast available on multiple platforms, rather than remaining a Spotify exclusive.Neil Young was born in Canada but later moved to the US and holds dual citizenship.

    "body": "27 minutes agoSofia Ferreira SantosCheyenne Hangaman says she tried to save her three children by lifting them out of the waterThree young brothers have died in Bonham, north Texas, after falling through ice on a private pond on Monday.Cheyenne Hangaman, the boys' mother, said she tried to rescue them by lifting them out of the water and placing them on the ice, but it kept breaking.\"There was three of them and only one of me... that's why I couldn't save them,\" she told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.She described her sons, aged six, eight and nine, as full of personality and urged families to \"make sure that you hold your kids tight, always tell them that you love them\".This story contains graphic content that some readers may find distressing.Hangaman, a mother of six, first learned of the accident when her daughter ran over to her, shouting that the boys had fallen in.The children had been out playing near the pond, about 100ft (30m) away from the house where the family had been staying. The youngest fell through first after trying to \"ice skate\" on the layer of ice on the water, Hangaman said, adding that the two older boys then jumped in after him.\"When I seen them, they were struggling, and I know their bodies were already in shock,\" she said. \"The water was freezing cold.\"AFPHangaman said she had warned the boys to stay away from the waterWhile trying to save them, she began to struggle and was rescued by a neighbour.\"I tried to fight for my kids' life, where I had to watch them struggle and drown and I couldn't help them,\" she said.The neighbour, a football coach at the school the boys attended, heard her screams and was able to pull her out of the water.\"He said he heard the screaming or the call for help and came running. My friend had a horse rope, and he pulled me out with it,\" Hangaman said.In a statement, the local sheriff's office said the two older boys were pulled out of the water first by emergency workers and a neighbour, and taken to a local hospital.The six-year-old was later recovered after \"an extensive search of the pond\", the office added.Handout/AFP(From left to right) Kaleb, Howard and EJ were full of personality, their mother saidAuthorities did not release the children's names, but family members identified them as Howard Doss, six, Kaleb Doss, eight, and EJ Doss, nine.Describing her sons, Hangaman said EJ dreamed of becoming a football star, Kaleb loved to dance and sing, and the youngest, Howard, \"liked making people laugh\".The boys' school said they were \"devastated by this unimaginable loss\" in a letter to families seen by CBS News and that counsellors would be available to meet students and staff.",

    "body": "Ecuador says ICE agent attempted to enter its Minneapolis consulate49 minutes agoVanessa BuschschlüterLatin America editor, BBC News OnlinePhoto by Jim Watson - Pool/Getty ImagesICE agents are among the 3,000 officers deployed to the region as part of a crackdown on immigrantsThe government of Ecuador has condemned what it described as an attempt by a US federal immigration agent to enter the Ecuadorean consulate in Minneapolis.The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted \"to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time\", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said. Ecuador, whose president is an ally of Trump, has filed an official complaint.The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had \"tried to enter the premises of the consulate\" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located \"shall not enter\" the parts of the consulate used for work \"except with the consent of the head of the consular post\".Ecuador said that its officials had not consented to ICE entering the consulate. While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where \"prompt protective action\" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent \"this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here\".The agent tells the official that \"if you touch me, I will grab you\". The consular official then states again that \"you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office\", before closing the door. In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had \"immediately\" handed a an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.The protest letter constitutes a rare note of discord between Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and the Trump administration. Just over two months ago, the two presidents agreed to strengthen their countries' commercial and economic relationship and Noboa has in the past thanked Trump for designating two Ecuadorean criminal gangs as Foreign Terrorist Organisations.The actions of immigration and border agents in Minneapolis - in particular the fatal shooting of Pretti on 24 January and that of Renee Good on 7 January -  have triggered protests in the city and beyond. There are currently 3,000 immigration agents and officers in the region. Securing the US's borders and implementing tougher enforcement of immigration rules has been one of Trump's top priorities. According to a 20 January statement by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, her department removed \"more than 675,000 illegal aliens\" from the US since Trump was sworn in to a second term a year ago.

    "body": "Teacher uses 40-year-old law to withdraw from teaching religion4 hours agoRobbie MeredithEducation and arts correspondent, BBC News NIBBCJaved Love is understood to be the first teacher in Northern Ireland in at least a decade to take the actionA primary school teacher has used a conscience clause in a 40-year-old law to withdraw from teaching religious education (RE).Javed Love is understood to be the first teacher in Northern Ireland in at least a decade to take the action.He told BBC News NI that he was not \"anti-Christian,\" and did not \"have a problem teaching children about Christianity\".He said there was currently a system where \"one worldview is dominant\".\"I just think it places a burden on a six-year-old or a seven year-old to understand where Christianity sits in relation to other religions or no religion,\" he said.What law did the teacher use to withdraw from RE?The Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, requires that schools hold \"collective worship whether in one or more than one assembly\" every day.The law also requires RE \"based upon the holy scriptures\" to be delivered, though in some schools' boards of governors have more say in what RE is delivered as long as it is in line with the curriculum.But under that same order a teacher in a controlled school has the right to withdraw from teaching RE or attending collective worship like assemblies.Article 22 of the order says a teacher may make a request to school governors to withdraw \"solely on grounds of conscience\".Love said he had decided to use the clause as in his role as a teacher he feels the \"need to be able to stand over everything\" he tells his pupils.\"Religious education and collective worship, it's all one perspective,\" he said.\"I don't think it enables the pupils to think about these things critically, and to make informed decisions about what they do or don't believe.\"Love had the backing of Northern Ireland Humanists, which said the option to withdraw was \"virtually unknown\" among teachers.Parents have the right by law to withdraw their children from RE and collective worship like school assemblies.A Freedom of Information request submitted by Love established that he was the first teacher in at least a decade to use the conscience clause.The 1986 law, though, only refers to teachers in controlled schools, those who are under the management of boards of governors and the Education Authority.Northern Ireland Humanists said that meant there was currently no explicit right for teachers in integrated or Catholic maintained schools to withdraw from providing RE or taking part in collective worship.Is this related to the recent Supreme Court judgement?While the Supreme Court judgement was significant and is likely to lead to change in the way RE is taught, it did not directly affect Love's case.The Supreme Court judgement said the case was \"not about secularism in the education system,\" and that \"historically and today, Christianity is the most important religion in Northern Ireland\".But the judges ruled RE was not taught in \"an objective, critical, and pluralistic manner,\" and that could amount to \"indoctrination\".Love said he would be in favour of reform of the RE curriculum, and said he would \"100%\" teach the subject if it was reformed.What happens with his class if he does not teach them RE?Love has been a teacher for 13 years and as a primary school teacher, teaches his pupils a range of subjects.In school, when it is time for RE, another teacher takes his class and he teaches their class a different subject.When religious assemblies are taking place he supervises the pupils whose parents have withdrawn them.\"Practically it works out OK, as when there are religious visitors in school if there are any pupils who have been withdrawn from that, I then have the responsibility to provide an alternative activity for those pupils,\" he said.Love said deciding to make a formal request to withdraw from teaching RE and attending collective worship had been \"difficult\".\"You run the risk of appearing anti-Christian and truly I'm not,\" he said.\"I wouldn't want friends or family who are Christian to feel that.\"Love added that RE remains \"import and valuable\" and there is \"absolutely a better way than what we do now.\"More on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoKali HaysSan FranciscoEPAUS technology giant Amazon has confirmed it will cut 16,000 jobs - hours after it told staff about a new round of global redundancies in an email apparently sent in error.The email, which has been seen by the BBC, was sent late on Tuesday and refers to  a swathe of employees in the US, Canada and Costa Rica having been laid off as part of an effort to \"strengthen the company.\"The message was apparently shared by mistake, as it was quickly cancelled. Early on Wednesday, Amazon announced job reductions as part of a plan to \"remove bureaucracy\" at the firm.Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, said on Wednesday it was not planning to make \"broad reductions every few months\", referring to Amazon's announcement of 14,000 job cuts in October.\"While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now,\" she said.Project DawnOn Tuesday, a draft email written by Colleen Aubrey, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services (AWS), was included in a calendar invitation sent by an executive assistant to a number of Amazon workers.The title of the invitation was \"Send project Dawn email,\" an apparent reference to Amazon's code name for the job cuts.While the email made clear that layoffs were happening at Amazon, employees had not yet been officially informed.\"This is a continuation of the work we've been doing for more than a year to strengthen the company by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy, so that we can move faster for customers,\" the email said.\"Changes like this are hard on everyone. These decisions are difficult and made thoughtfully as we position our organization and AWS for future success,\" it added.The 16,000 job cuts had been expected by Amazon employees for weeks, according to a former employee who asked not be identified.The broad understanding among employees had been that bosses intended to cut a total of around 30,000 roles, added the former employee, who left the company as part of the cuts in October.The firm was expected to reach that number of job cuts with another major round of layoffs this month, followed by further redundancies until the end of May.While laid-off workers were invited to reapply for open positions at Amazon, the number of such roles was limited. People who did not move to another role received severance pay based on how long they had worked at the company.Since 2022, major tech companies like Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft and others have slashed their workforces by laying off tens of thousands of people each year.Across the entire tech industry, an estimated 700,000 people have been laid off over the last four years, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts.So far this year, Facebook owner Meta has cut more roles, impacting several hundred employees. As has Pinterest, which this week cut around 700 jobs.'Time to rethink'Since Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stood down as its chief executive four years ago, his successor Andy Jassy has led the company through several rounds of layoffs in 2023, 2024 and 2025.Jassy has also attempted to bring a more strict work culture to the firm.In-office work is now mandatory five-days a week, making Amazon one of the only major tech companies to require its employees to be in the office full-time.Amazon is also focused on reducing costs, even monitoring corporate mobile phone use by AWS employees, according to a report in Business Insider, in an effort to limit a long-standing $50 per month reimbursement. In an email Jassy sent to employees before the Thanksgiving holiday viewed by the BBC, the CEO said he was thankful for the \"challenges at opportunities at work\" as \"the world is changing at a very rapid rate.\" Jassy called this era at Amazon \"a time to rethink everything we've ever done.\"Earlier on Tuesday, the company announced it would close its roughly 70 remaining Amazon-branded grocery stores, Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go, and expand its Whole Foods Market business.Additional reporting by Mitch Labiak",

    "body": "3 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaThe Rwandan government is claiming it is owed £100m by the UK over payments due under an asylum agreement cancelled by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.Rwanda has filed an international arbitration case, arguing the UK has breached the terms of the deal to send some asylum seekers to the east African nation.Under the deal, which was signed by the previous Conservative government, the UK agreed to make payments to Rwanda to host asylum seekers who had arrived illegally in Britain.In a statement, Rwanda's government said it had decided to pursue claims in arbitration after facing the UK's \"intransigence on these issues\".A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The previous government's Rwanda policy wasted vast sums of taxpayer time and money.\"We will robustly defend our position to protect British taxpayers.\"The Rwandan government's statement said it was making three claims in relation to the Migration and Economic Development Partnership, which was signed in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister.The statement accuses the UK of breaching the deal by setting out the financial terms of the agreement publicly, failing to make payments totalling £100m, and \"refusing to make arrangements to resettle vulnerable refugees from Rwanda\".As part of the partnership, the UK had agreed to resettle a small number of vulnerable refugees who were already being hosted in Rwanda and had not been sent there from Britain.In 2022, the Home Office said this was expected to amount to \"tens\" of cases, involving people who have complex needs, such as acute health problems.The previous Conservative government spent some £700m on the Rwanda policy, which was intended to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.Only four volunteers arrived in Rwanda when the deal was in force and Sir Keir said the plan was \"dead and buried\", shortly after Labour won the 2024 general election.The deal included a break clause, which said \"each party may terminate this agreement by giving notice to the other party in writing\".The £700m included £290m of payments to Rwanda.In December 2024, the Home Office said a further £100m of payments would have been due under the treaty, £50m in each of the 2025-26 and 2026-27 financial years.In addition, the Home Office agreed to pay £120m upon the transfer of 300 people to Rwanda.In its statement, the Rwandan government said in November 2024, the UK requested that Rwanda forgo two payments of £50m that were due in April 2025 and April 2026.The statement added: \"Rwanda indicated it was prepared to accept these arrangements should the treaty be terminated, provided that new financial terms would be negotiated and agreed.\"Discussions between Rwanda and the United Kingdom did not however ultimately take place and the amounts remain due and payable under the treaty.\"Rwanda's government said the UK had \"made clear that it has no intention of making any further payment\" under the treaty, or honouring \"its further commitment to make arrangements to resettle in the UK a portion of the most vulnerable refugees hosted in Rwanda\".\"Disappointingly, Rwanda's attempts to move the UK from its entrenched position have been unsuccessful,\" the statement said.It said the UK notified Rwanda of the termination of the treaty after responding to the east African country's notice of arbitration in November last year.Rwanda said the formal termination of the treaty will take effect on 16 March 2026.The Home Office has been contacted for a further comment.In the treaty signed by Rwanda and the UK, both countries agreed any dispute that could not be settled among themselves would be referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).The PCA, which is headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, is a forum for resolving international disputes between states.It is a process that is similar to arbitration that companies regularly agree to as an alternative to potentially damaging and lengthy court battles.The PCA has the power to issue binding, final rulings if disputes cannot be settled by the countries involved.The PCA has not yet indicated how and when the complaint from Rwanda will be handled.The arbitration body typically sets a timetable with the parties specifying when they need to present their arguments - and the cases can take years to resolve.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the legal action was \"yet another catastrophic consequence of Labour's decision to scrap the Rwanda scheme before it even started\".\"This legal action means the British taxpayer is now facing a huge bill for Labour's weakness and incompetence,\" Philp said.He said Labour was \"too weak to see this crucial policy through, and it's the British taxpayer who is left to pay the price\".The UK government previously said it was looking at what money could be recouped after scrapping the scheme.But the Rwandan government has said it is under \"no obligation\" to refund any money.",

    "body": "Novak Djokovic is planning to double his thanks tonight.Partly in gratitude for what has happened so far at the Australian Open. Partly in hope for what lies ahead as he chases a record 25th Grand Slam singles title.Djokovic could not hide his relief when Italian fifth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who led their quarter-final by two sets to love, had to quit with injury.It was more fortune for the 10-time Melbourne champion, having already received a fourth-round walkover when Czech opponent Jakub Mensik withdrew with an abdominal issue.Feeling fresh is a positive for the 38-year-old Serb going into Friday's semi-final against Jannik Sinner.But equally, being undercooked against the 24-year-old Italian, who is bidding for a third straight title, is a worry.Djokovic has played just two sets since his third-round win on 24 January - and he lost both of those.\"I have no idea at this stage of my career what serves me [well] and what doesn't,\" fourth seed Djokovic said.Djokovic says he largely feels fine physically, with a blister on his foot his biggest concern.It is a marked difference to some of his previous Australian Open campaigns.Last year, he quit in the semi-finals because of a hamstring tear sustained in a super-human effort to beat Carlos Alcaraz in the previous round.In 2023, he won the title despite playing with a three centimetre tear in his hamstring. Two years earlier, he also triumphed despite tearing an abdominal muscle in the third round.Djokovic cannot afford any physical issues if he is going to beat Sinner and then potentially 22-year-old Alcaraz in Sunday's final.\"You always have some minor issues with your body, at least for me every single day,\" Djokovic said.\"But major issues, no. Thankfully, that's still not posing a challenge for me and obstacle in order for me to be able to play and move around the way I want to.\"Djokovic feels being injury-free is a stroke of luck as he attempts to become the oldest Grand Slam men's champion in the Open era.Considering his meticulous pursuit of almost every record there is in the sport, it feels wrong to put anything Djokovic down to fortune.But avoiding a default in the third round, followed by a walkover and then a retirement, is an enviable pattern.Against Musetti, Djokovic also recovered from falling victim to his own exemplary sportsmanship.As he served to stay in the second set, Djokovic conceded a point by admitting to umpire James Keothavong he touched a ball on its way out. The Italian would go on to claim the game.\"I'm going to double my prayers tonight,\" Djokovic said.There is no doubt Djokovic needs to be sharper both technically and mentally if he is to end Sinner and Alcaraz's recent dominance at the majors.Musetti was superb against Djokovic, but there was no escaping the fact the Serb was poor by his lofty standards.\"I think I've underperformed for the level that I showed throughout this tournament,\" Djokovic added.\"I have to play better - no doubt about it.\"I know that if I'm feeling well and the body is holding on and I'm playing well, then I always have a chance.\"",

They have to make their position very clear, that's what we ask them.</p><p>\"Our review needs to be very detailed, very analytical, it needs to take into account the point of view of our two drivers, and then we will form a common opinion based on which we will see whether we can just confirm our initial interpretation or there's something else that we should conclude.</p><p>\"Every time we start our conversations with the drivers, we always remind ourselves, as a premise: 'This is hard'.</p><p>\"Because this is the only matter in which, when you race together as a team, actually you can't have exactly the same interest for the two drivers, because they want to pursue their aspiration.

It equals Red Bull's feat in winning with six races to go in 2023, although that was a 22-race season compared with 24 this year.</p><p>It is also not as early in percentage terms as McLaren's 1988 title with Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost and the great McLaren-Honda MP4/4.</p><p>But the car has not had the superiority over the field shown by the winners in either of those years.</p><p>Red Bull won all but one race, and Verstappen all but three, in 2023. McLaren this year have had the best car, but crucially two drivers able to consistently win with it, while Sergio Perez faded badly after his two early wins that year.</p><p>Piastri and Norris have won 12 of the 18 races so far, seven for Piastri and five for Norris. Verstappen has four wins and Russell two.</p><p>McLaren's achievement is remarkable for the fact that it came in a season that was meant to be one of the most competitive in years.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cy7kgg5lxeeo\">McLaren's title last year was won at the final race</a> under severe pressure from Ferrari, and as this is the final year of the current regulations, the teams were expected to converge further.</p><p>McLaren, though, caught them all on the hop with their MCL39 car, which has proved its superiority through devastating cornering speeds particularly in medium-speed turns, which are the most common on the calendar, and the best tyre usage on the grid.</p><p>It is not without its flaws - it does not excel in heavy braking and traction, or over bumps. But it is, as well as being arguably the most beautiful car on the grid with its elegant lines, especially seen from the side or rear three-quarters, also the most effective on average.</p><p>The key to this, says Stella, was \"innovation\". In suspension design front and rear, which have extreme levels of anti-dive and anti-lift to ensure a stable aerodynamic platform. In aerodynamics. And in cooling - the car has noticeably fewer and smaller vents than others, a key advantage when every extra opening of the bodywork has a cost in aerodynamic efficiency.</p><p>Stella said: \"There was loads of innovation applied to what was last year's car, and this required quite a bit of bravery at some stage of the 2024 season to commit to the amount of changes that we have applied to go from the 2024 to the 2025 car.</p><p>\"I talk about bravery, because our engineering understanding, our engineering execution has been challenged to the point of the leading edge of our knowledge.\"</p></div><div><p>McLaren's advantage has reduced as the season heads into its final stages. That is partly because of the characteristics of the three most recent circuits not suiting its capabilities, and partly because McLaren turned off the taps of development some time ago, and Mercedes and Red Bull still have new parts coming to their cars - both had new front wings here.</p><p>That decision by McLaren was rooted in the fact that they were seeing diminishing returns in developing this car, common when a design has such an advantage at the start of a season, and that they wanted to ensure they were well prepared for next year, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cgeeqr817xxo\">new chassis and engine rules</a> could turn F1 on its head.</p><p>Norris, though, is well aware of the scale of his team's achievement, and the remarkable turnaround they have shown under Stella and chief executive officer Zak Brown from just over two years ago, when they started the 2023 season close to the back of the field.</p><p>There is also the context of the budget cap, and the fact that as world champions, the rules dictated that they were permitted less aerodynamic development time than any other team.</p><p>\"Another one is a great thing,\" Norris said. \"If you look where we were three years ago, we have outdone every team in terms of development in a time when it is harder to do with more restrictions and less wind tunnel time.</p><p>\"In a time when it should be more difficult than ever to dominate, that's exactly what the team has done and given us, by a long way, the best car on the grid.</p><p>\"That's always a very nice thing to say. It always puts a smile on your face. But we've also done very well as a team in terms of drivers, between Oscar and myself pushing each other and delivering every single weekend. You don't see that in any other team.</p><p>\"I've been with McLaren since I started. It was a very different time and place then to where we are now.</p><p>\"So that journey makes it more special - to know the downs, because that's a lot of what it was back then - to see the rise we've had, to see the teamwork, the changes, the atmosphere difference, and the leadership from Zak and Andrea especially, has turned things around and made us the best team in the world.</p><p>\"That's something not many people ever get to say.\"</p></div><section><p></p><h2>More on this story</h2><p></p></section></article>",

And it happened all too suddenly.\"</p><p>Tibet's Blue Sky Rescue team had received a call for help saying that tents had collapsed due to heavy snow, and that some hikers were already suffering from hypothermia, Chinese state media reported. </p><p>Tingri County Tourism Company suspended ticket sales and entry to Everest Scenic Area from Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. </p><p>The region is facing extreme weather at the moment, as neighbouring Nepal has been battered by heavy rains which triggered landslides and flash floods that have washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people in the last two days. </p><p>In China, Typhoon Matmo has made landfall, forcing about 150,000 people to evacuate from their homes. </p><p>Mount Everest is the world's highest peak at over 8,849m. Although many people attempt to climb the summit every year, it is considered an incredibly dangerous hike. </p><p>In recent years it has been plagued with concerns of overcrowding, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq5539lj1pqo\">environmental concerns</a> and a series of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-65680598\">fatal climbing attempts.</a></p></div>",

the opening day of the Conservative Party Conference\" /><span>Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>It is far from unusual to see tributes to Margaret Thatcher at Conservative party conferences.</p><p>But the ghost of the Iron Lady hangs particularly heavily at this year's annual gathering in Manchester, as activists celebrate 100 years since her birth in 1925.</p><p>Along with the customary cardboard cut-outs and decorative gift mugs, a special exhibition stand is displaying a selection of the former Conservative prime minister's most famous outfits from her 11 years in office.</p><p>Delegates can have their photo taken for a Thatcher mosaic projected on a wall, whilst a cocktail bar has been booked for a \"Maggie's 100th\" party, with a live DJ ready to blast out \"everyone's favourite disco hits\". </p></div><div><p>That the party faithful would turn to their most successful leader at this particular point in time is not surprising, even if outsiders might question the party's continued fascination with a leader it ejected from office more than 30 years ago.</p><p>Kemi Badenoch, who is preparing to mark her own one-year anniversary as Tory leader next month, is grappling with how to revive the Tories after their election drubbing last year and subsequent slump in the polls.</p><p>She has reportedly turned to Mrs T's legacy herself for inspiration, reading a book about her predecessor's early years in power.</p><p>But the party has also been debating whether the Thatcherite era holds any lessons for Badenoch, as she faces the task of restoring her party's fortunes.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Lanyard classes'</h2><p></p><div><p>Robert Colvile, who co-authored the Tories' 2019 election manifesto and now runs the Centre for Policy Studies think tank set up by Thatcher in the mid-1970s, says Badenoch today is facing a different economic backdrop.</p><p>But speaking at a fringe event to mark the anniversary, he suggested she could draw from Thatcher when it comes to identifying the party's political targets.</p><p>Whilst the former PM waged war with unions and state-backed industry, he said the Tories today should look to rein in the \"lanyard classes\" running government bodies \"constraining the growth of enterprise\".</p><p>John Redwood, a former Tory MP who once headed up Thatcher's policy unit in Downing Street, said the British energy industry could provide a similar cause for the party's activists to rally behind.</p><p>The sector, he added, had become \"like a nationalised industry\" due to the scale of public subsidies and \"bans and blocks\" to enforce net-zero targets.</p></div><figure><div><p><img

conference</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Conservative MP Esther McVey told party members that Thatcher would be \"spinning in her grave\" at GB Energy, the new company set up by Labour to invest in green energy projects.</p><p>McVey also argued that the party could take a leaf out of Thatcher's book when it comes to the task of rebuilding its reputation as a competent custodian of the British economy. </p><p>It is perhaps the key message the party wants to get across this week, as it seeks to present Nigel Farage's spending plans as a threat to the public finance.</p><p>McVey, a former work and pensions secretary, said Reform UK's promise to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yx062pvlvo\">scrap the two-child benefit cap</a>, a policy backed by the Lib Dems and also under consideration by Labour, could leave the Tories as the only main party pushing to keep the limit in place.</p><p>\"The economy is where the Conservatives are going to get their breakthrough,\" she added. \"That is, I think, going to be our separation, our USP.\"</p><p>Redwood pointed out that Thatcher also faced an electoral challenge from a new party, in the shape of the SDP, which polled as high as 50% in the 1980s as part of an alliance with the Liberals.</p><p>He added that the Tories didn't \"spend our time talking about or worrying about the social democrats,\" instead focusing on \"being Conservatives\".</p><p>As the governing party at the time, he added, it was \"incumbent on us\" to show the party could deliver its policy programme.</p><p>If Badenoch can repeat the trick in opposition, it could decide whether she can lead her party back into government.</p></div></article>",

Do the new Epstein files \"absolve\" Trump?AmericastAvailable for over a yearThe Department of Justice has said that their review process into files related to Jeffrey Epstein is over, after a new tranche was released on Friday.  Donald Trump says the lack of evidence in this batch absolves him of any guilt, while survivors and Democrats say there are still unanswered questions and unseen documents. \nJustin, Sarah, Marianna and Anthony discuss where this leaves the president and his MAGA base.  Also, what does it mean for Epstein's victims, particularly as many victims’ names have been published by the US DoJ for the first time without permission.  \nWe also answer your questions on celebrities calling out the actions of ICE agents in Minneapolis at the Grammys as Trump threatens to sue its host Trevor Noah. Plus, why quilters on social media might have more to do with those ongoing protests than meets the eye.\nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray and Grace Reeve.

Now contemplating downsizing, they wanted to tackle the clutter of things accumulated over decades with their two children, Katie and Simon.  Their children weren't keen to help but daughter-in-law Louise offered to step in.\"She was up for the challenge and it made it less stressful,\" says Angie. \"Decluttering brings back memories and it's hard but she made it fun.\"Louise says she was happy to help lighten the load. \"I love Angie and I wanted to help because I know the experience can be overwhelming and difficult.\"Another tip Angie shares is her technique of splitting clutter into small boxes which she tackled one at a time \"in a relaxed way\".\"I look at everything, is it rubbish? Has it got another life? Can I sell it? Should it go to the hospice?\" she says.Angie says she has got rid of hundreds of items by either selling on Vinted or donating. \"It can be such a lovely process to revisit things that you've had from your past and to be able to see it one last time before it goes.\" she says.I kept two boxes of sentimental itemsSarah ThompsonSarah and her husband Steve in their former home of the ShetlandsAuction enthusiast Sarah had bid her way to a big collection of ornaments and trinkets which filled her three-bedroom house in Shetland.She had two months to declutter before moving to a smaller house in Manchester and Sarah says putting a limit on items from each room helped.\"I made this deal with myself - you can have two boxes of sentimental items, things that you really don't want to get rid of and things that really mean something.\"She says she felt \"torn\" because she loved everything she had bought over the years but ended up making well over £100 selling her clutter. \"A lot of items were old or interesting and came with a story - I loved the enthusiasm of those buying what I sold,\" she says.\"We had various old vintage items, including an antique grain bin which was part of Shetland history, which we ending up selling to a pub on the island.\"Sarah was also able to donate to charity shops and says it felt great to move to Manchester for a fresh start without clutter. I took photos of everythingGetty ImagesSusan found taking pictures of things was the best way to keep the memory while losing the item.She did this with her ornaments, which she has donated to charity shops, and is planning to do the same thing with her physical photographs.Susan also has an abundance of cards dating all the way back to the year she got married in 1979.\"We kept all our special cards, so once a week, for an hour or two, I will scan cards in for a particular year and then [they will] always be there if I need them.\"She also reuses the old cards to new ones and has let go of old cassettes and CDs.\"You can listen to stuff on YouTube,\" she says. \"We've only kept stuff that we can't get anymore.\"I decluttered one thing a dayJenni began her decluttering a few years ago by committing to throw away one thing every day.\"Some days I did more than one thing, some went to charity shops, some went in the bin, some went to the tip,\" she says.By practising this habit every day, she says she was able to train her brain to let go of things more easily, making decluttering a lot easier now than before she started.\"It wasn't overwhelming. If I'd said, 'I'm going to declutter the spare room', I think I would have had to go to bed for a week with shock, but because I thought, I will take one thing out of the spare room and get rid of it it was a method.\"Other stories you may enjoy",

The coastguard has not yet clarified the exact circumstances around the collision. A search and rescue operation was ongoing on Tuesday night, which involved four coastguard vessels, a privately owned boat carrying civilian divers, and a helicopter.Greek state broadcaster ERT said the injured included seven children, a pregnant woman and two coastguard officers.Four deaths were initially reported but an update issued at 23:00 local time (21:00 GMT) said ten additional bodies had been recovered, bringing the confirmed death toll to 14.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAll the papers lead with the police investigation into Lord Peter Mandelson and former Prince Andrew's relocation from the Royal Lodge, all flowing from the fallout of the Epstein files revelations. \"Cops probe Mandelson\" is the Daily Star's headline, noting it comes \"hours after he quit the Lords\". In the lead up to Lord Mandelson's resignation, the prime minister \"had said he'd change the law to boot him out\", the paper reports. The BBC has contacted Lord Mandelson for comment and understands that his position is that he denies engaging in criminal behaviour.The Financial Times focuses on criminal allegations of \"misconduct in public office\" levelled against Lord Mandelson. The claims relate to emails released by the US Justice Department revealing correspondence between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Lord Mandelson. In these exchanges, \"sensitive details\" were allegedly passed on to the disgraced financier at the height of the global financial crisis, the paper says, when Lord Mandelson was UK business secretary.The criminal probe into Lord Mandelson is also the Times's top story. The paper notes that misconduct in public office, of which the former Labour grandee is accused, \"carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment\".\"Mandelson goes as Epstein crisis grows\" is the Metro's take, noting it could mark the end of the peer's \"47-year political career\". The paper reports Sir Keir Starmer told a Cabinet meeting that he was \"appalled\" by the \"gobsmacking\" revelations, adding that the former Labour minister \"let the country down\".\"He let his country down\", is the Independent's headline, quoting the prime minister, above a photo of Lord Mandelson.No 10 Downing Street has passed on a \"dossier to Met Police\" as part of its investigation, the i Paper says. It follows the Cabinet Office's assessment that Mandelson's emails to Epstein \"likely contained market sensitive information\" for the UK economy.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown \"goes to war with Government over Mandelson's leaked emails to Epstein\" leads the Daily Telegraph. The paper writes \"Brown has dragged Britain's most senior public servant into the Mandelson scandal, questioning why he failed to launch an investigation last autumn\". It also reports that Brown has passed on \"relevant\" information to the police about Lord Mandelson, who served as business secretary while Brown was PM. People close to Brown tell the BBC they object to the Daily Telegraph's headline, saying the former PM was \"in no ways... seeking to accuse No10 of a cover up in what he said in his statement\".\"Inexcusable\" is the Daily Mirror's splash, quoting Gordon Brown who describes Lord Mandelson's actions as \"inexcusable and unpatriotic\". The Daily Mail characterises Lord Mandelson as \"Labour's dark lord\", referring to his years accruing a reputation as a political fixer and \"spin doctor\". The paper adds that Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch \"piles pressure on PM\" over the Mandelson scandal.The Guardian leads with the \"Met investigation into Mandelson\", adding that the ex-business secretary has resigned from the House of Lords. The paper also reports investigators are looking into new allegations that Epstein \"provided Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with a woman to have sex with at the Royal Lodge in 2010\". While he has not responded directly to the most recent allegations, the former prince has always denied wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.The Sun reports that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor \"got the boot from Royal Lodge under cover of darkness\", writing that the eviction from Windsor came earlier than planned. The former prince is currently living at a temporary property on the Sandringham Estate. The Duke of Edinburgh's \"call 'to remember the victims' of evil Epstein\" leads the Daily Express. Prince Edward's intervention makes him the \"first royal to respond to the latest Epstein files release in which his brother Andrew features\", the paper writes. Related Internet Links",

    "body": "36 minutes agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesSir Brian Leveson pictured in his former role as Lord Justice Leveson in 2015The court system is \"on the brink of collapse\" as the backlogs for trials reach unprecedented levels, the head of a major review has said.Sir Brian Leveson, a senior retired judge, warned ministers, the police and others that there could not be a \"pick and mix\" response to solving the crisis.Last year, in the first stage of the review, Sir Brian called for the right to a jury trial to be scaled back and many intermediate crimes to be dealt with by a judge alone.His second and final report has recommended 130 efficiency changes, from technical measures to allowing prison vans to use bus lanes to hit court appearance deadlines.Sir Brian's two reports were commissioned by ministers as part of an attempt to reverse the backlogs that had reached record levels before Labour came into power, but have continued to worsen since then.Last September, the backlog of trials waiting to come to Crown Court in England and Wales was 79,619 cases, double the level seen before the pandemic.It is on track to hit 100,000 cases by November next year and some suspects being charged with offences today are already being told their cases won't be dealt with until 2030.That in turn has led to victims saying they are losing confidence in the system and walking away from the court process.The crisis has deep roots in cuts to spending on courts, judges and barristers. The impact of those decisions in the 2010s has been exacerbated by the pandemic, lawyers quitting criminal work over poor pay while the recruitment of extra police has led to more suspects being sent to court.Sir Brian said that his reports must not lead to a \"pick and mix job\"  but all agencies must act quickly.\"I have never seen pressure on the courts at such an unacceptable level - the system stands on the brink of collapse,\" he said.\"It is failing victims. It is failing witnesses, and on top of that, it's not even good for defendants who wish to challenge the allegations made against them, but whose lives are equally on hold waiting for the court date to appear.\"The one thing we do not have is the luxury of great time.\"Sir Brian's recommendations include appointing a dedicated criminal justice adviser working directly to the prime minister in the heart of government to oversee efficiency reforms to the courts, prisons, prosecutors and police.His 130 other recommendations include:Increasing the use of video remote hearings in courtsAllowing prison vans to use bus lanes to get defendants to courts on time - delays in delivering suspects from prisons is a huge daily problemCut the work police need to do to prepare a file for prosecutors at the start of a caseMore use of artificial intelligence tools to prepare cases and schedule themMaking better use of empty courtrooms - another daily problem\"They [ministers] can pick out bits of this immediately,\" he said. \"The police can pick out bits immediately. The Crown Prosecution Service can pick out bits immediately. The courts, the Judiciary, can pick out bits immediately.\"The Criminal Bar Association, representing barristers who work in crown and magistrates courts, reiterated its opposition to cuts to jury trials, saying there is no evidence that the proposed major constitutional reform would solve the crisis.Its leaders said local solutions in regional crown courts had shown that backlogs could be reduced and the government needed to learn lessons and fund more such programmes.\"[Sir Brian] has produced a full a MOT test report on the criminal justice system,\" said Riel Karmy-Jones KC and Andrew Thomas KC.\"His report is an 800 page list of failures and requirements for immediate action. Just like maintaining a car, you can't just fix one component and ignore the rest.\"If the MoJ and the Treasury do not act on this, the criminal justice system is going to end up on the scrapheap.\"Responding to the report, Deputy Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor David Lammy said the government would respond to the recommendations in the coming weeks.\"Efficiencies alone are not a silver bullet, but making the system more efficient and saving time across the board is a vital part of a wider package to tackle the problem of victims suffering for years for their cases to be heard,\" he said.\"We inherited a creaking justice system struggling with the burden of modern crime and using digital technology in order to make courts more efficient will be a central pillar of our approach to modernisation.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoKoh EweX/Liu HuLiu Hu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamationRights groups and activists are sounding the alarm about the detention of two Chinese investigative journalists after they reportedly exposed corruption by a senior official in Sichuan province.Independent journalists Liu Hu and Wu Yingjiao were taken by police on Sunday after they published their investigation, rights groups say.Critics have long flagged concern about media repression in China, where authorities have arrested and prosecuted journalists, accusing them of causing trouble.Chengdu police said on Monday that two men, identified by their surnames Liu and Wu and aged 50 and 34, were under investigation for \"making false accusations\" and \"illegal business operations\".The Chinese government has yet to comment on the detentions and criticism from rights groups.Liu, a prominent investigative reporter in China, was previously arrested in 2013 on suspicion of defamation after accusing a high-ranking official of corruption.After his release in 2014, he continued his investigations and published his reports on social media.Wu is frequently listed as Liu's collaborator on a public WeChat account where Liu and other journalists post news articles.According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, which is a coalition of Chinese and international activists and groups, Liu had planned to take a train from his home city of Chongqing to the capital Beijing on Sunday when he went missing.Wu was taken by police in Hebei province on the same day, the group said.According to rights groups, the pair's recent report had exposed a county official's alleged corruption.The title of the report - which cannot be found on WeChat any more - had referred to businesses driven to bankruptcy due to the official's actions.Before Liu's arrest this week, he had posted to WeChat several messages he had received from a Chengdu disciplinary inspection official urging him to contact authorities rather than publish reports in the media, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.\"This arrest highlights just how restrictive and hostile China has become toward independent reporting,\" RSF advocacy manager Aleksandra Bielakowska said in a statement.\"We call on the international community to intensify pressure on the Chinese regime, rather than pursue a normalisation of relations that only enables further repression and allows the authorities to continue targeting reliable reporters.\"There are more than 120 journalists detained in China, according to RSF, which calls the country \"the world's biggest jailer of journalists\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA ban on students using mobile phones during the school day has been backed by the House of Lords. A Tory amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill passed with 178 votes to 140, and comes just weeks after opposition peers supported legislation to ban under-16s in the UK from social media platforms.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has previously advised schools that they should be phone-free during school hours, but the guidance lacks legal force.Schools were first given directions on phone use in February 2024, but Phillipson argued it did not go far enough, and updated it last month. The education secretary wrote to heads to make it clear that all schools should be phone-free for the entire day, including breaktimes and lunchtimes.Pressing for the law change, Tory shadow education minister Baroness Barran said: \"We need to reset our own and our children's relationship with smartphones and social media, as smartphones are so often the gateway drug to social media.\"The flexibility inherent in the new guidance from the government is portrayed positively as giving schools and communities discretion to adopt an approach that suits them best, but the reality for many school heads is that it is the exercise of that discretion that's difficult, and it leaves schools facing off against pupils and parents.\"The changes made to the bill will be considered by MPs during the parliamentary tussle known as \"ping-pong\", which sees legislation move between the Commons and Lords until agreement on its wording is reached.As part of the updated guidance, Ofsted will be inspecting schools on the implementation of their mobile phone policies going forward, with the government advising teachers not to use their phones in front of pupils either.The recent debate around teenagers and phones has centred around two main areas: the place for phones in schools, and whether under-16s should be allowed on social media.There are concerns that moving towards a total ban on phone use in schools would bring more challenges.Speaking to the BBC, Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"Many students need them for medical reasons, for travelling to and from school, and they are part of a daily life. \"So what we'd be asking for is a way in which that could be managed, and investment to allow schools to control those situations in a safe and appropriate way.\"But Charlotte Ashton, journalist and co-founder of Generation Focus, says she thinks a statutory ban is needed, to improve consistency between schools.\"What we need with a statutory ban is that every teacher to feel empowered and supported,\" she told BBC Breakfast.\"I struggle to concentrate with my phone in my pocket, let alone a 15-year-old who we're expecting to concentrate through maths.\"",

    "body": "8 hours agoChi Chi IzunduInvestigations correspondentGetty ImagesThames Valley Police says it is assessing allegations, reported by the BBC, that a second woman was sent to the UK by Jeffrey Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.The encounter allegedly occurred at the former prince's residence, Royal Lodge, in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.Her lawyer, Brad Edwards, has previously told BBC News: \"We're talking about at least one woman who was sent by Jeffrey Epstein over to Prince Andrew.\"The BBC asked Mountbatten-Windsor for comment about the allegations when it was first reported, but he is yet to respond, and has previously strongly denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Thames Valley Police said it was \"aware of reports about a woman said to have been taken to an address in Windsor in 2010 for sexual purposes.\"We are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.\"The statement added: \"We take any reports of sexual crimes extremely seriously and encourage anyone with information to come forward.\"At this time, these allegations have not been reported to Thames Valley Police by either the lawyer or their client.\"The anti-monarchist campaign group Republic earlier said it had reported Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor to the police over allegations that \"he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to the UK for sex\".Edwards, whose US law firm has been representing Epstein victims since 2008, said that after spending the night with Mountbatten-Windsor, the woman says she was given tea and a tour of Buckingham Palace.The Palace routinely records the names of tour guests, but it has not been possible for the BBC to corroborate the woman's visit without revealing her identity.Her account of spending the night at Royal Lodge is the first time an Epstein survivor has alleged a sexual encounter occurred at a royal residence.In 2014, the late Virginia Giuffre became the first woman to publicly accuse Mountbatten-Windsor of similar encounters.She alleged that as a 17-year-old she was trafficked by Epstein and his girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, and forced to have sex with Mountbatten-Windsor - a claim he continues to deny.Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in the US against him in 2021, settling the case in February 2022 for an estimated £12m. She took her own life last year.Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor is facing growing criticism over his relationship with Epstein after the latest tranche of files related to the late sex offender.The documents released on Friday included pictures of him kneeling on all fours over a woman lying on the ground, while other files repeatedly reference him. A number of exchanges between Epstein and Mountbatten-Windsor came in the years after the US billionaire pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor.Epstein died in a New York prison cell on 10 August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPatrick JacksonEPAAn American private investigator has told the High Court he \"did unlawful stuff\" in relation to the Duke of Sussex for the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday - but could not \"recall what exactly\".Dan Portley-Hanks supplied a written statement that was given as evidence in support of the legal action being taken by Prince Harry and several other famous figures against the newspapers' publisher Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL).Portley-Hanks said he had worked for ANL titles from the early 1990s until the early 2010s, and is now aged 79.Prince Harry is one of seven high-profile claimants accusing ANL of \"grave breaches of privacy\" over a 20-year period. The publisher has denied wrongdoing.Other claimants in the case include Sir Elton John and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. Both Sir Elton and Baroness Lawrence allege that they were the subjects of unlawful information gathering.Portley-Hanks, who started his statement by explaining he is commonly known as Detective Danno, said he had become a private investigator when he saw an advert offering full training in the profession, just a week after he had been released from prison in 1979.After setting up his own company, he was hired an as in-house private investigator for two US news shows. In the mid-1990s, because he was getting lots of calls from British newspapers, he set up a new enterprise as an \"independent supplier of data to British tabloid reporters\". He said he quickly got \"a lot of work\" from two Mail On Sunday journalists, Caroline Graham and Sharon Churcher.That paper and its sister title became his \"best client and the biggest payer\", he said, and Graham and Churcher \"frequently\" asked him to find phone numbers of people they wished to trace.\"I was the database guy. All I needed was a name or a phone number, and I could find a target's contact and other private details, usually within minutes,\" Portley-Hanks added.In his statement, he explained the work that he had done, on request by the paper, to acquire \"detailed information\" including phone records and contact between celebrity couples. They included Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and singer Nicole Scherzinger, singer Jennifer Lopez and her then-partner Chris Judd, and singer Kylie Minogue and her then-boyfriend Olivier Martinez. Portley-Hanks' statement then named the corresponding Mail on Sunday headlines and articles that appeared in the newspaper within weeks of him providing his information.On Prince Harry, he said: \"I recall that I did stuff for the Mail On Sunday and Daily Mail in relation to Prince Harry. I know that I did unlawful stuff on him but I cannot recall what exactly.\"Churcher, he said, once asked him to send money to a former police officer, which was then used to pay a serving police officer for access to confidential files in relation to Jeffrey Epstein.Portley-Hanks said he had been asked to trace one of the paedophile financier's victims who, he discovered, was called \"Virginia\".At the end of his statement, Portley-Hanks said he was \"coming forward to do the right thing before I die\".\"The digging into the privacy of those people caused a lot of anguish in me.\"In response, Antony White KC, acting for ANL, said in written submissions that the publisher \"strongly\" denied that Prince Harry had been the subject of unlawful information gathering.White said there was an \"inability on the part of the claimants to evidence these so-called confessions\" by Portley-Hanks.\"What has emerged, and continues to emerge, through the drip feed of the claimants' disclosure and Associated's own investigations is a clear picture of purported evidence being obtained through financial inducements and threats,\" he said.\"No specific incidents\" of commissioning private investigators were alleged in relation to Graham, he added.As for the claim that \"corrupt payments\" had been made to a police officer, White said the documents had been sourced by Churcher from \"exhibits placed on the public record\" in civil proceedings involving Epstein.The incident \"provides no evidence of propensity to commission or use the product of unlawful information gathering\", the barrister said.The trial is expected to end in March, with a judgment in writing at a later date.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesAt the Singapore Airshow, the exhibition halls are lined with scale models, mock cockpits, and interactive displays showing the latest commercial jets and aviation technology.One booth is drawing particular attention: Comac, China's state-owned planemaker, which has made significant strides since its C919 passenger jet flew to Singapore in its first trip outside of Chinese territory two years ago.The plane is designed to compete with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX and is increasingly targeting markets beyond China.In its own words \"Comac is setting sights on the Southeast Asian aviation market\".For the company, the airshow is a chance to position itself as a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing in Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, at a time when airlines are grappling with delivery delays and stretched supply chains.\"I think in time, Comac will be a global competitor... but it's going to take them time,\" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told the BBC.\"I think 10 years, 15 years from now, we'll be talking about Boeing, Airbus and Comac... But without question, they will be a considerable player in the future.\"Getty ImagesThe Singapore Airshow is an influential trade show in the Asia Pacific regionThere is certainly a need for another planemaker in Asia Pacific, analysts say.Airlines in the region are feeling the strain from delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, compounded by a shortage of engines and broader supply chain bottlenecks.Uncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions has further complicated challenges for the manufacturing sector, affecting procurement and growth strategy in the region.IATA data shows that global carriers are waiting longer than ever for new aircraft, pushing the average fleet age up and increasing operating costs because older planes are less fuel efficient.Walsh said that Asia Pacific airlines could see double digit growth in 2026 if planes were available. \"It's incredibly frustrating for airlines. The wait between making an order and taking delivery is about seven years,\" he said.This is why Comac is emerging as another option for many Asia Pacific airlines.The company says it has delivered more than 200 C909 and C919 jets, with around a quarter of those planes being operated by airlines in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam. Brunei's GallopAir has placed a large order for the firm's aircraft, and Cambodia is also planning to buy around 20 planes.\"We need more suppliers in the supply chain,\" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). \"The problem with this industry is that the supply chain is an oligopoly and sometimes even a duopoly.\"\"We have been waiting for this for a long time. Comac is a welcome introduction. We need more suppliers in the Asia Pacific especially.\"The company is in a good position with strong government support, and lower prices can make its aircraft appealing to budget airlines in emerging markets.\"In the future we welcome all newcomers. We are keen to see more competition. Comac has got its certification process to go through and at some point in the 2030s, we see that it will be an offering that would be attractive to ourselves and other carriers,\" Mike Szucs, chief executive of low-cost Philippines carrier Cebu Pacific told the BBC.Getty ImagesAirbus is showcasing its flagship A350-1000 high-capacity, long haul passenger jetAs well as expanding in Asia Pacific, Comac is also pursuing European certification, with regulators conducting test flights on its C919. This would allow it to sell to European carriers.However, the road ahead remains long. European certification could take until 2028 or even 2031, regulators say. Meanwhile, harmonising a mix of Chinese and Western parts, flight controls, and software also presents technical challenges for international orders.Maintenance and repair infrastructure is another hurdle, as is pilot training - areas where manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have had infrastructure and systems set up for decades.And in Asia Pacific, Comac has some competition beyond Boeing and Airbus.Brazil's Embraer has carved out a foothold in the region with Singapore budget carrier Scoot, Virgin Australia and Japan's All Nippon Airlines (ANA) placing orders for Embraer jets.Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus still have a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow and the region as a whole. Both manufacturers are signalling to local carriers that aircraft delivery delays, which have frustrated airlines for years, are beginning to improve.\"We are pleased to say that we might be seeing light at the end of tunnel,\" Mike Szucs of Cebu Pacific said.There are questions about Comac's order numbers, too. It has previously said it has more than 1,000 C919 passenger plane orders to Chinese airlines, but only a dozen have been delivered so far. And verifying these order numbers is difficult as Comac is a state-owned Chinese company not a publicly listed one like Boeing or Airbus.Unless Comac can address some or all of these issues, Boeing and Airbus are likely to continue controlling the skies above Asia Pacific.",

    "body": "9 hours agoHarry LowHouse of CommonsBBCKatalin Kaszas says Mark Hehir helped her in a \"very, very scary\" situationA woman whose necklace was stolen by a bus passenger who was then knocked unconscious by the driver has said she is \"extremely grateful\" to him for intervening in what was a \"terrifying\" situation.Katalin Kaszas spoke to BBC London at Parliament earlier on Tuesday, where the driver Mark Hehir - who went on to be sacked over the June 2024 incident - had been invited by shadow justice minister Dr Kieran Mullan.Kaszas described how the thief snatched her necklace as she boarded the 206 bus in north-west London.Hehir, who left the bus to chase the thief, has previously explained that he struck him in an act of self-defence after the thief tried to hit him.'I was screaming'Hehir was dismissed by his employer, Metroline, for gross misconduct, a decision that went on to be upheld at an employment tribunal.Kaszas, who explained how the events unfolded, said she had initially thought the passenger was about to push her off the bus.The 46-year-old said she \"didn't even realise\" her necklace had been snatched from her neck until she looked down.\"Your brain doesn't catch up that quick. You're still trying to understand what's happened,\" Kaszas said.PA MediaKaszas says she is extremely grateful to Hehir, who now works as a barmanShe said after Hehir chased the thief and returned with her necklace, the man then came back towards her.\"I was screaming, telling him to stay away from me,\" Kaszas said, adding: \"His face was bad news. It was very, very scary at that point.\"Kaszas described how Hehir then stepped between her and the man. \"He kept the guy back,\" she said.She added: \"I'm a single mum. I'm the only one my daughter has. If something happens to me, it happens to her.\"He made me feel safe and since there is no Mark on the buses, I don't feel that safe any more because I know the next driver isn't going to step off the bus to protect me because he's going to lose his job.\"PA MediaKieran Mullan (left) introduced Hehir to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch in ParliamentCCTV evidence played at the tribunal showed the thief throwing a punch at Hehir.\"I noticed him making a left swing, so on instinct I retaliated with a right,\" the 62-year-old said.Both Hehir and the passenger were arrested over the altercation, which happened between Wembley and Maida Vale.Hehir, who is originally from County Limerick and now lives in Wembley, was later released and told he would not face further police action.The day after the incident, on 25 June 2024, Hehir was suspended from duty and told to attend an investigation. He was later dismissed. The subsequent employment tribunal heard from the Met Police, which said Hehir's response had been \"proportionate and necessary in the circumstances\".A Metroline spokesperson said: \"The Independent Employment Tribunal has upheld the dismissal as fair. \"The claimant breached protocols designed to keep staff and passengers safe, which is our priority.\"An online petition calling on Metroline to reverse its decision or compensate Hehir has received more than 125,000 signaturesMullan said he was \"shocked\" that Hehir ended up being sacked for \"stepping in\" to prevent a theft. \"That's not good for our society,\" he told BBC London. Justice Secretary David Lammy told the House of Commons on Tuesday that Hehir \"is of course a hero and deserves our support\".He added: \"I'm following this case very closely.\"As for Kaszas, who is from Neasden in north-west London, she said she felt guilty about what happened and had repeatedly apologised to Hehir following the tribunal ruling.\"I know it's not my fault,\" she said, \"but I still feel guilty because I'm in the middle of everything.\"More on this story",

    "body": "10 hours agoIan AikmanUS Navy via ReutersThe drone was \"aggressively\" approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln, a spokesman said (file photo) An Iranian drone was shot down as it \"aggressively approached\" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea on Tuesday, a US military spokesman has said.An F-35C stealth fighter jet which took off from the USS Abraham Lincoln warship shot down the drone \"in self-defence\" to protect the aircraft carrier and its personnel, US Central Command spokesman Capt Tim Hawkins said.The ship was approximately 500 miles from the Iranian coast when the drone approached it with \"unclear intent\".No US equipment was damaged and no service members were harmed.It comes as the US continues to build up a military presence in the region, with tensions high between Washington and Tehran.US President Donald Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if it does not negotiate an agreement to restrict its nuclear programme. Speaking after the downing of the Iranian drone, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that negotiations between the US and Iran are still scheduled for later this week.She said Trump \"remains committed to always pursuing diplomacy first\", but added he \"has always a range of options on the table, and that includes the use of military force\".Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously warned that any attack on the country would spark a \"regional war\".Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's drone incident. In a separate incident on Tuesday, the US military said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) forces had \"harassed a US-flagged, US-crewed merchant vessel\" in the Strait of Hormuz - the world's busiest oil shipping channel.Military support \"de-escalated\" the situation and the tanker proceeded safely, Capt Hawkins said.Also on Tuesday, Leavitt said US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's most senior overseas envoy, will attend the talks on behalf of the White House.US media had previously reported he would meet Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Istanbul on Friday, with the foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also invited.But US news website Axios has since cited two sources as saying Tehran wanted the venue moved to Oman, with only Iranian and US officials present.The US had agreed to this request, the website reported, citing an Arab source. The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Ahead of the planned talks, Washington has repeatedly reminded Tehran of the US strikes on Iran last year, which Trump said had \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear enrichment facilities.He said a fresh attack would be \"far worse\" than those air strikes, which were launched last June during Israel's 12-day war with Iran.The Israeli military also targeted Iran's nuclear facilities and scientists during a short direct conflict, as well as its military commanders and missile arsenal.Tehran responded to the strikes by launching hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. It also carried out a missile attack on a major US air base in Qatar.Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.Last week, Trump told reporters at the White House that Iranian officials \"do want to make a deal\", and that they must commit to \"no nuclear\" and to \"stop killing protesters\". The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has said it has confirmed the killing of 6,424 protesters, 152 children, 214 people associated with the government, and 58 bystanders. It is also investigating reports of another 11,280 deaths.Norway-based Iran Human Rights has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities have acknowledged that at least 3,117 people were killed, but said the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by \"rioters\".The unrest was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living, but it quickly developed into demands for political change.Khamenei described the unrest as \"sedition\" orchestrated by the US and Israel.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesEarlier diagnosis and faster access to treatment is a core part of the government's plan (generic photo)Earlier cancer diagnosis and faster treatment are being promised under a government plan in England to ensure three quarters of patients are surviving cancer for at least five years by 2035.Ministers say the ambition being outlined in their cancer strategy on Wednesday will herald the fastest improvement in cancer outcomes this century.Latest data for 2022 shows five-year survival at 60%, leaving the UK lagging behind other developed countries.To help achieve the goal, the government will pledge to hit the 62-day waiting time target by 2029 - it is more than a decade since it was met.But experts warn it will require significant extra investment, particularly in staff, to make improvement.However, Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who has survived kidney cancer, is adamant the plans are achievable.He said the investment being made in the NHS by the government – the budget is increasing by 3% above inflation in the coming years – coupled with advances in medical science and technology will help \"transform the life chances of cancer patients\".Speaking ahead of publishing the strategy on Wednesday, Streeting added: \"Cancer is more likely to be a death sentence in Britain than other countries around the world. But survival shouldn't come down to who won the lottery of life.\"As a cancer survivor who owes my life to the NHS, I owe it to future patient to make sure they receive the same outstanding care I did.\"Early diagnosis keyImproving early diagnosis is seen as crucial – currently just over half of cancers are diagnosed at stages one and two, which provides the best opportunity to treat the disease. The proportion has improved little in the past decade.Steps to identify more cancers through screening will be outlined – currently only 6% of cases are.The government has already said it will lower the threshold at which bowel cancer screening triggers further checks to help identify more cancers.A targeted lung cancer screening programme is also being rolled out for ex-smokers.The plan is expected to:Deliver 9.5 million more tests and scans by 2029Rapidly increase the amount of precision robotic surgery being carried outTreat more rare cancers, such as brain cancer, in specialist centres in a bid to improve outcomesExpand genetic testing so more patients benefit from targeted treatment, such as immunotherapy, for their specific type of cancerThe pledge to hit the 62-day waiting time target is being seen as particularly challenging. Currently around 70% of patients start their treatment with this timescale, but the target is 85%.There are another two targets that form part of that – a 28-day target for diagnosis, which is being met, and a 31-day target for treatment to start, which is being missed.Staffing shortagesThe Royal College of Radiologists said there were insufficient specialist cancer staff to meet demand.Workforce surveys suggest there is a 30% shortfall in radiologists and 15% in clinical oncologists - doctors that oversee non-surgical cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\"Plans to diagnose and treat cancer faster are welcome, but without sustained investment in the specialist workforce, there will not be enough doctors to deliver timely and effective care for patients,\" added college president Dr Stephen Harden.Cancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell said the promises represented a \"significant commitment\" that would require a \"wide range of measures\".\"England lags behind comparable countries on cancer survival – it's vital that changes,\" she said.Five-year survival data analysed by the charity shows the UK consistently lags behind on cancers of the stomach, colon, pancreas, ovaries and lungs.For example, on colon cancer five-year survival exceeds 70% in Australia, while in the UK it is under 60%.For lung cancer, 15% of UK cases live five years, but in Norway and Canadamore than 20% do.Gemma Peters, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: \"People living with cancer tall us all too often that their care hasn't been good enough, from long waits for tests and treatment to being left without the support they need once treatment ends.\"She said it was encouraging to see such \"bold ambitions\" which had the potential to transform care.",

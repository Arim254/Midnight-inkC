    "body": "1 day agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long-term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large-scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "The Scottish quartet were in command throughout against the Germans, leading 5-2 at the break before accelerating clear, but the hitherto unbeaten Swiss proved more obdurate opposition.Mouat's men led 3-2 at the break - a steal in the third proved the difference - and it took until the seventh end for either side to register a score greater than one.It was the Swiss who did it, to lead 4-3, but it all came down to the last end.Britain needed one to tie, two to win. They had to settle for the former, meaning an extra end. But Switzerland had the hammer and they held their nerve to close out a statement victory.\"On another day we come away with the win,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\"It's going to be tough to beat them but we know we are playing pretty well and it would be exciting to play them again.\"Earlier in the day, Britain's women were unable to repeat their statement win over Canada against the Swedish rink who denied them European gold in November.The unbeaten Swedes raced out to a 7-3 lead at the break - after twice scoring three with the hammer - and stole one in the sixth to take a stranglehold on the game.Rebecca Morrison's rink kept fighting but ultimately fell to a 10-7 defeat to leave their semi-final hopes in the balance.At least four wins will be required from their final five round-robin matches to have any hope of reaching the knockouts.\"It's really hard at this level - it's near-misses and we're a couple of centimetres away from making great shots,\" Morrison told BBC Sport.\"It's frustrating but that's what happens at the Olympics. You need to be at your best and we just weren't quite there.\"The women are back on the ice against Denmark (08:05 GMT) and Switzerland (18:05) on Monday, while the men face Norway (13:05).Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby safely progressed to the final round of the pairs figure skating after recording a season-best score.The duo, who are the first British representatives in this Olympic event since 2014, endured a troubled build-up to the Games after Digby suffered a wrist injury which limited their ability to practice lifts.And in the team event at the start of the Games, Vaipan-Law suffered a fall during their throw triple Salchow, meaning there were worries about whether they would finish in the top 16 of the short program – needed to qualify for the free skate.But they assuaged those doubts with a slick routine as Vaipan-Law landed the throw well before their final spin was synchronised perfectly.Digby was grinning even before their routine concluded, and was proven right as they scored 66.07, their highest score of the 2025-26 season.\"That little celebration at the end was me releasing all the emotion of it going exactly as I wanted it to,\" Vaipan-Law told the BBC.They qualify in 13th place, meaning they will perform fourth in the free skate tomorrow – and will aim to better their best World Championship finish of 12th.\"Seeing so many British flags, that energy gave us a little extra,\" said Digby. \"We kept our heads and we were nice and calm. A clean skate, we couldn't ask for any more at the Olympics.\"Germany's Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin, who last year won world silver, lead at the half-way point with a score of 80.01.European champions Anastasia Metelkina and Luka Berulava are second as they aim to win a first-ever Winter Olympic medal for Georgia, while Canada's Lia Pereira and Trennt Michaud are currently in bronze position.",

    "body": "Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu, 2026 slopestyle gold medallist Mathilde Gremaud and Canada's Megan Oldham. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "12 minutes agoAlex ForsythPolitical correspondentReutersThe government is aware it can't afford to get SEND reforms wrongIn the next few weeks, the government is expected to outline its plan to overhaul the crucial yet complex system of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) in England - and it could prove contentious.The SEND system is vital to hundreds of thousands of parents and children in England.Almost every MP will tell you it's an issue that regularly tops their inboxes; last month, the prime minister acknowledged SEND was probably raised with him more than any other topic in the House of Commons.Given the strength of feeling, it's perhaps no surprise that some Labour MPs have been nervous about what the government is planning, mindful of previous missteps on issues of public concern like winter fuel payments and welfare.With the prime minister's authority and judgement having been openly questioned by some in his own party in recent days, it's even more crucial for the government that they get this right.And SEND reform is an issue fraught with potential pitfalls.PA MediaStrength of feeling among parents runs high and MPs warn of an erosion of trust in the SEND system\"The problem is there's such a huge trust deficit between parents and government on this issue,\" one Labour backbencher said.\"They know the current system doesn't work, but they worry a new system won't make it better and might make it worse and there's not enough trust in the bank to be able to trade on that.\"Few would dispute the need to reform the SEND system. In recent years demand has spiralled upwards, with a record one in five children in England now requiring support.Many parents find themselves facing a system under strain, with provision patchy and families often locked in lengthy legal battles to get support for their children.Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that spending on special educational needs and disabilities will have more than doubled in real terms by 2028–29 as compared with 2015–16, and councils have been racking up debts as the cost of support outstrips budgets, leading to warnings of a \"total system collapse\".Sources close to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson say she is prepared to \"grasp the nettle\" and take the difficult but necessary decisions, driven by the belief that reform is essential to provide children with the support they need.But the government has been treading carefully. The schools white paper setting out SEND reforms was delayed last year, with ministers taking time to engage in a series of \"listening exercises\" with parents and professionals in the sector.The thinking within government is clear. Ministers favour inclusive mainstream education for more children with special educational needs, where from the early years they get the support they require within local mainstream schools, with specialist school places for those with complex needs.A series of recent announcements have been described as a \"downpayment\" on the government's approach and commitment to funding; in December, there was £3bn to create places for children with SEND in mainstream schools, followed this year by £200m to train teachers in supporting children with SEND and £1bn to create suitable spaces in mainstream school buildings.The government has also agreed to clear £5bn worth of debts that councils have built up, and take on responsibility for SEND funding from 2028.One backbench Labour MP said they were \"reassured\" by the announcements so far. \"It builds my confidence in the fact they're serious about what needs to be done at the get go on this,\" they said.But they said they were still waiting and watching for the detail of the government's wider plan.A potential flashpoint is what the government decides to do regarding Education Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) – the legal documents that underpin a child's right to support.Official government figures show the number of these plans increased by 166% between January 2015 and January 2025, from 240,000 to 639,000.There is a school of thought – articulated by parliament's education select committee in a report last year – that providing the support children need from the earliest stages in mainstream school settings will mean fewer parents need to go down the often difficult and adversarial route of pursuing an EHCP to access help.But MPs are aware that parents fear any erosion of legal rights, with an active campaign underway called Save Our Children's Rights petitioning the government.\"I think probably the key is if a parent can stand up and demonstrate they and their child have got fewer rights today than they had yesterday, that'll be the killer blow,\" said one Labour backbencher.\"This is where the trust problem comes. I can tell you we're going to put loads of support into mainstream and then it will get better, the trouble is we've lost so much trust and confidence with the public – not just this Labour government but the whole SEND system.\"The government has insisted current support and legal entitlements will not be removed, but has not ruled out future changes to the system.There are Labour MPs who feel encouraged, with one describing \"thoughtful thinking\" that is taking place in government.But even among those who are optimistic there is caution, given the complexity and scale of the issue, with repeated warnings that the government has to \"keep engaging\" with parents and people working in the sector.Some argue the government needs to go further. The County Councils Network has warned the government not to \"duck\" reforms, saying in order to improve outcomes for children, costs have to be \"tackled and curtailed\" and there should be legislative change to focus EHCPs on those most in need.Every party in Westminster has acknowledged the need to reform England's SEND system.The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.The Liberal Democrats have outlined fundamental principles including a \"fair funding system\" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils, while Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy after the party's deputy leader, Richard Tice, said some parents were \"abusing the system\" – limiting the support for those \"genuinely in need\".The challenge for the government is delivering reforms bold enough to improve a system under enormous strain without alienating parents or leading to a backlash from its own MPs – all within constrained budgets. It's no wonder they're treading carefully.",

    "body": "6 hours agoMax MatzaTwitter/@DeptofWarFootage posted by the Pentagon appears to show troops boarding the tankerThe US military has boarded a second oil tanker in the Indian Ocean, after tracking it from the Caribbean Sea where it was suspected of helping Venezuela avoid US sanctions. The boarding of the Panamanian-flagged Veronica III is the second such US interception in the Indian Ocean in the past week. It comes amid a US crackdown on sanctioned oil exports from Venezuela. \"Distance does not protect you,\" the Pentagon said in a statement, alongside video and photos which appear to show the US raid.At least seven oil tankers have been seized by the US since last year, as the Trump administration moves to control the supply of Venezuelan oil.The Pentagon statement on Sunday defined the operation as \"a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding\". The statement did not say whether the US had seized the vessel, or allowed it to continue on its journey.\"The vessel tried to defy President Trump's quarantine - hoping to slip away,\" the Pentagon statement said. \"We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.\"No other nation has the reach, endurance, or will to do this. International waters are not sanctuary. By land, air, or sea, we will find you and deliver justice.\"The Veronica III is currently under sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department. The Veronica III departed Venezuela on 3 January, according to monitoring group TankerTrackers.com - the same day that the US captured Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in a raid on his presidential compound in CaracasThe ship was carrying 1.9 million barrels of crude oil at the time of departure, the group says, adding that it is believed to have been involved in the transport of Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil since 2023.Twitter/@DeptofWarIn December, US President Donald Trump said that he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, a move the Venezuelan government at the time described as \"theft\".The US blockade has sharply curtailed Venezuelan oil exports, with only ships associated with Chevron and bound for the US operating as usual.Loadings had fallen roughly by half in January to about 400,000 barrels per day, Matt Smith, head of US analysis at analytics firm Kpler, told the BBC last month.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven people were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five. The Israel Defense Forces said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of the ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.Gaza's Civil Defence said 11 people had been killed in the strikes, while staff at the Al-Shifa hospital said a 12th person was killed in an exchange of gunfire, separate from the air strikes.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which is due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.Ahead of the talks, Trump said on Sunday that members of the board had pledged $5bn (£3.6bn) to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.In a post on his Truth Social platform, he also repeated calls for Hamas to move forward with disarmament. Hamas has previously rejected disarmament, saying it would only do so once a Palestinian state had been established.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

    "body": "9 hours agoAsha PatelEast MidlandsBBCPolice said the man entered the water near the junction of Main Street and Ash Grove Lane in Egginton, DerbyshireA man has died after he entered a flooded brook during a police chase.Officers had been pursuing a vehicle towing a caravan, which was believed to have been stolen from the village of Oakerthorpe in Derbyshire, in the early hours of Saturday, Derbyshire Police said.The force said after ramming police cars and eventually coming to a stop near Egginton, two men fled the vehicle and one man was arrested, while the second man entered Egginton Brook - which was flooded.The man was recovered from the water after several hours and taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The force said it had referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).Damage has been caused to a wall on the bridge at the junction of Ash Grove Lane and Main Street Formal identification of the man who died has not yet taken place and police said efforts were ongoing to trace his next of kin. He had entered the water near the junction of Main Street and Ash Grove Lane, according to the force, which led to \"extensive searches\" involving Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. The man was treated by ambulance crews at the scene before he was taken to hospital. From the scene, BBC correspondent Jeremy Ball said: \"Smashed brickwork from the bridge over Egginton Brook lies in the water, below a broken 'Welcome to the village of Egginton' sign. \"One villager told me the road was closed until a wrecked car was removed from the bridge.\"Adrian Osiecki, 34, from Harnall Lane West in Coventry, has been charged with dangerous driving - including failing to stop for police and criminal damage to police vehicles - driving without insurance, driving while disqualified and theft of a caravan.He is due to appear at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Monday.

    "body": "17 minutes agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesDame Antonia Romeo has held senior roles at the Department for International Trade, the Ministry of Justice and the Home OfficeThe frontrunner to become the country's most senior civil servant was spoken to about her management and leadership style after an inquiry into a complaint against her.Dame Antonia Romeo, understood to be the government's favoured candidate for cabinet secretary, was investigated over three allegations when she worked in New York in 2017.The outcome of that investigation was \"there is no case to answer\", Dame Antonia was told in a letter seen by BBC News. But a source said she faced \"tough conversations\" about her leadership style.A Cabinet Office spokesperson emphasised that it was a single complaint that was dismissed, and said Dame Antonia has a long \"record of excellent public service\".A source said that \"there were some issues of personal style that grated with people.\"\"That was not an easy conversation. She took her medicine,\" they said, but they added there had been a thorough investigation and nothing of substance was upheld.The three allegations came from a single complaint and were related to her use of expenses and accusations of bullying when she was the government's consul-general in New York, the BBC understands.In a letter seen by BBC News outlining the outcome of the investigation Rupert McNeil, then the government chief people officer, told Dame Antonia \"there is no case to answer\".McNeil added in the letter from March 2017: \"I appreciate processes of this type are always distressing, but as discussed, they are rich sources of feedback about management and leadership style.\"I know from our conversation that you are very alert to this, and this process has given you rich insight.\"The letter, marked \"official - sensitive\", was shared with Jeremy Heywood, the then-cabinet secretary, John Manzoni, the then-permanent secretary at the Cabinet Office, Kim Darroch, then-British ambassador to the US, the HR directors at the foreign office and cabinet office, and Simon McDonald, now Lord McDonald, who was then-head of the foreign office.Lord McDonald made a highly unusual intervention this week, saying he had tried to get in touch with No10 about the possibility of Dame Antonia being appointed and warning \"more due diligence\" was needed.\"The due diligence needs to be thorough. If the candidate mentioned in the media is the one, in my view, the due diligence has some way still to go,\" he told Channel 4 News.Others in government defended Dame Antonia vociferously, accusing Lord McDonald of a \"disgusting\" and \"hugely irresponsible\" attack on her.One official who has worked with her recently described her as \"the most inspiring leader in the civil service\".\"There are people right from the very top to the most junior staff who are outraged and completely baffled. Not only that it's an attack on a civil servant who can't defend themselves, but also that it is not remotely true.\"People follow her and want to work with her.\"Another official who spoke to the BBC stressed that in the nine years since the investigation, the civil servant had led three government departments with a combined staff of around 150,000 people and not received a single complaint.Sir Matthew Rycroft, who was UK Permanent Representative to the UN at the time Romeo was in New York in 2017, said: \"The decision maker was the CEO of the Civil Service. He concluded that there was no case to answer, and he reported this to the Cabinet Secretary who agreed.\"I was the senior FCDO official in New York at the time, and having seen the relevant documentation myself, I can confirm that I too was satisfied there was no case to answer in relation to the single formal complaint that was made.\"Rupert McNeil, the head of HR for the British Government at the time, said: \"As the head of the Civil Service Human Resources function at the time, I can confirm the investigation into the one formal complaint against Antonia nine years ago was done thoroughly and independently – and it concluded there was no case to answer.\"The smears being thrown against her are reprehensible and hypocritical. They undermine every investigation that the civil service has run.\"Former officials making these entirely inappropriate remarks were actively part of the governance of civil service processes and so it is astonishing that they feel they can make comments now which they never made to me at the time.\"She is an excellent public servant who has served governments of all stripes with diligence and respect.\"A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: ⁠\"As we have repeatedly made clear, one formal complaint was raised nine years ago and the allegations were dismissed on the basis that there was no case to answer. This letter confirms that is the case.\"Antonia Romeo is an outstanding leader with a 25-year record of excellent public service.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoFiona NimoniandParham Ghobadi,BBC PersianAFP via Getty ImagesPolice in Munich estimated that 250,000 turned out to hear Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's former leader, give an addressHundreds of thousands of people took part in demonstrations around the world against the Iranian government on Saturday, following calls from the exiled son of the late shah for a \"global day of action\".Addressing an estimated 250,000 people in Munich, Reza Pahlavi - who has called for the overthrow of Iran's Islamic regime - denounced a crackdown on recent protests there.Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto saw the largest crowds, with smaller protests in cities including Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.Activists say more than 6,000 people were killed after joining nationwide protests in Iran against the rising cost of living and the government. Thousands more deaths are being investigated.Pahlavi told the crowd: \"My first message is to our brave and fighting compatriots inside the country: know that you are not alone, and today the world stands with you in this struggle.\"Criticising Iran's leadership, he said: \"In contrast to this corrupt, repressive, child-killing regime, you represent a great culture and civilisation, and in a free Iran of tomorrow you will prove to the world what a great nation we are.\"EPAReza Pahlavi and his wife Yasmine Pahlavi in Munich on Saturday Pahlavi's daughter, Noor Pahlavi, addressed a crowd in Los Angeles. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported her as saying Iranians had \"never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime\". She called on US President Donald Trump to end ongoing nuclear talks with Iran's leadership, describing it as \"negotiation with murderers\". On Friday, Trump told reporters a change in Iran's government would be the \"best thing that could happen\", though it was unclear whether his comments were in reference to Pahlavi, who is seeking a role in Iran. Trump told news agency Reuters last month that Pahlavi seemed \"very nice\" but expressed uncertainty over whether he could muster enough support within Iran to eventually lead it.Andolu via Getty ImagesThe largest rally was held in Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 people turned out to protestLightRocket via Getty ImagesPeople gathered to protest across the world, including in LondonIn Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 joined a demonstration, participants told BBC Persian they were there to speak out on behalf of friends and family inside Iran.Street protests broke out in Iran on 28 December, initially sparked by economic turmoil and fuelled by long-running discontent with the country's leaders.Demonstrations spread to more than 100 cities and towns across all of Iran's provinces. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has confirmed the deaths of 6,872 protesters, including more than 150 children.Many demonstrators in Iran have chanted Pahlavi's name and called for his return to political leadership.Groomed from birth to inherit the throne, Pahlavi was 18 years old when the 1979 Islamic revolution swept away his father's monarchy.Almost 50 years later, Pahlavi is once again seeking to shape his country's future.But critics question whether his vision for Iran would ultimately lead to a democracy.More on this story ",

    "body": "4 hours agoGrace Eliza GoodwinGetty ImagesThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has said it has released all of the files required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers have argued the release is insufficient.The letter sent to members of the US Congress on Saturday from Pam Bondi and Todd Blanche said all documents in the possession of the DoJ had been released and provided a list of names contained in the files.Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who co-wrote the law, called for the DoJ to also release internal memos outlining past decisions on whether to charge Epstein and his associates.Millions of new files relating to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were released by the DoJ earlier this month.In the letter, Attorney General Bondi and her deputy Blanche wrote: \"In accordance with the requirements of the Act, and as described in various Department submissions to the courts of the Southern District of New York assigned to the Epstein and Maxwell prosecutions and related orders, the Department released all 'records, documents, communications and investigative materials in the possession of the Department' that 'relate to' any of nine different categories.\"No records were withheld from the DoJ's release \"on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity\", the letter added. The individuals listed in the letter include people who \"are or were a government official or politically exposed person\", and whose name appeared at least once in the files, the letter says. The names appear in the files in a \"wide variety of contexts\", including some people who had \"extensive direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell\" and others who were merely referenced in documents or news articles contained in the files, Blanche and Bondi wrote. Getty ImagesLawmakers Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are calling for justice department to release more Epstein filesDonald Trump, Bill Gates, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and Bill Clinton - who are included in the list - all had documented past relationships with Epstein and Maxwell. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing and each has denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes. But the list also includes the names of deceased musicians Janis Joplin and Elvis Presley. The letter was addressed to the Senate Judiciary Committee's chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking member Dick Durbin, as well as the House Judiciary Committee's chairman Jim Jordan and ranking member Jamie Raskin.In an interview on ABC This Week on Sunday, Massie argued that, even though the DoJ \"wants to say they are done with this document production\", there are more crucial files that should be released. The DoJ was \"signing deliberative process privilege in order not to release some of the documents\", he said.\"The problem with that is the bill that Ro Khanna and I wrote says that they must release internal memos and notes and emails about their decisions on whether to prosecute or not prosecute, whether to investigate or not investigate.\"In response to the letter, California Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, who co-wrote the Epstein Files Transparency Act, accused the DoJ of \"purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email\".\"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,\" Khanna wrote on X on Saturday. \"Release the full files,\" he added. \"Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names.\"The BBC has contacted the Department of Justice for comment. US lawmakers previously said files on Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release, leading to at least one document being unredacted after their criticism. Lawyers for Epstein's victims have also said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified. At the time, the DoJ said mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\" and they had taken down all the flagged files. ",

Amazon said it was \"aware\" of the situation and was \"investigating\".Your SouthendThe route, said to be 600 years old and covering six miles (10km), is managed by Essex Highways. Qinetiq - a global defence and security company which manages the firing range - describes the path as a \"unique right of way which requires both caution and specialist knowledge to negotiate safely\". The full route is not suitable for vehicles, and people are advised to only walk there accompanied by a guide who knows the mudflats.According to parish council records, 100 people have died on The Broomway, with the last known death in 1919.Jodie Halford/BBCThe vehicle is expected to be removed from The Broomway on Sunday afternoonThe coastguard said it had spoken to a Qinetiq security officer who said the incident had taken place on Saturday evening and that the driver had \"removed themselves from the van and reported the incident to Amazon\". It said the vehicle had already been there during high tide and that, alongside a farmer, Amazon arranged to remove the vehicle on Sunday. Coastguard officers were stood down from the incident after the occupants of the van were confirmed to be safe and the vehicle was due to be removed. More on this storyRelated internet links",

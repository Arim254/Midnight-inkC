    "body": "As the world inches back to a pre-WW2 order, the 'middle powers' face a grave new challenge16 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCI had been asked to give a keynote speech at a conference at Columbia University's Journalism School. It was January 2002. Two planes had been flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center months earlier and you could still feel how wounded the city felt. You could read it in the faces of New Yorkers you spoke to.In my speech I made a few opening remarks about what the United States had meant to me. \"I was born 15 years after the Second World War,\" I said, \"in a world America made. The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement.\"American military might had won the war in the West, I continued. It had stopped the further westward expansion of Soviet power.I talked briefly about the transformational effect of the Marshall Plan, through which the US had given Europe the means to rebuild its shattered economies, and to re-establish the institutions of democracy.AFP via Getty Images'I was born 15 years after the Second World War in a world America made,' Allan Little told an audience. 'The peace and security and increasing prosperity of the Western Europe that I was born into was in large part an American achievement'I told the audience, composed mostly of students of journalism, that as a young reporter I had myself witnessed the inspiring culmination of all this in 1989 when I'd stood in Wenceslas Square in Prague. Back then I'd watched, awestruck, as Czechs and Slovaks demanded an end to Soviet occupation, and to a hated Communist dictatorship, so that they too could be part of the community of nations that we called, simply, \"the West\", bound together by shared values, at the head of which sat the the United States of America.I looked up from my notes at the faces of the audience. Near the front of the lecture hall sat a young man. He looked about 20. Tears were running down his face and he was quietly trying to suppress a sob.At a drinks reception afterwards he approached me. \"I'm sorry I lost it in there,\" he said. \"Your words: right now we are feeling raw and vulnerable. America needs to hear this stuff from its foreign friends.\"In that moment I thought how lucky my generation - and his - had been, to be alive in an era in which the international system was regulated by rules - a world that had turned its back on the unconstrained power of the Great Powers.Getty ImagesDonald Trump believes the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too longBut it was the words of one of his classmates that come back to me now. He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.ReutersCanada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" that young Pakistani student admitted all those years ago. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient. That trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. And we knew that international law applied with varying rigour depending on the identity of the accused or victim.\"\"Don't you find it interesting,\" he asked, \"that the US, the country that came into existence in a revolt against the arbitrary exercise of [British] power is, in our day, the most powerful exponent of arbitrary power?\"A new world order or back to the future?Donald Trump came to Davos last week clearly determined to bend the Europeans to his will over Greenland. He wanted ownership, he said.He declared that Denmark had only \"added one more dog sled\" to defend the territory. That speaks volumes to the undisguised contempt with which he and many in his inner circle appear to hold certain European allies.\"I fully share your loathing of European freeloading,\" Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told a group on messaging app Signal that included Vice-President JD Vance last year, adding \"PATHETIC\". (He hadn't realised that the Editor of The Atlantic magazine had apparently been added to the group chat.)Then President Trump himself told Fox News recently that, during the war in Afghanistan, Nato had sent \"some troops\" but that they had \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines\".The comments provoked anger among UK politicians and veterans' families. The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded Trump's remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The UK prime minister spoke to Trump on Saturday, after which the US president used his Truth Social platform to praise UK troops as being \"among the greatest of all warriors\".Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesSir Keir Starmer said US President Donald Trump's remarks about Nato troops in Afghanistan were 'insulting and frankly appalling'We know from the White House's National Security Strategy, published in December, that in his second term, Trump intends to unshackle the US from the system of transnational bodies created, in part by Washington, to regulate international affairs. That document spells out the means by which the US will put \"America First\" at the heart of US security strategy by using whatever powers they have - ranging from economic sanctions and trade tariffs to military intervention - to bend smaller and weaker nations into alignment with US interests.It is a strategy which privileges strength - a return to a world in which the Great Powers carve out spheres of influence.The danger in this for what Canada's prime minister called \"the middle powers\" is clear. \"If you're not at the table,\" he said, \"you're on the menu.\"Re-interpretation of the Monroe DoctrineIn Davos last week, America's allies, especially Canada and Europe, were laying to rest what is now commonly called the rules-based intentional order, and in some cases mourning its demise.But, as the young Pakistani student at Columbia journalism school argued all those years ago, to large parts of the rest of the world it has not seemed, in the last 80 years, that the US, and on occasions some of its friends, felt restrained by rules.More from InDepth\"After World War Two, we saw, under the so-called rules-based international order multiple interventions by the United States in Latin America,\" says Dr Christopher Sabatini, Senior Research Fellow for Latin America at Chatham House think tank in London.\"It's not new. There are patterns of intervention that go all the way back to 1823. There's a term I use for American policymakers who advocate for unilateral US intervention. I call them \"backyard-istas\" - those who see Latin America as their backyard.\"In 1953, the CIA, assisted by the British Secret Intelligence Services, orchestrated a coup that overthrew the government of Mohammad Mossadeq in Iran. He had wanted to audit the books of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later part of BP), and when it refused to co-operate, Mossadeq threatened to nationalise it.For posing a threat to British economic interests, he was overthrown and Britain and the US threw their weight behind the increasingly dictatorial shah.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesThe CIA played a key role in the 1953 coup which ousted Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister, Mohammad MossadeqAt the same time, the US was conspiring to overthrow the elected government of Guatemala, which had implemented an ambitious programme of land reform that threatened to harm the profitability of the American United Fruit Company. Again with active CIA collusion, the left-wing President Jacobo Arbenz was toppled and replaced by a series of US-backed authoritarian rulers.In 1983 the US invaded the Caribbean island of Grenada, after a Marxist coup. This was a country of which the late Queen, Elizabeth II, was head of state.And the US invaded Panama in 1989, and arrested the military leader Manuel Noriega. He spent all but the last few months of his life in prison.These interventions were all functions of the Monroe Doctrine, first promulgated by President James Monroe in 1823. It asserted America's right to dominate the Western hemisphere and keep European powers from trying to meddle in the newly independent states of Latin America. The post-war rules-based international order did not deter the US from imposing its will on weaker neighbours.Getty Images / CorbisPanama's leader Manuel Noriega was forcibly removed by US troops in 1989 and spent almost all of the rest of his life in jailWhen it was announced by the fifth president of the US, James Monroe, the doctrine that bears his name was widely seen as an expression of US solidarity with its neighbours, a strategy to protect them from attempts by the European great powers to recolonise them. The US, after all, shared with them a set of republican values and a history of anti-colonial struggle.But the doctrine quickly became an assertion of Washington's right to dominate its neighbours and use any means, up to and including military intervention, to bend their policies into alignment with American interests. President Theodore Roosevelt, in 1904, said it gave the US \"international police power\" to intervene in countries where there was \"wrongdoing\".So could it be that President Trump's re-interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine is simply part of a continuum in US foreign policy?Getty ImagesThe Monroe Doctrine was first promulgated by US President James Monroe (pictured) in 1823\"The Guatemala coup, in 1954 - that was entirely owned by the US. They orchestrated the entire takeover of the country,\" says Christopher Sabatini.The 1973 coup in Chile against left-wing Prime Minister Salvador Allende \"wasn't orchestrated by the CIA but the United States said it would accept a coup\", he added.During the Cold War, the main motivation for intervention was the perception that Soviet-backed parties were gaining ground domestically, representing Communist advances into the Western hemisphere. In our own day, the perceived enemy is no longer Communism, but drug-trafficking and migration.That difference aside, President Trump's reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine \"absolutely is 'back to the future',\" says the historian Jay Sexton, author of The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth Century America.Getty ImagesGuatamalan President Jacobo Arbenz was overthrown by a US-backed coup in 1954\"The other thing that gives Trump's United States a 19th-Century feel is his unpredictability, his volatility. Observers could never really predict what the US would do next.\"We don't know what the future holds but we do known from even a cursory look at modern history, from 1815 onwards [the end of the Napoleonic wars], that Great Power rivalries are really destabilising. They lead to conflict.\"Cohesion among the alliesAmerican unilateralism may not be new. What is new is that this time, it is America's friends and allies that find themselves on the receiving end of American power.Suddenly, Europeans and Canadians are getting a taste of something long familiar to other parts of the world - that arbitrary exercise of US power that the young Pakistani journalism student articulated so clearly to me in the weeks after 9/11.For the first year of his second term, European leaders used flattery in their approach to Trump. Starmer, for example, had King Charles invite him to make a second state visit to the UK, an honour no other US president in history has been granted. The Secretary-General of Nato, Mark Rutte, referred to him, bizarrely, as \"daddy\".Getty ImagesKing Charles invited Donald Trump to make a second state visit to the UK - an honour no other US president has received (photo from first state visit in 2019)But Trump's approach towards Europe brought him clear success. Previous presidents, including Barack Obama and Joe Biden, also believed European allies were not pulling their weight in Nato - the collective trans-Atlantic defence alliance - and wanted them to spend more on their own security. Only Trump succeeded in making them act. In response to his threats, they agreed to raise their defence spending from around 2% of GDP to 5%, something unthinkable even a year ago.Greenland, however, seems to have been a game-changer. When Trump threatened Danish sovereignty in Greenland, the allies began to cohere around a new-found defiance, and resolved not, this time, to bend.Canada's prime minister gave voice to this moment. In his pivotal speech in Davos Mark Carney said this was a moment of \"rupture\" with the old rules-based international order - in the new world of Great Power politics, \"the middle powers\" needed to act together.Getty ImagesPrevious US presidents had also believed the European allies should spend more on their own security - only Trump succeeded in making them actIt is rare, at Davos, for an audience to rise to its feet and award a speaker with a standing ovation. But they did it for Carney, and you felt, in that moment, a cohesion forming among the allies.And in an instant, the threat of tariffs lifted. Trump has gained nothing over Greenland that the US hasn't already had for decades - the right, with Denmark's blessing, to build military bases, stage unlimited personnel there, and even to mineral exploitation.The challenge facing 'middle powers' todayThere is no doubt that Trump's America-First strategy is popular with his Maga base. They share his view that the free world has been freeloading on American largesse for too long. And European leaders, in agreeing to increase their defence spending, have accepted that President Trump was right: that the imbalance was no longer fair or sustainable.ReutersIn June 2004 I reported on the celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy. There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth. We watched them go one by one or in little groups to the cemeteries to find the graves of the young men they'd known and whom they'd left behind in the soil of liberated France.We watched the allied heads of government pay tribute to those old men. But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to. They wanted no going back to that.ShutterstockThe world the veterans bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents, writes Allan LittleThose born in the decades after the war may have made the mistake of believing that the world could never go back to that.And 24 years ago, as I gave my talk in a New York City still traumatised by 9/11, did I, too, make the mistake of thinking the post-World War Two order, underpinned, as it was, by American might, was the new permanent normal? I think I did.For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes. It has been corroding not just in the US but across the Western world for decades now. As such Trump may be a symptom, not a cause, of Carney's \"rupture\" with the post-World War Two order.Watching those old men making their way through the Normandy cemeteries was a graphic and poignant reminder that democracy, the rule of law, accountable government are not naturally occurring phenomena.  They are not even, historically speaking, normal. They have to be fought for, built, sustained, defended.And that is the challenge from here facing what Mark Carney called \"the middle powers\".Top picture credit: AFP/ReutersBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoOttilie MitchellPA MediaA group of 86 protesters who allegedly breached prison grounds at west London's Wormwood Scrubs jail have been arrested, the Metropolitan Police said.The force said the group were \"protesting in support of a Palestine Action prisoner on a hunger strike\", and allegedly threatened police and stopped prison staff from entering and exiting.The Prisoners for Palestine campaign group identified the inmate as Muhammad Umer Khalid, 22, who they say began a thirst strike on Friday. He is awaiting trial over a break-in at RAF Brize Norton last June. He denies the charges.All those involved will be arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass after refusing to leave.\"A number managed to get inside a staff entrance area of a prison building,\" the Met said.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that \"at no point was prison security compromised\" and called the action an \"escalation\" that was \"completely unacceptable\".\"While we support the right to peacefully protest, reports of trespassing and threats being made to staff and police officers are deeply concerning,\" they said.Prisoners for Palestine accused the police of carrying out a \"violent and wildly disproportionate response\" to the protest.The group said Khalid has limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a genetic condition, and was on an \"extremely dangerous\" thirst strike.Related storiesMore from the BBC",

    "body": "I jumped out of a plane at 5,000ft - what happened next changed my life forever9 hours agoRachael DavisPress AssociationCollect/PA Real LifeRob has \"absolutely no memory\" of the accidentAn RAF veteran has said his life changed forever after he fell nearly 1,000ft (304m) during a training session which went wrong.Rob Bugden, 40, jumped from a plane at 5,000ft (1,524m) in January 2016 as part of a parachuting exercise, when he collided mid-air with his teammate.The next thing he remembers is waking up in hospital to discover that the collision had caused him to plummet to the ground, and left him paralysed from the neck down.\"I have absolutely no memory of it, and you know what? I'm alright with that,\" said Rob, speaking 10 years after the accident.Rob, from the Vale of Glamorgan, joined the RAF in 2008 as a physical training instructor, before deciding to specialise as a parachute jumping instructor in 2015.The following year, he took part in a training jump in formation with six other parachutists. \"That day, I walked down the aircraft – it's the last time I'm ever going to walk, which is really weird when you think about it,\" he said.Collect/PA Real LifeRob was a parachute jumping instructor for the RAFHe said the jump initially went \"really well\" - \"[but] then I woke up in a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona\".Rob was told that during the dive, while in the sky at about 1,000ft, there was a collision.\"That collision breaks my neck,\" he said.\"The canopies collapse, and we fall roughly about 900ft. Fortunately for us, we landed on sand, and I, unfortunately, came off second best.\"The other man involved in the collision was Rob's friend. While Rob was knocked unconscious – \"which is quite lucky in lots of ways, probably may well have saved my life\" – his friend remained conscious but broke his tibia and fibula and tore his kidney.\"But more than that, he remembers everything,\" Rob said. He added there were some \"very talented gentlemen on the ground\", including UK special forces who were doing an exercise in the same place.After witnessing the collision, they went to help straight away.\"Without them, I don't think I'd be alive,\" Rob reflected.\"So thank you to all of them. It seems such a frivolous word, but yeah, what else can I say?\"RAF Benevolent Fund/PA Real LifeRob says he is \"so thankful\" to have wonderful family and friendsRob had several operations in the US including a tracheostomy, as he could not breathe by himself, a peg in his stomach to feed him, and a pacemaker fitted. He also had his eye socket put back together, and fixations in his neck.By this point Rob was completely paralysed but \"in and out of consciousness all the time\" due to heavy medication, so does not remember \"a great deal\". After around three weeks, he was brought back to the UK and admitted to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, where \"the long journey began\".It was here that Rob said the reality hit him that he \"couldn't move\".\"We were a bit of a mess,\" said Rob.He learned his spinal cord had been severely crushed and that he was quadriplegic.\"Basically, all four of my limbs don't work,\" he explained.It took Rob a long time to get his head around how different his life would be.But he added: \"I'm very stubborn. I think I'm always right, but actually, flipping that on its head, it also meant that I was not going to give up.\"Eventually, Rob was able to breathe by himself and then started getting some movement back in his shoulders. After a year he could feed himself.\"Even then, I was getting most on my T-shirt, but it didn't matter, because I was doing it myself,\" he said.The next step was limiting the amount of help he needed for things such as using the toilet, and after two years he was able to flip his catheter himself, which felt like a big step.'So thankful, so grateful'Today, Rob requires round-the-clock live-in care, but he is able to take part in hobbies such as going to the gym, hanging out with his dog Denzel, and going to the pub with his friends.Rob affectionately calls Denzel his \"lack of assistance dog, because he is useless\".\"If there's chicken around, that's it. He's not going to listen,\" he laughed.\"But actually, I'm completely and utterly lost without him. He's my best friend. He is my companion, he's my protector. He's allowed me to make new friends and get out and about.\"During his long recovery and beyond, Rob received support from the RAF Benevolent Fund, a charity which supports serving and former RAF personnel and their families.Rob had just bought his first flat before his accident but was not able to return there as he needed a specialised, adapted home, so the fund's housing trust bought and adapted a home for Rob.\"I've got full access to the house with wet rooms, I've got two hoists – one in my bedroom, one in my living room, so I can get on my sofa. And I live next door to a pub, which is very handy,\" he said. Rob has left the RAF and adapted to a completely different way of life, but said he was \"so thankful, so grateful\" to have a wonderful group of friends and family rallying around him to make sure he is never alone.More top stories",

    "body": "3 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondent, Nyaungshwe, Shan state andJosh CheethamPolls in Myanmar have closed after a third and final stage of voting in what are widely viewed as sham elections.Many popular parties are banned from standing and voting has not been possible in large areas of the country because of a five-year-long civil war.The dominant party backed by the ruling military junta is expected to win a landslide victory.The current regime has rejected international criticism of the election, maintaining that it is free and fair.Around one-fifth of the country's 330 townships, including the cities of Yangon and Mandalay, voted in the last stage. Six parties, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), fielded candidates nationwide, while another 51 parties and independent candidates decided to contest state and regional levels.Two previous rounds were held on 28 December and 11 January - giving overwhelming victories to the USDP.The party won only 6% of parliamentary seats in the last free election in 2020.As in previous rounds of this strange, month-long election, voting was orderly and peaceful at the polling station in Nyaungshwe, Shan State, which a BBC team observed. Set in a large school, shaded by huge rain trees, there were ample volunteers an officials to guide voters where to go, and how to make their choice using the new, locally-made electronic voting machines. You could be forgiven for believing this was a normal democratic exercise, not the sham its critics say it is.However polling day was preceded by a campaigning period marked by fear, intimidation and a pervasive sense that little will change after the inevitable victory by the USDP. Everywhere the BBC team travelled in southern Shan State, we were followed and closely monitored by dozens of police and military officials, always polite but very persistent. It proved nearly impossible to get people to say anything about the vote, so nervous were they of possible repercussions.The next steps after final results are announced are laid down in the military-drafted constitution. Parliament will meet within the next two months to choose a new president, and everyone expects that to be the coup leader Gen Min Aung Hlaing. It will be the same regime with civilian clothes. But he will then have to relinquish his command of the armed forces. His replacement is certain to be a loyalist, but his hold over the ranks of the military will inevitably be less secure, and it is no secret that many other senior officers do not believe he has made a good job of leading the country. With many more voices in politics, there is the possibility of wider debate inside government over which direction Myanmar should now take, and the possibility - distant for now - of the first steps towards ending the civil war.The military junta took control of Myanmar in a 2021 coup, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi.She remains in detention and, like many other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been formally dissolved.The military has been fighting against both armed resistance groups which oppose the coup and ethnic armies that have their own militias. It lost control of large parts of the country in a series of major setbacks, but clawed back territory this year enabled by support from China and Russia.The civil war has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more, destroyed the economy and left a humanitarian vacuum. A devastating earthquake in March and international funding cuts have made the situation far worse.",

    "body": "14 hours agoIsaac AsheEast MidlandsSuppliedThe woman, who did not wish to be identified, said she \"felt sick\" after finding the device hidden underneath the seat of a toilet she had just usedA woman has said she felt \"violated\" after finding a live-streaming camera hidden inside a toilet she had been using while on a date at a restaurant.The 32-year-old mother-of-one was on a date night with her partner at Thai restaurant Giggling Squid in St Martin's Square, Leicester, between Christmas and new year when she made the discovery and alerted staff.Leicestershire Police was notified and carried out an investigation, but no arrests have yet been made by the force.The victim told the BBC: \"It makes me feel sick - I've tried to disassociate myself from it but whoever has done that has won, they have that of me now.\"The NHS worker had visited the restaurant on 30 December for a meal when, after eating, she needed to use the bathroom.But after using a toilet inside a cubicle, she realised there was a black camera - with kitchen roll wrapped around it - under the toilet seat with a black lens visible. The camera was later found to be connected to the internet.She said: \"I turned around and I looked down and I saw this black round dot - it was a bit out of place because the toilet's white.\"It was just there, a small camera, some wires coming off of it, and then a battery pack with kitchen roll over it, and my stomach just sank.\"The thought of someone watching, especially in such a private area, scared me. It's a really uncomfortable thing to think about, that somebody's got that now.\"There must have been so many people visiting that toilet.\"The victim had been on a date night when she found the device under the toilet seat at the Giggling Squid restaurantLeicestershire Police said it was notified the following day about the webcam at the restaurant chain.A spokesperson said: \"Officers attended and the device was recovered for examination.\"Further inquiries were carried out regarding CCTV in the restaurant and staff were spoken to in order to try and identify the person responsible.\"Advice has also been given to staff about remaining vigilant.\"A spokesperson for Giggling Restaurants, the company that runs the restaurant, said a customer had reported a \"suspicious object\" to staff on the night it was found.They said: \"Our staff did the right thing and informed police right away, who now have the item in their possession.\"We are co-operating fully with their inquiries.\"The restaurant said it was \"co-operating fully\" with the police investigationThe victim added she hoped sharing her experience would save other people from being targeted.\"I'm trying to get people to think when they go in public situations, look everywhere, even in places that we wouldn't even think would be unsafe,\" she said.\"When I've spoken to people about it, it's not something that anybody's ever thought about, nobody looks at under the toilet seats or has a little scan before they use the toilet.\"If this helps somebody spot it before it can escalate, then great.\"Related internet links",

    "body": "'Beautiful' rare octopus spotted on popular Welsh beach4 days agoOscar EdwardsBBC WalesGareth DaviesThe octopus was seen at low tide on North Beach in Tenby A photographer who was enjoying a walk on a popular Welsh beach says he became \"completely absorbed\" after spotting an octopus.Gareth Davies witnessed the \"beautiful\" orange cephalopod as it buried itself in the sand in Tenby, Pembrokeshire, and \"vanished\" in an \"effortless display of camouflage\".He said the sighting was unexpected, but that the beauty of a seaside walk is that you never know \"what might turn up\".It comes after record numbers were spotted in the UK last year, leading to a wildlife charity declaring 2025 as \"the Year of the Blooming Octopus\". This is not the first time an octopus has washed up Welsh shores, after two were seen and rescued, while crawling on a Ceredigion beach in 2022.On another occasion, an octopus was spotted changing colour in footage captured at Menai Bridge beach on Anglesey.Gareth, a professional photographer from Pembroke, said the low tide at North Beach in Tenby led to a \"sense of anticipation\" that was soon rewarded.\"I unexpectedly came across a beautiful common octopus,\" he said. \"I watched, completely absorbed, as it began to bury itself in the sand, its skin shifting colour and texture in an effortless display of camouflage.\"The octopus \"soon vanished from sight, as quietly as it had appeared\", he added.Gareth DaviesGareth said the octopus buried itself in the sand in an \"effortless display of camouflage\"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of octopuses seen in UK waters with warmer winters, which are linked to climate change, thought to be responsible for the population spike.The Wildlife Trusts said the highest number of octopuses had been seen off the south coast of Devon and Cornwall last year since 1950.Gareth said he saw what he thinks is a common octopus, which despite its name is not very common in UK waters.He described them as a \"highly intelligent\" and \"active predator\" equipped with \"specialised glands that produce venom to incapacitate its prey\".The octopus increase does however pose a problem for shellfish species around the UK shores.The eight-armed creatures eat shellfish such as lobster, crabs and scallops so the Wildlife Trusts has warned that if population numbers remain high, both fishing and eating habits may have to change.Gareth DaviesThere was a record number of octopus sightings on UK shores last yearMore top stories",

The research in 2019 also found that girls' costs are considerably higher than boys'.Vivienne Wood decided to host the dress fitting event after receiving a donation of 14 First Communion dresses from Long Tower Primary School The shop raises funds for a local charity in Derry that helps people dealing with addiction.\"Being a charity shop, we hear about people's struggles with financial pressures all the time,\" Wood said.Appointments for the children were granted on a first-come, first-served basis via social media.\"When I was given the dresses, this was something I felt I needed to do,\" she added.\"To see the wee girls' faces light up, it was just amazing, an experience I will never forget.\"Where did the dresses come from?Claire Doherty, the principal of Long Tower Primary School, said she was delighted the dresses could help families with costs Claire Doherty, the principal of Long Tower Primary School, said the dresses had originally been donated to the school but, despite efforts to encourage parents to take them, they had ended up in storage.\"I felt that we could put the dresses to better use and help people in the community, so I reached out to Vivienne,\" Doherty said.It was \"really magical\" for the children, she said, and there are some \"very happy little girls\" as a result.\"First Communion is a beautiful day, but over the years it has become so expensive,\" she said.\"The price of dresses alone puts families under a lot of pressure and I'm glad our school could help some families reduce that cost.\"For more on this story",

The building, named Taipei 101 for the number of its floors, is 508m (1,667ft) tall, made of steel, glass and concrete and is designed to resemble a stick of bamboo.Honnold is renowned for being the first person to climb El Capitan without ropes or safety gear. The 915m (3,000 foot) granite cliff is in California's Yosemite national park.The climb was originally set to take place on Saturday but was delayed by wet weather. His ascent in Taiwan's capital was streamed live on Netflix, which said there was a delay on the live feed should the worst happen. \"We'll cut away,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine in the run-up to the event. \"Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"Honnold completed the climb in one hour and 31 minutes on Sunday - and celebrated the achievement with one word: \"Sick.\"His time more than halves the record of the only other person to scale the tower. Alain Robert, a Frenchman who called himself \"Spiderman\", made it to the top of Taipei 101 - at the time the world's tallest building - in four hours.

    "body": "6 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe new body will buy technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all police forcesA new National Police Service (NPS) will free up local forces to tackle everyday crime by taking over responsibility for counter-terror, fraud and organised crime investigations, the home secretary has said.Shabana Mahmood told the BBC the NPS, which she has dubbed a \"British FBI\", was \"absolutely not\" about saving money but about designing a new policing model for England and Wales.It will bring the work of existing agencies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional organised crime units under the same organisation, buying new technology such as facial recognition on behalf of all forces.Mahmood said the current policing system was \"broken\" and the new body will form part of a series of police reforms for England and Wales which she will unveil on Monday.Other reforms announced recently include:The number of police forces in England and Wales will be \"significantly\" cut from the current 43. Police chiefs have been calling for the creation of 12 \"mega\" forcesEvery police officer in England and Wales will have to have a licence to practiseIncreased powers for ministers to intervene where police and fire chiefs are deemed to be failingThe NPS will cover England and Wales but be able to operate in the wider UK, setting standards and training. It will be led by a national police commissioner who will become the most senior police chief in the country.The Home Office said local police officers have been \"burdened\" with tackling major crimes without adequate training, leaving them unable to address everyday offences like shoplifting and anti-social behaviour.Mahmood told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg there was an \"epidemic of everyday crime\" such as phone thefts and shoplifting which often went \"unpunished\".\"What I'm trying to do is design a new model for policing in this country which means we can deal with all of that everyday crime, that it is punished, that communities can have confidence that those sorts of criminals will not be able to run amok and have a national police service which can go after international criminals and national criminals who don't respect borders,\" she said. Currently some national investigations are dealt with by local forces, with the Metropolitan Police responsible for counter-terror policing, the National Air Service run by West Yorkshire Police and National Roads Policing by Sussex Police.These would all be brought under the NPS, along with the work of the National Crime Agency (NCA).Intelligence and resources will be shared across different forces in stages to ensure the public receive the same level of security \"no matter where they live\", the Home Office said in a statement.It is not the first time police reforms have been described as a \"British FBI\". In 2006, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was nicknamed \"Britain's FBI\". The Coalition government later replaced this with the NCA, which was again dubbed \"Britain's FBI\".The Home Office says it will also look to hire new talent outside of the force for leadership roles. Although Mahmood said everyday crime is on the rise, overall crime - including more serious offences - has fallen.The government claims facial recognition has led to a rapid reduction in crime - reportedly leading to 1,700 arrests in the past two years - but campaigners have raised concerns over issues with bias and privacy.Labour wants to shake up the police - but will that solve 'everyday crime epidemic'?Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency, backed the new national force and said \"the overall policing system is out of date. Crime has changed, technology has changed, and how we respond needs to change\".He added: \"These are threats that affect us all locally, but need a national and international response.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the changes \"must not come at the expense of local community policing\".He said: \"More top-down reorganisation risks undermining efforts to catch criminals and it delivers no real improvement on the ground.\"The plans have drawn mixed reaction from senior figures in policing, with the Police Federation warning that \"fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities\".The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC) also warned that the creation of regional forces would be expensive, time-consuming and risks separating police forces from their communities.In November, ministers announced plans to scrap police and crime commissioners in 2028 to save at least £100m and help fund neighbourhood policing.Mahmood is seeking to give home secretaries the power to sack police chiefs and she said it was important to have accountability because \"when something goes horribly wrong\" with policing every body looks at the home secretary.She said she would have sacked the former chief of West Midlands Police Craig Guildford, who initially refused to resign despite an outcry over the force's handling of a decision to ban Israeli football fans from attending a match.Correction 25 January 2026: Article was amended to remove a line saying there would be 12 \"mega\" forces, as the final number has not yet been confirmed by the Home Office. A line was added saying police chiefs have called for 12 \"mega\" forces.",

    "body": "50 minutes agoThomas MackintoshReutersThe Grinch was intercepted by the French navy on ThursdayFrench officials have taken the Indian captain of a suspected Russian shadow fleet tanker into custody days after the oil tanker was seized.On Thursday, the French navy intercepted the tanker - named the Grinch - which President Emmanuel Macron said was \"subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag\".The Grinch had been travelling through the Mediterranean Sea from the Russian Arctic port of Murmansk. It is now moored, under guard, at a southern French port near Marseille.Although Moscow is yet to comment, Macron said on Thursday that the shadow fleet helped to \"finance Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine\".The office of the Marseille prosecutor office said the rest of the ship's crew members - all also Indians - were being \"kept on board\" while the 58-year-old captain was taken into custody.\"The investigation aims to verify the validity of the flag used by the tanker,\" prosecutors said. French media report say it was sailing under a Comoros Islands flag.  Nautical and air exclusion zones have been established around the anchorage site, officials say.French Joint Staff of the Armed ForcesSoldiers searched the vessel after it was seized in the MediterraneanAnnouncing the seizure on Thursday, Macron said: \"We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions.\"Many Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian energy following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Earlier in January, British armed forces supported a US operation to seize a Russian-flagged tanker in the Atlantic that US officials said had broken sanctions by carrying oil for Venezuela and Russia.Last October, France seized another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast before releasing it a few days later.Shadow fleets are becoming increasingly common, with Venezuela, Iran and Russia all accused of using them to avoid sanctions on oil.Financial intelligence firm S&P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.More on this story",

    "body": "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said the government should start selling war bonds as there is a need to \"move far faster\" on UK defence spending. Under his party's plan, members of the public could loan the government money in the form of a bond which would run over a two-to-three year period and pay out the same interest as standard government bonds. Davey said the bonds, which the party says could raise up to £20bn for the military, would give the public a chance to \"support patriotically our defence\". A government spokesperson said \"new debt instruments\" were kept under review but that they had to represent \"value for money\" and \"be consistent with wider fiscal objectives\". Calls to increase defence spending have intensified in recent years, following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the election of US President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticised Nato countries for failing to spend enough on their military. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Davey said a move to sell war bonds was needed as \"we're in almost a Cold War type scenario\", citing the Russian use of drones, submarines and shadow fleets. He continued: \"This is a serious threat, and we need to move far faster than what the government has been doing.\"We need to go rapidly.\"The Labour government has pledged to raise overall defence spending from 2.3% to 2.5% of national income by 2027, at an estimated cost of an additional £6bn a year.It has also promised to raise levels to 3.5% by 2035, in line with a pledge by Nato members last year. However, there have been reports in the Times and the Sun that plans to make Britain's armed forces \"war ready\" will require £28bn more than has so far been allocated.The government had been due to publish its defence investment plan last autumn but there are suggestions it has been delayed due to concerns about cost.Earlier this month, the head of the Armed Forces, Sir Richard Knighton, said the UK was \"not as ready as we need to be for the kind of full-scale conflict we might face\".On Sunday, Davey said: \"Everyone can see that since the last election things have changed dramatically. The way that Putin is prosecuting that [Ukraine] war, but as significantly, the attitude of Donald Trump to supporting European defence.\"He expressed concern about the Nato alliance given the approach of the US president. \"I deeply regret to say, because of Donald Trump, there has to be a question about whether we can rely on the Untied States. With him in the White House they're no longer a reliable ally. We have to step up and fast,\" he told the BBC.The Liberal Democrats said the money raised from issuing bonds would be ring-fenced for defence and the investment would help deliver \"growth, jobs and higher revenues\" for the government \"which would partially offset the cost of additional debt servicing\".The party added the scheme would need to be accompanied by an overhaul of the Ministry of Defence procurement process, which has previously been criticised as wasteful. Their proposal, the party says, would be similar to the bonds scheme used during World War One and World War Two. Individual citizens could lend the government money, which would be paid back in six to 10 years with interest. By the end of 1945, the scheme had raised £1.754m.Posters encouraging members of the public to buy bonds - or national savings certificates - used slogans including \"lend to defend\" and \"feed the guns with war bonds\". Dan Coatsworth, head of markets at investors AJ Bell, said: \"War bonds are a proven way of raising money to fund national defence spending, but they can burden a government with long-term debt. \"In theory, the public might demand a better rate of interest than they could get on cash in the bank to take up the bonds. \"While some people might think it is their duty to support the country, there will be others who treat such a bond in the same way as any type of investment.\" ",

    "body": "4 hours agoJacob PhillipsFamily handoutAlex Pretti was killed in Minneapolis on SaturdayA man who was shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis has been identified by his family as 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.He has been described as an avid outdoorsman who loved mountain biking and is understood to have joined protests after Renee Good, also 37, was shot dead by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent in her car earlier this month.Conflicting accounts have emerged about the moments leading up to his death.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an agent fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they claim had a handgun, resisted attempts to disarm him. Some eyewitnesses and officials, as well as Pretti's family, have challenged that account.Pretti worked as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, his family said in a statement. They told the Associated Press news agency (AP) that he was upset by US President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration in the city. Pretti's mother also said her son cared immensely about the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti told AP. She added: \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"Pretti had no interactions with law enforcement beyond traffic tickets, family sayPretti loved adventures with his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog Joule, who died around a year ago, AP reported. His family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to AP, court records show he had no criminal record.Pretti's parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful while protesting.\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" his father Michael Pretti told AP. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"Pretti's family also explained he owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota - but they had never known him to carry it.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, the BBC's US partner CBS reported. 'Please get the truth out about our son'After seeing videos suggesting their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family issued a statement saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".They claimed videos showed Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents. \"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" they urged in their statement.Pretti was a Democratic voter and had taken part in the wave of street protests after George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, his ex-wife told AP.She said that he was someone who may shout at law enforcement officers at a protest but had never known him to be physically confrontational.ReutersA woman cries as people gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was shotA US citizen born in Illinois, Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir. He went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to his family.He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before he was shot dead when they spoke about repairs he had done to the garage door at his home, AP reported. A Latino man had completed the work and Pretti's parents said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 (£74) tip.Doctor Dmitri Drekonja, who worked with Pretti, told ABC News the pair had bonded over their interest in mountain biking and would compare notes on which trails to ride.\"He was the type of person you enjoyed being around and the notion that this helpful, smiling joking guy was being labelled a terrorist? It's galling,\" he said.ReutersPeople gather around a makeshift memorial close to where Alex Pretti was fatally shotNeighbours described Pretti as quiet and warmhearted.\"He's a wonderful person,\" Sue Gitar told AP, who lived downstairs from the nurse and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said.\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",

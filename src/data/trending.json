    "body": "42 minutes agoChris MasonPolitical editorWhat an extraordinary few days it has been for UK-US relations, with three developments each pointing in a different direction.Imagine being a fly on the phone line as the prime minister and President Trump caught up last night, speaking for the first time since this blitz of recent overseas activity from the White House.Firstly, there has been the outright public scepticism from the UK and European allies to America's designs on Greenland.Secondly, the circumspect position of the British government on Washington's actions in Venezuela – in which the prime minister welcomed the ends, the removal of President Maduro, but didn't want to be publicly drawn on the legality or otherwise of the means.And then, thirdly, the pride in assisting America in the seizing of a ship in the North Atlantic, itself a reminder of how close to home this brings the headlines of recent days.As one MP put it in the Commons, one of the frontlines against Russia is in our own backyard, off the north coast of Scotland.The argument made in government is assisting America in seizing the Marinera was a no brainer, because this ship had connections not just to Venezuela but also to both Iran and Russia – adversaries of the US and the UK.On Wednesday morning, after around a week of planning, the UK supported an American operation to seize the Russian flagged ship.There were three strands to Britain's support: allowing airbases in the UK to be used prior to and after the operation, providing a support vessel, known as RFA Tideforce to help the American forces and planes from the Royal Air Force providing what has been described as \"surveillance support\".RFA Tideforce has the capability of refuelling other ships, has a helipad and a medical unit.Defence Secretary John Healey points out that the Marinera and ships like it are helping to finance Russia's war in Ukraine.Healey told MPs the UK's involvement was in compliance with international law as it was in breach of sanctions imposed on Iran.He said the vessel, sanctioned by the US since 2024, had moved 7.3m barrels of oil on behalf of Iran.Iran's evasion of sanctions \"financed terror across the world\", he said, naming Hamas, Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthis as beneficiaries.He said it was \"telling\" that the ship, while attempting to evade capture, had \"adopted the Russian flag\".The UK remains committed to \"deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet\", he added.It was, he said, a key part of the UK's steadfast support for Ukraine, as he took questions from MPs for nearly two hours about both the tanker and the prospect of British troops being sent to Ukraine after any peace deal is secured.There is a widespread pride across the House of Commons for the support the UK has provided to Kyiv in recent years, but there are plenty of questions about the implications of the government's promise of military help.How many troops could it involve, for how long, and doing precisely what?There are no answers yet to these questions, but ministers are saying there will be a debate and a vote in the Commons before any deployment.",

    "body": "2 hours agoBBCMetro calls the US seizure of a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic a \"splash & grab\". President Donald Trump has \"gambled on another confrontation with the world\", it writes, adding that RAF aircraft aided American forces in the mission.The i Paper understands that the UK is \"ready to seize more\" of Putin's \"shadow ships\" on its own. The possible future missions would be intended to \"stop the illegal flow of oil\" and would be part of a growing \"grey war\". This refers to hostile action that doesn't meet the threshold of an all-out war.The US has said it will control Venezuelan crude oil sakes \"indefinitely\" on the same day that it seized the Russian tanker in the North Atlantic, the FT reports. This marks \"an escalation in Donald Trump's gambit to overhaul the global oil market\". The Times headlines: \"UK joins in the pursuit of Putin's shadow fleet\". Unnamed sources have told the paper that the UK had been aiding the US in planning the mission after it \"slipped through a maritime blockade of Venezuela\". The paper also highlights the \"crime spree\" committed by Met police officers who were not properly vetted.The Guardian also leads with the \"high-stakes Atlantic operation\", adding that a second vessel is \"said to be violating sanctions in Carribbean\".There is \"Kremlin fury\" over the UK's help in the tanker seizure operation, reports the Independent. The vessel was captured between Iceland and Scotland in a \"dramatic move that could put Donald Trump on a collision course with Vladimir Putin\", the paper says.The \"Badenoch blueprint to save our pubs\" leads the Daily Telegraph, as the Conservative leader pledges to abolish business rates for \"thousands of pubs\". The paper also reports on the Met Police vetting story.\"Don't run down clock on 'safe' right to die law\" says the Daily Express. Campaigners say that the House of Lords will cause \"significant harm\" to its reputation if peers don't pass the assisted dying legislation.\"You need to be on fat jabs for life\" writes the Daily Mail following the publication of a University of Oxford study. Most people using the injections will regain the weight they lose \"inside two years of stopping treatment\", it reports. Meanwhile there is \"shock\" as Claudia Winkleman reveals \"lovely\" secret traitor.\"Look who's Huw\" headlines the Sun as it heralds a new TV drama based on its investigation into former BBC News presenter Huw Edwards. Actor Martin Clunes will play the newsreader, who plead guilty to making indecent images of children in July 2024.The Daily Mirror calls for \"Jesy tests\" after the former Little Mix star Jesy Nelson spoke out about her babies' muscular condition SMA (spinal muscular atrophy). All newborns should be tested for the devastating condition, the paper writes.\"As Trump nabs oil ship\" the Daily Star speaks to farmers in Scotland - which it refers to as \"the UK's Greenland\". They tell \"golf nut Don\" that \"you can take our greens but not our land\". So there you go.The Times leads on the US seizure of oil tankers bound for Russia, with the help of the Royal Navy. \"UK joins in the pursuit of Putin's shadow fleet\", reads its headline. It says Britain had been helping the US plan the operation for as long as a week. The i Paper says the UK will help capture more vessels to stop the illegal flow of oil. The Guardian's front page features an image of US forces boarding a second tanker in the Caribbean.The Daily Mail reports on the study from Oxford University, which says the millions of British people taking weight-loss jabs may need to stay on them for life. The review found most users regain the weight inside two years of stopping treatment - much faster than traditional dieters.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has pledged to abolish business rates for thousands of pubs across the UK, according to the Daily Telegraph. Its report says the average pub's energy bills would be cut by £1,000 under her plans.The Guardian says Chancellor Rachel Reeves has criticised a suggestion by Nigel Farage that only British-born families should have the two-child benefit cap lifted. She said the Reform UK leader would keep children in poverty based on the colour of their skin. Legislation to lift the cap will be introduced to Parliament on Thursday.  Farage has said he would vote against it because he is concerned it would benefit \"huge numbers of foreign-born people\".The Sun's front page features a picture of the actor, Martin Clunes, in a new role as the former BBC newsreader, Huw Edwards. Channel 5 is airing a two-part drama about the 64-year-old's firing in 2024. \"Look who's Huw\", reads the Sun's headline.Scientists have for the first time recovered DNA that may belong to Leonardo da Vinci, according to a report in the Times. It was taken from a painting called Holy Child, whose authorship is disputed. The team behind the Leonardo da Vinci DNA Project have long been trying to reconstruct the artist's genome to answer the many theories about his genius.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "6 hours agoVanessa ClarkeEducation reporterGCSE students across England will be able to view their exams results on their phones for the first time in August.An \"education record\" app, trialled with 95,000 pupils in Manchester and the West Midlands last summer, will initially download the results - and also allow Year 11 students to then store a digital record of those results for future use, such as when applying for jobs or further education.However students will still be encouraged to go into school on results day to receive \"advice or support\", headteachers say.One incentive to do so is that while the traditional brown envelopes containing the much-anticipated grades will still be available to collect in person from 08:00 on results day, the new app will not get its update until 11:00.The app will also hold information for schools and colleges on whether students have special educational needs and disabilities, or are eligible for free school meals.The Department for Education estimates the rollout could save schools and colleges up to £30m a year in administrative costs because of the costs and time currently involved in sharing information that now every teenager will be able to show on request at subsequent stages in their education.\"No student should have to rifle through drawers looking for a crumpled certificate when they're preparing for a job interview,\" Skills Minister Baroness Jacqui Smith said.\"This app will give young people instant access to their results whenever they need them while freeing up teachers and college staff from unnecessary paperwork.\"Schools are being encouraged to sign up so pupils can download and set up the app before the summer results day.Almost all of the students at Meadow Park School in Coventry, which took part in the pilot during the summer, still came into school on results day to pick up their brown envelopes according to headteacher Bernadette Pettman. \"The traditional brown envelope moment is still an important milestone for students, it's a chance to see friends, celebrate together, and connect with staff,\" Pettman told the BBC. Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was important for young people to have an accessible record of their achievements but stressed that students should still collect exam results in person.\"This face-to-face contact not only allows them to celebrate with peers and teachers, but also to receive any advice or support they may require regarding next steps.\"\"We are sure that school and college leaders will also welcome the administrative savings made possible as a result of this change, although this will only amount to a drop in the ocean compared to the funding pressures they remain under,\" he added.Students in Scotland, where there is a different set of exams for pupils at 16, have been able to get their results through an online app since 2019.In Wales and Northern Ireland, where pupils sit GCSEs but the education system is politically devolved, no changes to the results prodecure have been announced.Exams themselves do continue to evolve. Last month the exams watchdog in England, Ofqual, announced that around eight GCSE and A-level exams could switch from the traditional pen-and-paper method to on-screen assessments from 2030.Teachers, exam boards and parents are being asked for their views on that proposal.Ofqual's chief regulator Sir Ian Bauckham says any changes to exams would have to be fair, fully tested and top quality.Additional reporting by Rahib Khan",

    "body": "8 hours agoNoor Nanji & Zoe ConwayBBC NewsA group of trade unions has alleged McDonald's has violated international labour standards by failing to tackle sexual harassment in its UK restaurants and franchises.It comes after a BBC investigation exposed a toxic culture at the fast-food chain in which workers, some as young as 17, were being groped and harassed. Last year, McDonald's staff told us they still faced sexual abuse and harassment.The unions complained to an independent unit within government which has now offered to intervene by mediating between the unions and McDonald's.The fast-food chain said it was \"reviewing the information and considering next steps\".The complaint from trade unions was referred to the UK National Contact Point (NCP) - an independent unit which sits with the Department for Business and Trade, run by a mix of civil servants and external advisors.After conducting an initial assessment, the UK NCP has decided the complaint merits further consideration and will now offer mediation to both parties.McDonald's - A toxic workplace for teenagers?The group of five trade unions, including the Bakers Union and the TUC, alongside the Corporate Justice Coalition, state that their complaint - which was lodged in February 2024 - was prompted by the BBC's investigation.The complaint said there had been \"further evidence of persistent, deeply rooted gender-based discrimination\" in McDonald's restaurants, in breach of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidelines.It described \"repeated episodes\" of harassment against McDonald's workers, \"most of them teenagers\". It also accuses managers of failing to stop such behaviour.The Department of Business and Trade said its decision to accept the complaint is not a finding against McDonald's. It also said it does not mean that it considers that the company has acted inconsistently with OECD guidelines.It said the mediation offer is voluntary and if any party declines to take part, the UK NCP will conduct a further examination of the complaint.Ian Hodson, president of the Bakers Union, said the stories exposed in the BBC investigation were \"horrific\" and had \"helped to shine a light on workplace harassment\".\"The most important thing to me is the workers,\" he told BBC News. \"Their voices need to be heard. Everyone deserves the right to be safe when they go to work.\"Luise Schroter, senior policy officer at the Corporate Justice Coalition, said harassment at McDonald's \"must end\".\"Workers and their unions are key to ending these systemic abuses and must not be sidelined,\" she said.McDonald's workers speak out over sexual abuse claimsMcDonald's workers make fresh harassment claimsMcDonald's abuse: MeToo hasn’t helped these teenage workersAfter the initial BBC investigation, McDonald's apologised and set up a new unit to deal with complaints.But since then, more than 160 people have approached the BBC with allegations, while the EHRC has heard 300 reported incidents of harassment.Last January, McDonald's workers told us they still faced sexual harassment more than a year after its chief executive promised to clean up behaviour at the fast-food chain.More than 700 current and former junior employees are now taking legal action against the firm.Kiran Daurka, employment partner at law firm Leigh Day, which is representing the workers, says their clients accuse McDonald’s of failing to protect them.In November, the equality watchdog said McDonald's would bring in new sexual harassment training for managers in strengthened measures agreed with it to protect its staff from abuse.At the time, McDonald's said it welcomed the new measures, adding that they would \"build on the significant progress we have already made in this space\".Responding to the latest developments, a McDonald's spokesperson said: \"We are aware of the NCP's initial assessment and continue to engage constructively with the OECD process.\"We are reviewing the information and considering next steps.\"",

    "body": "A high-powered lawyer for Nick Reiner, who is charged with murdering his Hollywood director father Rob Reiner and mother Michele, has withdrawn from the case.It emerged that Alan Jackson would no longer represent Nick Reiner during a court hearing, though the attorney said afterwards that he believed his now-former client was innocent.Reiner, 32, did not enter a plea to charges of first-degree murder of his parents during a brief appearance at Los Angeles Superior Court.The Reiners were found dead with stab wounds on 14 December in the bedroom of their home in Brentwood, Los Angeles.Jackson said outside court after Wednesday's hearing that he had left the case.\"Circumstances beyond my control, but more importantly circumstances beyond Nick's control, have made it impossible for us to continue our representation,\" he told reporters.\"I'm legally and ethically prohibited from explaining the reasons why.\"The lawyer, who has previously represented Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, added that Reiner was not guilty of murder.But LA County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said otherwise outside court.\"We are fully confident that a jury will convict Nick Reiner beyond a reasonable doubt of the brutal murder of his parents - Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner,\" said the prosecutor.The accused will now be represented in court by a public defender.To qualify for a publicly funded attorney, defendants must show they lack the means to fund their legal case.Rob Reiner's net worth was estimated at $200m (£150m) and it is unclear who was paying the retainer for his son's high-powered attorney. The accused has a brother and sister.When asked by the judge if he understood that he was waiving his right to enter a plea on Wednesday, Reiner said: \"Yeah, I agree with it.\"The defendant smiled a few times during the hearing as he spoke to sheriffs' deputies.His new lawyer, public defender Kimberly Greene, met Reiner and asked for time to prepare for the case before her new client entered a plea.The next hearing is set for 23 February.Rob Reiner, 78, directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner, 70, was an actress, photographer and producer.Watch: \"I'm learning about being a parent\" - Rob Reiner talks to the BBC's Tim Sebastian in 1998",

    "body": "Russian attacks left Ukraine's southeastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia almost entirely without power, the country's energy ministry said on Wednesday night. Critical infrastructure was \"operating on reserve power\", it said in a statement on Telegram, while officials said water supplies and the internet were also disrupted. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, aimed at paralysing power supplies during a harsh winter.\"Ukraine's energy system is under enemy attacks every day, and energy workers are operating in extremely difficult conditions to provide people with light and heat,\" Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on Telegram.\"Deteriorating weather conditions put additional strain on critical infrastructure,\" she said.The disruptions to power and heating have come as temperatures plunge. \"Emergency restoration work in the regions affected by the attack will begin immediately as soon as the security situation allows,\" state energy company Ukrenergo said on Telegram. It added: \"The primary task of energy workers is to restore critical infrastructure.\"Dnipro city Mayor Borys Filatov said on Telegram all city hospitals had been completely switched to generators. \"There are the necessary water supplies, the treatment process does not stop. Water drainage in houses is also supported by alternative power sources,\" Filatov said.School holidays had been extended until 9 January because of the power cuts, he added. The head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, Ivan Fedorov, said everything possible was being done to restore power.\"At this time, water utility workers have almost restored water to our homes, despite the fact that there is a complete blackout in the region,\" Fedorov said in a video message published on Telegram.DTEK, Ukraine's biggest private energy provider, is living in permanent crisis mode because of Russian attacks on the grid, its chief executive told the BBC last month, with most of Ukraine suffering from lengthy power cuts during winter.Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, which provides power for 5.6 million Ukrainians, said the intensity of strikes had been so frequent \"we just don't have time to recover\".As the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion approaches, Timchenko said Russia had repeatedly targeted DTEK's energy grid with \"waves of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles\" and his company had found it difficult to cope.The attacks come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said European allies have not given him sound guarantees that they will protect his country in the event of new Russian aggression.Following talks in Paris on Tuesday, the UK and France signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops in Ukraine if a peace deal is made with Russia.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any foreign troops in Ukraine would be a \"legitimate target\".",

He then signed for Coventry City and later played for Tottenham Hotspur, the Vancouver Whitecaps and Bradford City, before finishing his playing career with a solitary appearance for Swansea City.Yorath, the father of BBC Sport presenter Gabby Logan, also won 59 caps for Wales.\"To most he was a revered footballing hero, but to us he was Dad; a quiet, kind and gentle man. Our hearts are broken but we take comfort knowing that he will be reunited with our brother, Daniel,\" Yorath's children said in a statement.In addition to Gabby, Yorath had three other children - Daniel, Louise and Jordan. In 1992, Daniel died aged 15 from the genetic heart condition hypertrophic cardiomyopathy while playing football at home with his father.Yorath served as player-coach while at Bradford and was assistant coach on the day of the Valley Parade fire in 1985, which killed 56 fans and injured 270.He managed Bradford, Swansea, Cardiff City and Sheffield Wednesday as well as a having successful spell in charge of Wales, during which they were one game from reaching the 1994 World Cup finals.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDavid GrittenFootage shows protesters march in the streets of AligudarzThere were violent clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces in several locations in Iran on Wednesday, as a wave of unrest sparked by the country's economic crisis continued for an 11th day.Iran's semi-official Fars news agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, said two policemen were shot and killed by armed individuals in the south-western town of Lordegan.Videos posted on social media showed a tense stand-off between protesters and security forces, with the sound of gunfire in the background.In footage from several other areas, security forces appear to fire guns and tear gas towards crowds of protesters, some of whom are throwing stones.The protests have so far spread to 111 cities and towns across all 31 provinces, according to the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA).It has reported that at least 34 protesters and four security personnel have been killed during the unrest, and that 2,200 protesters have been arrested.BBC Persian has confirmed the deaths and identities of 21 people, while Iranian authorities have reported the deaths of five security personnel.The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of the capital, Tehran, to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans against the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and sometimes in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's late former shah.On Wednesday, videos verified by BBC Persian showed crowds protesting in Qazvin, north-west of Tehran, and chanting slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - as well as \"Long live the shah\".Footage from the Gulf port of Bandar Abbas, showed protesters chanting \"Police force, support, support\" before security forces disperse them.In the Shia holy city of Mashhad, in the country's north-west, protesters were seen clashing with security forces and forcing them to retreat. Another video showed people chanting in support of the Pahlavi dynasty, which was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution.In the late afternoon, a large demonstration also took place in the south-western city of Abadan, near the border with Iraq, according to footage verified by BBC Persian, in which protesters chanted \"Cannon, tanks, firecrackers! Mullahs must get lost\", a reference to Iran's clerical leadership.More footage filmed from a balcony in the city appeared to show security forces opening fire as they run away from advancing protesters, who are throwing stones and other objects.As night fell, security forces were filmed firing tear gas to disperse a protest in Aligudarz, another western city, after a crowd had gathered in a square chanting \"People's uprising, Viva!\"In Lordegan, Fars reported that two police officers were killed during a protest on Wednesday.It added that the officers, whom it named as Hadi Azarsalim and Moslem Mahdavinasab, were shot dead by \"armed individuals\" who had been among a group of what it called \"rioters\".It was not immediately possible to verify the report because the BBC and other independent international media are either not allowed to report from inside Iran or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements.However, Lordegan has been the scene of violent clashes during the unrest, with two protesters killed there last Thursday.Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Vice-President for Executive Affairs Mohammad Jafar Qaempanah said President Masoud Pezeshkian had ordered that \"no security measures\" be taken against peaceful protesters.\"Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters,\" he added.State media also reported that the government had begun paying 71 million citizens a new monthly allowance equivalent to $7 (£5) to ease the pain of the high cost of living.Meanwhile, judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei told police commanders that \"rioters\" would face \"rapid\" prosecution and punishment in order to serve as a deterrent.Khamenei - who, as supreme leader, has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".His comments came after President Donald Trump threatened that the US would intervene if Iranian security forces killed peaceful protesters, saying: \"We are locked and loaded.\"Dr Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told the BBC that the protests had quickly become political and were being driven by deep-seated anger among the public.\"People are fed up. They have no prospects for the future. Day-to-day life is becoming much more difficult,\" she said.\"If there is more momentum and if more people come out, [the protests] will be more serious and, of course, there the government response becomes more violent.\"Sadegh Zibakalam, a political science professor at the University of Tehran, said the Iranian authorities might be resisting a harsher crackdown because of Trump's threats.\"Some Iranian leaders - Revolutionary Guard commanders and security forces - maybe they are a bit more cautious and are not in a hurry to suppress the crowd this time fearing it may create an American intervention,\" he told the BBC.The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained in a violent crackdown on those protests by security forces, according to human rights groups.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmily HoltBBCKristina and Laura have written a book titled 'All the Cool Girls Get Fired' about their experiences. The new year is a natural time to reflect, and for many of us, that involves thinking about our careers. Kristina O'Neill and Laura Brown are both editors who lost their jobs after restructures, and they initially thought it was the end of the world.\"I poured my heart into the role... I believed in the values we promoted. Yet, when it came to me, those values weren't there,\" says Laura. They both chose to use the word fired after they lost their roles and say being open about it can help you deal with what's happened.\"There are so many euphemisms that we all use for losing our jobs. But the faster you own it, the faster you're honest about it, the faster you can move on.\"That's the fast track to whatever you want to do next,\" adds Laura.Now, they are thriving in new jobs, with Laura owning her own media company and Kristina editor in chief for Sotheby's magazine. If you've lost your job or are simply looking for a new career, here are four ways to help.1. Reflect on the past year Getty ImagesIt's natural to feel a bit low about work if  you've had a break over the festive period.Sarah Ellis, co-founder of careers website, Squiggly Careers and Amazing If, says it is important to reflect on the past year before diving into a new job search. She encourages people to think about what they want to do more or less of, and what inspires or drains their energy. Looking back through your successes to find common themes can help too. \"Try not to just look at the last month, because we all have a bit of recency bias that can get in the way,\" she adds.Laura says it is also important to decide where your work sits in your life.  This involves being honest about how much time you're working and its impact on your social and family life.After losing her role, she advises not letting your life be defined by your work.2. Take small steps Getty ImagesSarah says people can make small steps towards a career change without diving in head first. She took seven years to make the jump from her corporate career to running her own company full time, working on her project alongside her job, which meant she could pay herself from the start. \"It took a bit longer, but that was how I did it in a sustainable way\", she says. Sarah recommends a \"try before you buy\" approach.This could be volunteer work, getting involved in a work project that interests you, or saying yes to something different within your existing team.\"Worst case scenario, you don't like that area, but it's better to know now than to know when you've made the move,\" she says. Sarah also encourages looking into small \"bridging roles\". These may not be ideal, but serve as a step in the right direction, such as a role which has similarities to the career you want, but not in the exact industry.\"It's giving yourself space to say this is good for now, but that isn't the same as forever.\"That can be a really smart strategy for getting much closer to that career change.\"3. Remember your achievementsGetty ImagesIf you've recently lost your job, you aren't alone - redundancies have surged to their highest rate since 2021, official figures indicate.Laura was editor in chief of a style magazine, but in 2022 she and her team were laid off after her firm closed the print version of the magazine.  Understanding this did not mean she wasn't good at her job helped her process the change. \"What you've learned doesn't go away because you lost your job.\"Don't give your power up, it's important for everybody to remember their own value.\"Kristina was fired after a 10-year spell at a financial magazine after a regime change at the top and the arrival of a new editor. She stresses that so much of the shame of being fired is \"in your head\". \"In the US, especially hundreds of thousands of people being laid off, it's not personal. It's likely very much not you, so don't take that ball of shame and carry it around.\"4. Create a career check-list Getty ImagesIf you're desperately looking for work or utterly miserable in your current role, it can be tempting to dive straight into applying for any job - ignoring personal happiness. But Sarah says this is a big mistake.Instead, she suggests an exercise called \"scanning\" - narrowing your search down to job descriptions that sound interesting to you.She recommends going through websites like LinkedIn, and gathering around 10 to 15 that you like the look of.  \"What are the words that keep coming up?\" she says. \"Because [these] will give you some clues as to the things that matter most to you.Through this, you can create your own career check list, and avoid wasting time on ill-fitting applications.Laura stresses it's also important to think about what has made you happy and unhappy over the course of your career. \"It may not be what you can do all the time, but it could be something that's lit up in you, that you've forgotten,\" she says.

    "body": "9 hours agoGabriela Pomeroy & Alicia Curry,in LondonandAdrienne Murray,in CopenhagenMia ChemnitzMia Chemnitz says \"the people of Greenland do not want to become American\"\"The people of Greenland do not want to become American,\" Mia Chemnitz tells the BBC. \"We are not for sale.\"The 32-year-old business owner in the Greenlandic capital Nuuk reflects the sentiments of many who spoke to the BBC about how they felt about recent rhetoric from the Trump administration.The White House has said it was \"actively\" discussing an offer to buy the territory that has for centuries belonged to Denmark. US President Donald Trump and his officials had earlier intimated a willingness to take it by force if necessary.This has been met with nervousness and opprobrium among Greenlanders - both on the world's largest island and elsewhere.This nervousness has only grown since the US took Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro from his residence in Caracas to New York on drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in an unprecedented military move.Almost immediately after, the wife of a senior White House staffer indicated that Greenland was next.\"That's when it stopped feeling abstract,\" says Tupaarnaq Kopeck, 40, who moved to Canada - another place Trump has threatened to annex - for family and work.\"For the first time, I contacted my sister in Greenland and told her that if the unthinkable ever became reality, they would have a place to stay with us.\"Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, says the comments from the Trump administration are \"a clear threat\" that she was \"appalled\" by.\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she says.Tupaarnaq KopeckTupaarnaq Kopeck says the military intervention in Venezuela made the \"abstract\" feel realGreenland is the world's most sparsely populated territory. With much of the Arctic island covered by ice, most of the population lives in Nuuk and the surrounding south-western coastline.But it is strategically significant to the US - which is why it has had a military presence there since World War Two. Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks.More recently, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.\"It's not fun being 56,000 people and having these threats - if you can call them that - from a giant like the US,\" says Masaana Egede, editor of Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq.\"The citizens of Greenland are nervous about this, because this is not something that we take lightly.\"Experts generally agree that a military takeover of Greenland would be an easy undertaking for the US - but that the geopolitical fallout would effectively end the Nato alliance.After the issue of Greenland's ownership was raised anew by the White House, six European allies issued a statement saying its future should be decided by its people - something Mia says she is grateful for.But she worries this will matter little to the US \"if it's not backed with consequences and actions\".\"As a Greenlander, I can't help but wonder: what are we worth to these allies? To what lengths are they willing to go to protect us?\"Tupaarnaq says: \"Respect is about more than alliances on paper. When powerful nations talk about you instead of with you, that respect disappears very quickly.\"Aleqatsiaq PearyAleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter says a US takeover would just \"replace one occupier with another\"The Trump administration has stressed its intention was to buy Greenland from Denmark - despite Copenhagen reiterating the territory was not for sale - while retaining a military intervention as an option.Aaja sees annexation by force as unlikely - instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Polling consistently shows that Greenlanders generally favour eventual independence from Denmark but oppose being owned by the US. The territory is largely self-governing, with control of foreign affairs and defence retained by Copenhagen.This is perhaps why Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in the remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, seemed unfazed by the prospect of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he says. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"But he says: \"I don't have time for Trump. Our people are in need,\" explaining hunters like him hunt with dogs on the sea ice and fish, \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".For Sermitsiaq editor Masaana, the rhetoric from the US is pushing a fallacious binary choice.\"We really have to try to avoid getting the story going to a place where it's Greenland that has to decide between the US and Denmark, because that is not the choice that the Greenlandic people want.\"Christian KeldsenChristian Keldsen says \"people in Greenland are getting really irritated with this\"For others, who see the strong relationship Greenland already has with the US being soured, there is a clear sense of indignation.\"People in Greenland are getting really irritated with this,\" says Christian Keldsen of the Greenland Business Association.\"Greenlanders are welcoming and open-hearted, it's the best thing about the country. But now with this, some people are scared.\"Greenland is open for business with the US, Christian stresses, noting that there are new direct flights from Greenland to New York - a sure sign \"they don't need to take us over\".\"We are a well-functioning democracy and our government has a strong mandate,\" Mia says. \"We are a Nato ally and the US has had military bases in Greenland for over 70 years - and still has the right to establish and run new and more.\"As it has been stated from Greenland before: we are not for sale, but we're open for business.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJess WarrenLondonPA MediaTwo serial rapists were among 131 officers and staff in the Metropolitan Police who committed crimes or misconduct after they were not properly vetted, a review has found.David Carrick, one of the UK's worst sex offenders, and Cliff Mitchell, who carried out a \"campaign of rape\" on two victims, were among the police officers who were not properly checked.The cases were revealed in a vetting review of the 10 years up to the end of March 2023. Other serious crimes committed by officers and staff included drug use, violent attacks and affray.Assistant Commissioner Rachel Williams acknowledged that the \"public will be really concerned\" by the lapse in vetting procedures.She added that the report was part of \"ongoing work to demand the highest standards across the Met\".Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"Abandoning vetting checks on officers was a dereliction of the Met's duty to keep London safe.\"I have asked the Chief Inspector of Constabulary to carry out an inspection as I seek to restore trust in the force's ability to protect and serve the public.\"Met PoliceCliff Mitchell is serving a life sentence with a minimum term of nearly 18 years after committing more than 50 sex attacksCarrick, who was given 37 life sentences for his crimes, was not properly vetted in 2017, with checks failing to reveal an allegation of domestic abuse against him.Mitchell was allowed to join the force in 2020 after a vetting panel, which partly aimed to improve diversity, overturned a decision to reject him from the police despite a previous accusation of raping a child.The review published on Thursday found that thousands of police officers and staff were not properly checked amid pressure during a national recruitment drive from July 2019 to March 2023.Senior officers at the Met chose not to meet national guidelines amid a scramble to find more than 4,500 recruits.The deviations from standard practice meant thousands of references were not checked, and shortcuts in vetting led to there being some officers and staff who should not have been in the force. This contributed to \"police-perpetrated harm\" and damaged public trust, the review said.Under the Police Uplift Programme, forces in England and Wales were expected to recruit 20,000 officers within three and a half years to replace those cut during austerity, and funding was ringfenced and lost if targets were not met.Hertfordshire PoliceDavid Carrick was already serving multiple life sentences when he was convicted last year of further sex attacks\"Senior leaders embarked on an assertive approach towards hiring and vetting practices in order to meet what would become unachievable recruitment targets and grow the Metropolitan Police Service's (MPS) workforce at pace,\" the report stated. \"The focus appeared to be on speed and output; this unintentionally compromised integrity.\"The report said 5,073 officers and staff were not properly vetted, of whom 4,528 had no Special Branch vetting checks, 431 had no Ministry of Defence checks and 114 had a vetting refusal overturned by a Met internal panel. Another 3,338 who were due for vetting renewal underwent only limited checks.The Met estimated that about 1,200 people who joined the force may have had their vetting refused under normal practices, out of around 27,300 applications.Separately, 17,355 officers and staff did not have their references properly checked, if at all, between 2018 and April 2022.The Met has not checked each of these files, but estimates that about 250 of these employees would not have got a job if their references had been checked.'Farcical situation'The review found that senior officers had faced political pressure and had to meet recruitment targets or lose funding to other forces.The report concluded: \"There were deviations from policy and practice, overconfidence in the ability to recruit at scale and lack of resources in vetting increased risk.\"PA MediaSir Mark Rowley took up the role of Met Police Commissioner in September 2022 Since Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley took on the UK's top policing job in September 2022, about 1,500 officers have been sacked in what has been dubbed as a clean-up of the force.Williams said: \"In publishing this report today, we are being open and transparent about past vetting and recruitment practices that led, in some cases, to unsuitable people joining the Met.\"We have been honest with Londoners on many occasions about previous shortcomings in our professional standards approach. \"We found that some historical practices did not meet the strengthened hiring and vetting standards we have today. We identified these issues ourselves and have fixed them quickly while making sure any risk to the public has been properly and effectively managed.\"She added: \"The Met recruits hundreds of officers and staff every year, the overwhelming majority of exemplary character who are dedicated to protecting the public.\"Paula Dodds, chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: \"Today's report illustrates a farcical situation in which hitting a numerical target of recruits has taken precedence over normal checks and balances.\"The good, brave and hard-working colleagues we represent are the first to say that the small minority of officers who are not fit to serve should not be in the police service.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoShaimaa KhalilBBC News, JerusalemBBCAccording to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the warIn Gaza City, the sound of children learning can be heard once again.The tents that now serve as classrooms are noisy and a little chaotic but lively. Some teachers point to boards covered in English letters; others invite pupils to come forward and write basic Arabic words.It is nowhere near a normal school day. But after the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in October, it's a start.After two years of war, the hum of lessons and chatter of classmates resonates around the ruins of what was once Lulwa Abdel Wahab al-Qatami School, in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood in the south-western part of Gaza City.It was hit in January 2024, and for months afterwards, its grounds served as a shelter for displaced families. Today, it is again a place of learning - albeit in a more basic form.Walking in a straight line, their small arms resting on each other's shoulders, pupils smile as they head into the makeshift classrooms.For many, this is the first return to routine and education since the war began.According to Unicef, more than 97% of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed during the war. The IDF has made repeated claims that Hamas uses civilian infrastructure including schools to carry out operations but has rarely provided solid evidence. Of the Strip's 658,000 school-aged children, most have had no formal education for nearly two years. During that time, many learned first-hand how hunger, displacement and death can shape their young lives. Now, something rare is emerging: a fragile glimpse of the childhoods they once knew.For many children at this school, it's the first return to education since the war beganFourteen-year-old Naeem al-Asmaar used to attend this school before it was destroyed. He lost his mother in an Israeli air strike during the war.\"It was the hardest thing I've ever been through,\" he says quietly.Although he was displaced for months, Naeem's home in Gaza City survived. After the ceasefire, he returned with his family.\"I missed being in school a lot,\" Naeem said adding that the difference is stark.\"Before the war, school was in real classrooms,\"\"Now it's tents. We only study four subjects. There isn't enough space. The education is not the same - but being here matters. School fills all my time and I really needed that.\"Rital Alaa Harb, a ninth-grade student who once studied here too, wants to become a dentist.\"Displacement affected my education completely,\" she says. \"There was no time to study. No schools. I missed my friends so much - and I miss my old school.\"The makeshift school is run by Unicef and brings together children from the original Lulwa school and others displaced by the war.It does not teach the full Palestinian curriculum - only the basics: Arabic, English, mathematics and science.The principal, Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber, has worked in education for 24 years. He took over management of the site in mid-November.\"We started with determination,\" he said, \"to compensate students for what they lost.\"Dr Mohammed Saeed Schheiber says many of the children are struggling with traumaThe school currently serves 1,100 boys and girls, operating in three shifts a day - with boys attending on alternating days from girls. There are just 24 teachers.\"Before the war,\" Dr Schheiber says, \"our students learned in fully equipped schools - science labs, computer labs, internet access, educational resources. All of that is gone.\"There is no electricity here. No internet. And many children are struggling with trauma.More than 100 students at the school lost one or both parents, had their homes destroyed, or witnessed killings during the war. In total, Dr Schheiber says, every student has been affected - directly or indirectly.A counsellor now runs psychological support sessions, trying to help children process what they have endured.Despite the effort, demand far exceeds capacity.\"We have more than a thousand students here already,\" Dr Schheiber says. \"But only six classrooms per shift. There is a large displacement camp next to the school - families from northern and eastern Gaza. Many children want to enrol. We simply cannot take them.\"Many parents say their children have lost years of educationFor parents, the return to school brings relief as well as anxiety.Huda Bassam al-Dasouki, a mother of five displaced from southern Rimal, says education has become an overwhelming challenge.\"It's not that education doesn't exist,\" she says. \"It's that it's extremely difficult.\"Even before the war, schools struggled with shortages, she says. Now, basic supplies are unaffordable or unavailable.\"A notebook that cost one shekel ($0.31; £0.23) before the war now costs five,\" she says. \"I have five children.\"Some children, she says, have fallen four years behind, including time lost during the Covid pandemic.\"My son can't read. He can't write. He doesn't know how to copy from the board,\" she says.Jonathan Crickx says schools have been affected by restrictions on aid suppliesUnicef says the situation is made worse by restrictions on aid supplies entering Gaza.Standing outside one of the school tents, Jonathan Crickx, a Unicef spokesman, points to what is missing.\"Paper, notebooks, pens, erasers, rulers... we've been asking for a long time that these supplies can enter the Gaza Strip and they haven't been allowed in. It's the same for mental health and psychosocial recreative kits - toy kits that can be used to do mental health activities and recreational activities with the children,\" he says.An Israeli security official referred us to the prime minister's office, which did not respond to the BBC's questions.Israel says it is meeting its obligations under the ceasefire deal with Hamas and facilitating increased aid deliveries. The UN and multiple aid agencies dispute that, accusing Israel of continuing to restrict access to essential supplies.Despite the ceasefire, Israel's bombardment of Gaza continues - with almost daily strikes - in response to what it says are Hamas violations of the deal. Still, the children keep coming.For Kholoud Habib, a teacher at the school, that determination is telling.\"Education is our foundation,\" she says. \"As Palestinians, it is our capital.\"We lose homes. We lose money. We lose everything,\" she adds. \"But knowledge - knowledge is the one investment we can still give our children.\"",

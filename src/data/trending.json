It is an office that must be untainted by controversy or distraction.\"</p><p>The 54-year-old Dubliner added he knew the campaign would be \"robust and challenging\", however issues that have surfaced in recent days \"have given me cause to reflect\".</p></div><div><p>Gavin did not elaborate on the reason for his withdrawal in his statement. But his withdrawal followed a news report in the Irish Independent newspaper on Saturday alleging Gavin owed €3,300 (£2,870) to a former tenant.</p><p>Gavin was asked about the story on RTÉ's presidential debate on Sunday and said: \"If it happened, I'm very sorry that it happened. I'm looking into it and I will deal with it with urgency.\"</p><p>He added that he did not have \"all the information\" about the matter.</p></div><p></p><h2>Taoiseach supports withdrawal</h2><p></p><div><p>Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin said Gavin's decision to withdraw was \"the correct one\".</p><p>\"Jim has accepted that he made an error in relation to an issue that has arisen in recent days,\" he said.</p><p>\"He himself has said the office of Uachtarán na hÉireann is the highest in the land and the pinnacle of public service. He is clear that he does not want to bring controversy onto this office.\"</p><p>Martin added it was a \"very difficult decision\" for Gavin to withdraw given his \"commitment to public service\".</p></div><p></p><h2>Who is Jim Gavin?</h2><p></p><div><p>Gavin is a former Irish military pilot and a current aviation expert but he is best known for his successes as a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) football manager.</p><p>He managed the Dublin men's team from 2012 to 2019, when it won six All Ireland Senior Football Championship titles - five of which were back-to-back victories.</p><p>He had 20-year career in the Irish Air Corps and was later appointed as Chief Operations Officer of the Irish Aviation Authority.</p><p>Last month, Gavin said he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vzn723l92o\">had sent legal letters to some social media firms</a> after \"smears\" of a \"very personal nature\" were posted about him online.</p><p>He said online misinformation had \"become normalised\" in society and he was \"going to make a stand\" by contacting media regulators and social media platforms.</p></div></article>",

All 493 people have been released on bail, the Met Police said in an update on Sunday.</p><p>Organisers Defend Our Juries said around 1,000 took part in demonstrations around Trafalgar Square against the ban on the group and opposing Israel's actions in Gaza.</p><p>Following the Home Office announcement on protests the group posted on social media accusing the government of \"silencing opposition\" and \"authoritarianism\".</p><p>Responding to Mahmood's comments, Defend Our Juries said: \"It beggars belief that the government has responded to widespread condemnation of its unprecedented attack on the right to protest - from the United Nations, Amnesty International, legal experts and even the former director of public prosecutions - by announcing a further crackdown on free speech and assembly in our country.\"</p></div><div><p>Hundreds of people have been arrested since the group was outlawed by former home secretary Yvette Cooper in the summer,<b> </b>predominantly for holding signs saying they support Palestine Action.</p><p>Israel has repeatedly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and that its actions are justified as a means of self-defence following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack. </p><p>But last month the world's leading association of genocide scholars said that Israel's conduct <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o\">meets the legal definition as laid out in the UN convention on genocide</a>.</p><p>The arrests have been criticised by human rights group Amnesty International, which said arresting people for \"peacefully sitting down and holding these signs\" was not a job for the police.</p><p>On Sunday the charity said the powers were \"a reheat\" of a move by the previous Conservative government that had been found unlawful by the courts.</p><p>Tom Southerden, its UK law and human rights director, said the move bore no relation to Saturday's protests which had been in a new location.</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Activists applauded their fellow protesters as they were detained</figcaption><p></p><div><p>Organisers of Saturday's protest, Defend Our Juries, had been asked to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgy8kvvkp3o\">reconsider their plans</a> following the killing of two men at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur - the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar. </p><p>But organisers said in a statement beforehand it hoped police \"choose to prioritise protecting the public from real terrorism, and not waste resources on enforcing the absurd and ridiculous ban on Palestine Action\".</p><p>Former Tory MP and minister Dame Penny Mordaunt, who co-wrote a cross-party report on antisemitism, said there was \"no doubt\" some people at the rallies were \"violent antisemites stirring up hatred\", while Conservative Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen said those standing alongside them were \"useful idiots\".</p><p>Labour MP Lucy Powell called for a \"tougher regulatory regime\" to stop the spread of antisemitism online, where she said the spread was phenomenal.</p><p>Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz were killed after Jihad Al-Shamie drove a car into people outside synagogue in Manchester.</p><p>Al-Shamie then tried to force his way into the building before being shot dead by armed police. Three others were injured in the attack.</p><p>Several arrests have been made in relation to the attack and Mahmood said four people remained in custody on Sunday morning.</p><p>The home secretary will write to chief constables on Sunday to encourage them to use all their powers to prevent and respond to public disorder, as well as thanking them for their response following Thursday's attack.</p><p>Police forces are working with the Community Security Trust, a charity which works to protect Jewish people from terror and antisemitism, to reassure the Jewish community, the home office said.</p><p>On Sunday, the Board of Deputies of British Jews is holding a commemorative event ahead of Tuesday's second anniversary of the 7 October attacks on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>The group has welcomed the government's move to increase police powers and described recent protests as \"deeply irresponsible and offensive\".</p></div></article>",

A group calling itself <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gqepe5355o\">Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters has claimed responsibility.</a></p><p>About 30,000 people are directly employed at the company's plants with about 200,000 working for firms in the supply chain. Some of these firms supply parts exclusively to JLR, while others sell components to other carmakers as well.</p><p>Evtec Group is a so-called \"tier one\" supplier which provides parts directly to JLR, while sourcing the materials it needs from other companies lower down the supply chain. </p><p>It has 1,250 employees mostly based in the West Midlands, but much like JLR's factories, its main plants in Coventry and Kidderminster have been at a virtual standstill for weeks.</p><p>Machines have been shut down, parts set to be shipped out piled high and most staff sent home on 80% of their usual pay.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9707/live/3efd3970-a03c-11f0-a773-e3aaa8b51116.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Evtec Evtec's chairman David Roberts wearing a suit jacket and opened collared shirt.

There's a lot of vulnerable people out there who are now really concerned – the cost of living, Christmas coming up, when will they return to work in earnest?\"</p><p>Engineer Ben Brindley said the length of the disruption has fuelled fears about his job.</p><p>\"There's only so much refurbishment or decorating you can do whilst you're at home,\" he said.</p><p>\"The longer it goes on for, the more worried you get really. You start to think - will I have a job to come back to?\"</p><p>Experts have warned while production will gradually resume, the impact of the cyber-attack on JLR is not over.</p><p>The company said its recovery programme was \"firmly under way\" and that its global parts logistics centre, which supplies spare parts to dealerships for vehicle servicing, was \"returning to full operations\".</p><p>But when it comes to restarting carmaking, experts point out the process is not like flicking a switch. Some industrial processes can take days to get back up and running, while JLR has already said the restart will be done in phases. </p><p>Secondly, suppliers that have lost income during the shutdown may not be able to bounce back as quickly.</p></div><p></p><h2>'Toothless support'</h2><p></p><div><p>Andy Palmer, who has held senior roles at Nissan and was the former boss of Aston Martin, said the restart process would \"take a while\", and added the supply chain was \"broken and needs to be repaired\".</p><p>\"The other issue is the impact on suppliers. Some of them... might not make it, and if any of those fail then that's more disruption in the supply chain,\" he said.</p><p>While the government has agreed to back loans for JLR to support suppliers, Evtec's Mr Roberts said the policy was a \"toothless solution\".</p><p>\"It doesn't help the UK's advanced manufacturing sector one iota, because we don't see any of those funds,\" he said.</p><p>\"We asked the government directly, at ministerial level, to directly support the sector. They listened, but they did nothing. It's almost like they've turned a deaf ear to the needs of advanced manufacturing, which is a key platform of the Industrial Strategy\".</p><p>He said the government needed to support labour and payroll costs and provide tax reliefs for a period of time while firms recover.</p><p>\"Production will begin, but it's too late. All of our companies have had six weeks of zero sales and still had to pay their costs,\" Mr Roberts said.</p><p>The government has said it is in \"daily contact with JLR and cyber experts to listen to concerns and what support can be provided to get production back online.\"</p></div></article>",

He struggles with meeting people his own age, understanding his emotions and anxiety. Buddy likes to keep Reindeer Dog close to him.</p><p>After moving to London from Scotland in October 2024, Buddy's mum, Tunde, started applying for schools. She says she tried at least 11 schools but many of them didn't get back to her, and those that did said they were full or could not give Buddy extra support without an EHCP.</p><p>At the start of this year more than 638,000 EHCPs had been issued to children and young people in England, a 10.8% rise on the year before and an 80% increase in six years.</p><p>The increase is partly because parents and schools have got better at identifying children who have special educational needs, especially autism, as opposed to there being more children with Send.</p></div><div><p>It is the second time Buddy and Tunde have applied for an EHCP. Their first application was turned down before Buddy was assessed. Councils reject about a quarter of EHCP applications at the assessment stage, according to the Department for Education.</p><p>When they lived in Scotland, Tunde says they did not have to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP. Buddy's comprehensive school arranged support for his learning, although not for his emotional needs.</p><p>Scotland has a different system for helping children with Send; schools there aim to deliver more support without the need for parents to apply for the equivalent of an EHCP.</p><p>\"It's a madness,\" Tunde says. \"[Getting extra support] was so easily done, and it could be easily done again.\"</p><p>While Buddy is not able to go to school, the council is providing him with 19 hours of lessons per week in the local library.</p><p>Tunde tells me the process of applying for an EHCP has been so time consuming she had to stop working as a midwife and health visitor for a time.</p><p>\"I can't do the parenting. I can't get him to these appointments, and work at the same time… I couldn't get my son seen in the right amount of time and see other people's babies in the right amount time.

Speed, connected data and stakeholder simplicity should be key goals.\"</p><p>Paul Whitehead chief executive at Zoopla said: \"We look forward to working closely with government and the wider industry to modernise the homebuying process, so that buyers are given certainty earlier and to help reduce any unnecessary costs.\"</p><p>The announcement comes are the Conservatives are set to detail changes to its tax policy for first home buyers at the party's conference in Manchester.</p><p>The party will lay out plans to \"reward work\" by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo\">giving young people a £5,000 tax rebate towards their first home</a> when they get their first full time job.</p><p>The shadow chancellor Mel Stride will announce proposals for a \"first-job bonus\" that would divert national insurance payments into a long-term savings account.</p><p>The party say it will be funded by cuts to public spending worth £47bn over five years in areas such as welfare, the civil service and the foreign aid budget.</p></div>",

Moench</span><span></span></p></span></p></div><div><p>US President Donald Trump has urged everyone involved in efforts to end the Gaza war to \"move fast\" as mediators are set to meet in Egypt on Monday for indirect peace talks between Hamas and Israel.</p><p>The talks come after Hamas agreed to some parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including freeing hostages and handing over Gaza governance to Palestinian technocrats, but is seeking negotiations on other issues. </p><p>The group's response did not mention the key demands of its disarmament and playing no future role in Gaza's governance.</p><p>Writing on social media that talks had been \"very successful\", Trump said: \"I am told the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to move fast.\"</p></div><div><p>The US president added that \"time is of the essence or massive bloodshed will follow\".</p><p>Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump said he thought the hostages would start to be freed \"very soon\".</p><p>When asked about flexibility over his peace plan, Trump said \"we don't need flexibility because everybody has pretty much agreed to it, but there will always be some changes\".</p><p>\"It's a great deal for Israel, it's a great deal for the entire Arab world, Muslim world, and world, so we're very happy about it,\" he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continued in Gaza, despite Trump telling Israel to \"immediately stop the bombing\" on Friday after Hamas responded to the proposed plan.</p><p>Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian told reporters on Sunday that \"while certain bombings have actually stopped inside of the Gaza Strip, there's no ceasefire in place at this point in time\".</p><p>Bedrosian said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had given orders \"to fire back for defensive purposes... if there is a threat to their life in the battlefield in Gaza\".</p><p>Reports from Gaza say Israel continued air strikes and tank fire overnight and into Sunday, destroying a number of residential buildings in Gaza City.</p><p>A BBC correspondent heard explosions from inside Gaza and saw a plume of smoke while near the border in Kibbutz Be'eri, Israel, on Sunday morning.</p><p>Another 65 people were killed by Israeli military operations in the 24 hours leading up to midday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said.</p></div><div><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the BBC's US news partner CBS News that bombing needs to stop to facilitate a hostage release.</p><p>\"You can't release hostages while there's still bombardments going on... that has to stop, but you also have to work through the other logistics,\" he told CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday.</p><p>\"We want to get the hostages out as soon as possible,\" he added.</p><p>The 20-point plan proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of 48 hostages, only 20 of whom are thought to be alive, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.</p><p>Netanyahu said in a televised address on Saturday that he hoped to announce the release of hostages \"in the coming days\".</p><p>The prime minister has \"made it clear that in an agreement with the Trump administration talks will be confined to a few days maximum\", Bedrosian said.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">Read the full 20-point peace plan</a></li></ul><p>Netanyahu ordered the departure of the Israeli delegation on Monday for the crucial talks.</p><p>A Hamas delegation headed by chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ced58zywdwno\">one of the targets of an Israeli assassination attempt</a> in Doha, Qatar last month, was due to arrive in Cairo on Sunday night.</p><p>US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani will also attend.</p><p>The talks are expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war and could determine whether a path toward ending the conflict is finally within reach.</p><p>Many Palestinians described Hamas' response to the peace plan as unexpected, after days of indications that the group was preparing to reject or at least heavily condition its acceptance of Trump's peace plan proposal.</p><p>Instead, Hamas refrained from including its traditional \"red lines\" in the official statement, a move many interpret as a sign of external pressure.</p><p>A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators played a major role in convincing Hamas to tone down its objections and to leave contentious points such as the fate of its weapons, Gaza's post-war governance and its other concerns for the negotiation table.</p><p>Many Gazans warn that this tactical flexibility carries considerable risk.</p><p>Every additional day of delay means more deaths, destruction, and displacement for hundreds of thousands of Gazans.</p><p>Yet Hamas' decision to enter the talks without explicit preconditions could also be seen as a recognition of its limited leverage after nearly two years of war.</p><p>Trump, when asked by CNN's Jake Tapper what would happen if Hamas insists on staying in power in Gaza, responded in a text message that the group would face \"complete obliteration\".</p><p>The US president posted on social media that Israel had agreed to an initial withdrawal line in Gaza, the first in a proposed series of pull-backs by Israeli forces.</p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c5ykwny8dp9o\">BBC Verify: Unpicking Trump's Gaza peace plan map </a></li></ul><p>According to population distribution data in the Gaza Strip, the withdrawal map published by Trump would initially exclude nearly 900,000 Palestinians from returning to their homes.</p><p>The proposed lines carve out Rafah at the southernmost edge, Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahia in the north, nearly a quarter of Gaza City, and half of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah in the centre and south.</p><p>Hamas had rejected a similar map during previous rounds of talks in March and May this year.</p><p>The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p>Since then, 67,139 have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza, the health ministry says.</p><p>International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war, making verifying claims from both sides difficult.</p><p>For now, the region holds its breath as negotiators prepare to gather in Egypt, hoping that despite deep mistrust and political fragility this round might finally open the way toward a ceasefire.</p></div>",

But it seems worth noting that a year earlier, he'd made headlines across France after he'd told me, twice, in an interview, that he wanted to \"play down\" the seriousness of Gisèle Pelicot's ordeals because \"no-one was killed\", and no children were involved.</p><p>It is also worth noting that almost all the women we did speak to in Mazan last week did not share the mayor's desire to see the Pelicot case as, primarily, something to \"move beyond\".</p><p>Smoking a cigarette in a shaded doorway not far from the church, a 33-year-old civil servant, who gave her name as Aurélie, spoke with undisguised bitterness.</p><p>\"No-one talks about it anymore, even here in Mazan. It's as if it never happened. I know someone experiencing domestic violence right now. But women hide it. They're afraid of the men who do these things,\" she said, adding that she was \"certain\" that more of Gisèle Pelicot's rapists remained undetected, and at large, in the neighbourhood.</p><p>Walking nearby past a couple of sunbathing cats, Aurore Baralier, 68, was equally keen to talk, but took a different view of the Pelicot case.</p><p>\"The world is evolving. France is evolving.\" With Madame Pelicot's help? \"Yes. It's been a boost, for women to speak freely,\" she told me, emphatically.</p><p>Across France, there is no doubt that the publicity generated by Gisèle Pelicot's globally broadcast determination that \"shame should change sides\" - from victim to rapist – has provided added momentum to a campaign against sexual violence already energised by the MeToo movement.</p><p>\"I would say changing behaviour is something that takes generations. [But] the Pelicot case sparked a huge, historic mobilisation… against sexual violence, and against impunity,\" said Alyssa Ahrabare, who co-ordinates a network of 50 feminist organisations in France. \"We're focused on training professionals, supporting victims, on investigations.\"</p><p>\"Yes, France has changed. The [number of] complaints of rapes has tripled, showing that victims – women and girls – they speak up and they want justice,\" agreed Céline Piques, spokesperson for the NGO \"Dare to be feminist\".</p><p>And yet, the energy and optimism that engulfed Gisèle Pelicot last December, as she emerged from the Avignon courthouse and into a scrum of supporters, have not led to many substantive changes to the way the French state tackles the issue of sexual violence.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee6d/live/1fc44340-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A small traditional French church with a stone bell tower.

There is a backlash. Rape culture ideas are coming back very strongly. We can see this with the masculinist movement rising in popularity, especially with young boys and teenagers,\" added Alyssa Ahrabare, also citing the rise of deep-fake pornography.</p><p>In the midst of a financial and political crisis in France, with public debt soaring, and the country having five prime ministers in the past two years, the government has strongly defended its record, saying it has made \"decisive\" changes, including trebling spending in this field in the past five years - an \"unprecedented\" increase.</p><p>However, a scathing Senate report this summer concluded that the government was \"lacking a strategic compass\", when it came to tackling rape and other forms sexual violence. The Council of Europe has also been highly critical, recently, of France's efforts to protect women.</p><p>A well-placed source told us that even data about the number of rapes reported in France were unreliable due to an overly complex bureaucracy.</p><p>Occasionally, a news story will offer another small jolt of optimism.</p><p>In Dijon, a 60-year-old accused of drugging his wife for others to rape her, was arrested in August after one man, invited to participate, later called the police, having doubted \"her consent\".</p><p>The alleged victim's lawyer Marie-Christine Klepping told us she was \"sure\" that knowledge of the Pelicot case, and fear of being caught up in something similar, had prompted that phone call.</p><p>In May, the French film star Gérard Depardieu was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women in what many lawyers and activists hailed as a significant blow against a widely perceived culture of impunity enabling powerful men to abuse women.</p><p>\"It could mean something,\" Elodie Tuaillon-Hibon told the BBC, \"because he has been very protected, [even] by President Macron\", who appeared to defend the actor at one point. Ms Tuaillon-Hibon is a Paris-based lawyer who had previously been involved in prosecuting Depardieu.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e120/live/0f29c640-a04c-11f0-b687-23a5afa8b42e.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Elodie Tuaillon-Hibon is photographed on a balcony in Paris.

Hosting Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at the White House, he offered a solution designed to satisfy both sides.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f95f/live/13607840-9b00-11f0-8272-7f0194ae8142.jpg.webp\" alt=\"A bespectacled man looks ahead, standing in front of a winding river in a mountain valley\" /></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Marut Vanyan stands close to the Aras river that separates Armenia from Iran</figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>A future Trump route promises both \"unimpeded connectivity\" for Azerbaijan and \"full respect\" for Armenia's sovereignty.

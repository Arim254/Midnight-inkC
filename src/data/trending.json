    "body": "Jeremy Doku was absolutely brilliant for Manchester City in their 3-0 win on Sunday, but Liverpool's tactics were the reason he was able to run riot down their right.Without Mohamed Salah tracking back, Arne Slot's side were always so vulnerable down that flank and I felt sorry for Conor Bradley, who was trying to stop Doku but had Nico O'Reilly to worry about too.Even if Liverpool had found some better balance, and had a winger who gave Bradley more defensive support or condensed City's space, then with the way Doku was playing he would still have been almost impossible to stop.Doku was a pleasure to watch, irrespective of who you support and who you wanted to win. You had to admire his skill, pace, strength and bravery - and his goal was just amazing.The way Liverpool were set up, though, actually helped him shine.He was electric and the game's star man. This was the best I've seen him play in a City shirt, but Salah not being asked to defend made it so easy for him.It became a really productive area of the pitch for City, and was one of the reasons they won so comfortably in the end.'Liverpool ended up being pulled apart'Media caption, How 'electric' Doku helped Man City 'dismantle' LiverpoolI am really surprised Liverpool's potential problem down the right was not identified before the game.Since he broke into the team a year ago, O'Reilly has been a real positive for City from an attacking perspective and frequently ends up in left wing or even centre-forward areas.So City were always going to look for an overload from him and Doku down that flank, and it was down to Liverpool to deal with it.But because Salah stayed high up the pitch when O'Reilly was flying forward, it left Bradley isolated, and with a dilemma - did he commit and stick with Doku, or drop off him and pick up O'Reilly charging forward instead?Image caption, Salah staying so high meant Bradley (red circle, right) frequently had to deal with two City players - Doku (top blue circle) and O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running at himAs I explained on Match of the Day, Bradley was caught in between both players a lot because he was unsure what to do, but whatever he did it felt like there was always so much space over there for City to exploit.It was hard for Ryan Gravenberch to do much about it, because if he went out there too early he was only leaving space centrally instead, where the likes of Phil Foden and Rayan Cherki were looking for pockets to get on the ball.Ibrahima Konate tried to help Bradley too, but he was having to cover a lot of distance to get over to support his right-back, and being dragged across meant he left space behind him in the middle as well.Image caption, For the move that led to Doku's goal in the second half, Gravenberch cannot help Bradley (red circle, left) because he is picking up Foden centrally. The ball is played out to O'Reilly (bottom blue circle) running to the edge of the Liverpool area, who finds Doku in space to cut in and bend a beautiful shot into the corner of the netLiverpool ended up being pulled part and, like I say, they must have been aware it could happen before the game.The best opposition, with the best players, find your weakness. Chelsea deliberately targeted Liverpool down the right in the same way a few weeks ago, because they knew the problem with Salah existed - but Sunday turned into an even bigger expose of the issue.It is something that cannot go on. Liverpool cannot allow this to keep happening when they play the top sides, especially away from home where they see less of the ball and have less control of the game.Image caption, More than half of City's attacks came down their left, through Doku and O'Reilly. \"It's a very deliberate ploy,\" said Murphy on MOTD.Other things must have concerned Slot tooA lot of people will say that Liverpool have had success for years without Salah tracking back.While Salah did defend more under Jurgen Klopp, he spoke last season about not being given so much defensive responsibility by Slot and how much he was enjoying that. Let's remember Liverpool won the title with him playing that way.But there's a difference between never doing it and sometimes doing it. Last season, when Liverpool won at Etihad Stadium, Salah's defensive performance was among the best I've seen from him.This time, I think it was maybe down to him to look at how Bradley was having a tough time and decide 'I am going to help him out', even if it was just for 15 minutes or half an hour, to help Liverpool get back in the game.I am not saying Salah should now become a completely different player - you don't want him running back every time you lose the ball, because sometimes you want him ready for the transition where O'Reilly is out of position. Salah almost got in a few times like that on Sunday, because of his pace, but there has to be balance.In a game like this one, where you are 20 minutes in and Doku has been running your right-back ragged, then you could drop in for a spell even if you've been told you don't have to. I don't understand why he didn't do it at all.Image caption, Doku was the top player in the match for shots on target, touches in the opposition box, dribbles completed, duels won and fouls wonDecisions did not cost Liverpool the gameThat failure to try to fix things during the game was another disappointing part of Liverpool's display, but there were plenty of other things that must have concerned Slot too.Especially in the first half, they did not press particularly well. They lacked tenacity without the ball and seemed slow when they were in possession. In both areas, they were well below the level we saw in their previous two games against Aston Villa and Real Madrid.Now, of course they played a huge game on Tuesday against Real, one of the best teams in Europe, and put every bit of effort in to get a positive result.I get that, but City also played in the Champions League, a day later, so I don't believe Liverpool can use the Real game as an excuse.Media caption, Liverpool 'completely dominated' by Manchester City in first half, says SlotIf Virgil van Dijk's equaliser against City had been allowed to stand then I suppose things might have been different - Liverpool had started really poorly but moments like that can change momentum in games.I still think it was a poor decision, even when you break down the laws behind it, because Andy Robertson did not affect Gianluigi Donnarumma, but I would emphasise that decision did not cost Liverpool the game - City dominated them in all departments.Are Liverpool still in title race?Media caption, Guardiola beaming after win over Liverpool in 1,000th game as a managerThis result meant a good week for Slot ended badly, especially regarding the Premier League title race.The defeat is not quite as damaging as it could have been, because leaders Arsenal drew on Saturday and dropped points.But Liverpool are still eight points behind the Gunners and the biggest observation for me so far this season is that they are not consistently playing well enough to be able to think they can close that gap.This is a challenging time for Slot and his players but it is so early in the campaign, and there is plenty of time for them to bounce back and find some balance and rhythm, and cut out the mistakes.At the moment, though, all that feels like it is a long way off.City were not just the better team on Sunday who created the better chances, they were dominant for most of the game. Since their blip in August when they lost back-to-back games, they have looked really strong.At the moment Pep Guardiola's side are the ones who look most likely to compete with Arsenal for the title, while Liverpool need to find a way of becoming harder to beat.Danny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.",

    "body": "1 hour agoEPA/ ShutterstockFlight delays and cancellations continue to snarl US air travel for a third day as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned air traffic will be \"reduced to a trickle\" if the US government shutdown continues.More than 2,900 flights to, from, or within the US were cancelled and 8,600 delayed by late afternoon on Sunday, according to flight tracker FlightAware. The longest delays were reported in Newark, New Jersey – more than two hours on average.In a hopeful sign, lawmakers are working on a possible deal to reach a compromise on government funding and end the shutdown, according to US media reports. The Senate was scheduled to convene on Sunday in a rare weekend session.Duffy warned the impacts on air travel will grow dire if they do not break the stalemate soon.\"You're going to see air travel be reduced to a trickle,\" he said on CNN on Sunday. He added that travellers trying to fly home for the Thanksgiving holiday later this month may not be able to get there.\"Many of them are not going to be able to get on an airplane, because there are not going to be that many flights that fly if this thing doesn't open back up,\" he said.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced last week that it would be reducing air travel capacity by up to 6% this weekend and 10% by next weekend at 40 of the nation's busiest airports. The cuts do not apply to international flights, but some airlines may choose to also cancel some of those flights, the FAA said.Air traffic controllers, who are not being paid during the shutdown, are reportedly fatigued and not coming to work, triggering the reductions in air traffic allowances. Duffy said Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered to have military air traffic controllers step in to help but he declined the offer because they are not certified to direct air traffic at the civilian airports.Altogether, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not being paid since the Government ran out of money on 1 October. Food assistance for low-income Americans also has been in limbo, with the administration agreeing to pay only half of monthly benefits.   Sunday marked the 40th day of the longest shutdown in history as Republicans and Democrats still have not agreed on a funding resolution to reopen the government.The two parties have blamed each other for causing the impasse and for the travel disruptions. The White House said on Friday that Democrats were \"inflicting their man-made catastrophe on Americans just trying to make life-saving medical trips or get home for Thanksgiving\".Meanwhile, on Saturday Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of \"playing games with people's livelihoods\".Democrats have refused to back any Republican spending plan unless money for health insurance subsidies be included, while Republicans want to provide funding for the government without anything else attached.   US President Donald Trump suggested over the weekend money should be sent directly to Americans to buy health insurance rather than to insurance companies. Republican senators are working on a compromise package that could end the impasse with a vote to advance legislation possibly coming on Sunday.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterLisa Nandy: 'We didn't meet the highest standards - that is on me'The culture secretary has apologised for breaking rules by failing to declare she had received donations from the man she picked to run England's new football regulator.The commissioner for public appointments published a report on Thursday which found David Kogan had made two separate donations of £1,450 to Lisa Nandy when she was running to be Labour leader in 2020. Nandy told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \"We didn't meet the highest standards - that is on me.\"The Conservatives have said Nandy's actions were \"a serious breach of public trust\" and called for a further investigation into Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who also received donations from Mr Kogan. In a statement Mr Kogan said he had been asked to apply for the role by the previous Conservative government who had been aware that he was a Labour donor and had already appointed him to the board of Channel 4.“I committed to be completely politically impartial when the select committee interviewed me and have ended all connections with the Labour Party,” he added. He said the commissioner had not questioned his suitability for the position and that the Conservative chair of the culture committee had “endorsed me for the role provided I demonstrated political independence”.Mr Kogan, a sports rights executive, was initially longlisted for the football regulator role under the previous Conservative government.Nandy became involved in the process after Labour won the 2024 general election and she assumed the role of culture secretary.In April, she announced that Mr Kogan would be her preferred pick to fill the £130,000-a-year role.However, a month later she removed herself from the appointment process after Mr Kogan revealed to a parliamentary committee that he had donated \"very small sums\" to Nandy in 2020. Commissioner for public appointments Sir William Shawcross wrote in his report that Nandy had \"unknowingly\" breached the public appointments code and should have checked whether Mr Kogan had given her money before choosing him as her preferred candidate.The contributions were part of total donations worth £33,410 to Labour and the party's candidates in the five years prior to his appointment, the commissioner said.Mr Kogan's donations to Nandy were below declaration thresholds set by the Electoral Commission and by Parliament.Asked why she had not declared the donation during the appointments process, Nandy said she had not known about the money at the time it was given. She said that during her leadership campaign she had been \"out on the road\" doing hustings and interviews.\"I wasn't involved in fundraising for the campaign, and as soon as I found out I declared it and recused myself and I complied fully with the process.\"She insisted Labour was different from the Conservatives, saying: \"When we make mistakes – and we will make mistakes, we are human beings - we put ourselves through independent processes, we respect the outcome and we take the consequences.\"In his report, Sir William said: \"It need not be true that the donations actually influenced the secretary of state's decision-making – only that the risk of this perception should have been mitigated by declaration of this financial interest.\"He found the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had breached public appointment rules by failing to declare Mr Kogan's previous donations to Labour when he was named as the government's preferred choice for the job.The department also breached the rules by not discussing the donations to Nandy when Mr Kogan was interviewed for the job, Sir William found.After the report was published, Nandy wrote a letter to the prime minister saying: \"I deeply regret this error. I appreciate the perception it could create.\"In his reply, Sir Keir wrote: \"I know you to be a person of integrity and on the basis of your letter, it is clear you have acted in good faith.\"In May 2024, Mr Kogan donated £2,500 to the prime minister's local Labour branch of Holborn and St Pancras.The Conservatives have asked the government's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to investigate whether Sir Keir's role in Mr Kogan's appointment broke ministerial rules on transparency. Downing Street said Sir William had already carried out an extensive review and \"found no breaches aside from those set out in the report\".The football regulator role was set up following a fan-led review into the management of football clubs. The regulator has been tasked with improving the financial sustainability of clubs and safeguarding \"the heritage of English football\". ",

    "body": "Three people died and 15 more were injured after powerful waves battered popular Spanish holiday island Tenerife. A woman died after being pulled into the ocean near the the Puerto de la Cruz resort and a man died at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, emergency services said on Sunday. A third man was found dead in the ocean near a beach in Granadilla.Emergency services have told the public to stay away from coastal paths and to avoid taking pictures and videos of the rough seas, as the turbulent weather continues. Rescue services said they airlifted a man who fell into water at La Guancha in the north of the island, but that he was later pronounced dead at hospital. They said another man died after he was found floating near a beach at El Cabezo in the south, with lifeguards and medical staff unable to resuscitate him. At Puerto de la Cruz, a holiday resort in northern Tenerife, one woman died of a heart attack and another 10 people were swept out to sea. Three of those were seriously injured and taken to hospital.A local waiter, who gave his name only as Pedro, told the Reuters news agency that he jumped into the water in an attempt to save people being swept out. \"As soon as I saw a man waving at me I took my clothes off, jumped to the water and I managed to grab three of them and save them. I couldn't save the woman because she passed away at that moment,\" he said. Eyewitness Carlos said he warned people taking photos to move away from the waves but \"they did not pay attention\".Officials say the Canary Islands, the Spanish archipelago Tenerife belongs to, are on alert for coastal hazards. They warned sea conditions are expected to worsen with swells reaching two-to-four metres, and tourists and locals should exercise \"extreme caution\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoGeorge Wright and Andre Rhoden-PaulReutersIDF soldier Hadar Goldin was killed in Gaza in 2014Israel has received the body of Lt Hadar Goldin, a soldier killed in an ambush by Hamas in 2014 and whose body has been held in Gaza since then.The Israeli military said Lt Goldin, who was 23 when he died, was formally identified and will now be buried. He left behind parents, a sister, two brothers, and a fiancée.Hamas's armed wing had said on Sunday that it would hand over Lt Goldin's body as part of a ceasefire deal.Hamas has now returned all 20 living hostages, and 24 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of the deal.On Sunday, Lt Goldin's father Simcha Goldin said in a statement: \"Victory means bringing home the hostages and bringing home our soldiers to Israel.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog both said they had kept a picture of Lt Goldin in their offices for the past 11 years. Netanyahu said \"we didn't give up\" on bringing him home.\"I know the agony that his family's been through, I know the longing for his return that united the people of Israel and today we're united in bringing him finally to his parents, to his family, to a grave in Israel.\"Efforts to retrieve Lt Goldin \"involved extensive intelligence efforts, alongside operational activities on the ground\" over the past decade and during the last two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.The military expressed \"deep condolences to the family and continues to make every effort to return all the deceased hostages and is prepared for the continued implementation of the agreement\".Herzog said the government would \"continue to act tirelessly\" to bring home all the hostages.Of the four hostages who remain in Gaza, three are Israeli and one is Thai.ReutersLt Goldin, from Kfar Saba, is the only deceased hostage whose remains were being held in Gaza before the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked the latest war. He was killed in combat on 1 August 2014, not long after the start of a ceasefire in that year's war between Israel and Hamas. He was among a group of Israeli soldiers patrolling an agricultural area near Rafah in southern Gaza when they were attacked by a group of Hamas fighters. The Israeli military determined that Lt Goldin was killed along with two other soldiers in a firefight, and that his body was then dragged into an underground tunnel by the Hamas fighters.The Israeli military unleashed massive firepower to try to prevent Hamas from taking Lt Goldin hostage. Scores of Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombardment of Rafah, which continued for four days, including after Lt Goldin was declared dead.Nine years later, the Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. At least 69,176 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.During the ongoing first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Before Lt Goldin's body was returned, Israel had also handed over the bodies of 300 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of 20 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.On Saturday in Gaza, two Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire. The Israeli military said two people had crossed the yellow line marking the line of Israeli control and posed an \"immediate threat\".Separately, one Palestinian was shot dead in Gaza by Israeli fire and another was wounded on Saturday, local medics and the Israeli military said.Gazan medical officials said the person who died was killed by Israeli fire east of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. Civil defence rescuers said the injured Palestinian was wounded by Israeli gunfire in Khan Younis.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Gaza health ministry.",

    "body": "10 hours agoRumeana JahangirNorth WestTwo care workers have been charged with the ill-treatment of four people at a mental health unit which featured in an undercover BBC investigation.The Panorama programme, broadcast in 2022, revealed that patients were humiliated and bullied at the Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, Greater Manchester.Support worker Sheryl Price, 45, of Eldergreen Close in Bolton, faces 14 charges, while 42-year-old nurse Sara Coleman, of Mitford Street in Stretford, is accused of five. Both have been bailed and are due to appear at Manchester Magistrates' Court on 25 March.A undercover Panorama reporter filmed staff at the Edenfield Centre - one of the UK's biggest mental health hospitals - using restraint inappropriately and patients enduring long periods of seclusion in small, bare rooms.Staff swore at patients and on occasion were seen slapping or pinching them.Some workers were sacked after the BBC's findings were broadcast.The programme sparked an independent report, which found Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust repeatedly missed opportunities to act on concerns and had a culture of \"suppressing bad news\".The trust was again rated \"inadequate\" by the Care Quality Commission earlier this year despite some improvements having been made.Criticisms included issues with patient safety and pressures on staff, with some still feeling unable to speak up about their concerns.The Edenfield site has since been rebranded as the Riverside Centre.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKathryn Armstrong, André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"Typhoon Fung-wong has made landfall in the Philippines, where more than 900,000 people have been evacuated and two people have died.The storm hit as a super typhoon, with sustained winds of around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph).The eye of the storm hit Aurora province in Luzon - the country's most populous island - at 21:10 local time (13:10 GMT). By 02:00, the storm weakened to a typhoon and was over La Union in western Luzon.The country's meteorological service warned of destructive winds and \"high-risk of life-threatening\" storm surges from the \"very intense\" typhoon.Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after earlier storm Kalmaegi left  nearly 200 people dead.Eastern parts of the Philippines had already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds on Saturday evening, a weather official said. Residents in Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.The storm passed near the eastern Bicol region on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon.The civil defence office reported that one person drowned and firefighters recovered the body of a woman trapped under debris in Catbalogan City. The civil aviation regulator has closed several airports, and almost 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong was expected to weaken after making landfall, but is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.More than 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, with even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  CHARISM SAYAT/AFP via Getty ImageA landslide-hit residential area in Guinobatan town, Albay province, south of ManilaIn the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceIn central Aurora, more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Philippines in 2013. \"We felt very worried because of the strength of the typhoon, and we have young children to think of,\" Jessa Zurbano told the BBC.Another evacuee Patry Azul said: \"Our house is made of wood and flimsy materials. We live close to the sea so we didn't feel safe.\"Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"How do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "In the three weeks since the Louvre museum heist, as investigators sought to find out who was behind it and why the French crown jewels had been so easy to steal, another mystery remained: who the \"fedora man\" was.The dapper youth in a hat was photographed outside the museum that Sunday and went viral on social media, prompting theories about his identity.Police moved swiftly to arrest and charge four people for the crime, while the Louvre director admitted CCTV security was inadequate.However, the fedora man remained an enigma - until now.The dandy, it turns out, is a local teenage fan of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot who just happened to be at a real crime scene.Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, a 15-year-old from Rambouillet, south-west of Paris told the Associated Press (AP) news agency that he had planned to visit the Louvre with his family but found the museum was closed. \"We didn't know there was a heist,\" he said.As he asked officers about the closure, an AP photographer seeking to capture the security cordon took a picture and included Pedro in the frame.Pedro only realised the photo had gone viral four days later, when a friend sent him a screenshot asking: \"Is that you?\"When he replied that it was, the friend said he had five million views on TikTok. \"I was a bit surprised,\" Pedro told the AP.He was even more shocked when his mother called to say the picture had appeared in The New York Times. It made a big impact on him, he said, because he reads that newspaper and \"it's not every day you're in the New York Times\". \"People said, 'You've become a star'. I was astonished that just with one photo you can become viral in a few days.\"Asked why he wore an old-fashioned waistcoat and a fedora to the museum, Pedro said he began dressing this way recently, inspired by 20th-century statesmen and fictional detectives.\"I like to be chic,\" he told the AP. \"I go to school like this.\"As wild speculation about the photo of him circulated online - some wondered whether he might be a real detective or an AI fake - Pedro remained silent for weeks.\"I didn't want to say immediately it was me,\" he said. \"With this photo there is a mystery, so you have to make it last.\"",

    "body": "12 hours agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"Britain is providing military support to Belgium after a series of suspected Russian drone incursions into its airspace, the new chief of the defence staff has said.Sir Richard Knighton told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart had asked for assistance earlier this week and that equipment and personnel were now on the way.Brussels Airport was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also seen in other locations, including a military base.It follows a series of drone incursion over several Nato nations that disrupted air travel. Russia has denied accusations of conducting \"hybrid warfare\" on allies of Ukraine.Sir Richard said it was not known for sure if the incursions were by Russia, but that it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.Defence Secretary John Healey said in a statement: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Members of the RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing are likely to be deployed, the BBC understands.Alongside Nato allies, Sir Richard added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\". The German defence ministry said on Friday that it too would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by Thursday's disruption, with the carrier saying it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia of being behind the incursion, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken previously indicated there was no evidence to suggest this.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Instagram/Royal Air Force RegimentThe RAF's 2 Force Protection Wing was deployed in an anti-drone role to the Paris Olympics in 2024Sir Richard said Russia was, broadly speaking, \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts.\"He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare was an area in which \"we [the UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and currently controls around a fifth of its territory, including the Crimean peninsula that it annexed in 2014.Hybrid threats use a mix of military and non-military tactics and are designed to interfere with infrastructure or institutions, according to Nato. The shadow defence secretary welcomed the decision to assist Belgium, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and that a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".The incursion into Belgian airspace follows similar incursions across European nations including Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. All are Nato allies that have provided support to Ukraine.While some have pointed the finger at Russia, officials have not produced evidence linking the incursions to Moscow, while the Kremlin has consistently denied any involvement.Suspicions have been fuelled by more overt airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe in recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones. Mocow has denied these were intentional.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to EU-wide discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEimear DevlinBBC Money Box reporterThe UK's tax body is reviewing its decisions to strip child benefit from about 23,500 claimants after it used travel data to conclude they had left the country permanently.Normally the benefit runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK, but many people affected complained that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time.The move came after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee demanded answers from the tax authority.HMRC has apologised for any errors and says anyone who thinks their benefits have been stopped incorrectly should contact them.A government spokesperson said: \"We're very sorry to those whose payments have been suspended incorrectly. \"We have taken immediate action to update the process, giving customers one month to respond before payments are suspended. We remain committed to protecting taxpayers' money and are confident that the majority of suspensions are accurate.\"In September, the government began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over five years.The new system allows HMRC records to be compared with Home Office international travel data, and the tax authority had used this data to stop payments to thousands of families.But it is now reviewing all of the cases following a growing number of complaints from people affected who said they had been on holiday, and had returned to the UK after a short time.Eve Craven went on a five-day break with her son to New York. She told the BBC's Money Box programme that about 18 months after the trip she received a letter saying the child benefit for her son had been stopped.The letter cited her trip to the US, saying it had no record of her return.\"It gave me a month basically to give them all the requested information to prove that I'd come back to the UK,\" she said.\"It's just a very big ask for something that they've messed up on, and they should have been able to sort out themselves.\"Eve's child benefit has now been reinstated with missing payments backdated.The issue was first identified in Northern Ireland, where some families had flown out of the UK from Belfast, but then returned to Dublin – which is in the EU - before driving home over the border.UK and Irish citizens can travel freely into each other's countries under the Common Travel Area arrangement.There are no routine passport checks when travelling through the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, meaning the UK government has no data to show that someone may have returned to Northern Ireland.It is not clear how many errors have been made in total, or how.HMRC told Money Box it would be reviewing all past cases \"using PAYE data and where continued UK employment is found, will be reinstating payments and making any back payments necessary\".It is aiming to complete its review by the end of next week.MPs on the Treasury Select Committee are also now investigating.Additional reporting by Nick Edser",

    "body": "Two pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians have been accused of taking bribes to rig pitches they threw at Major League Baseball games.The pitchers, Emmanuel Clase de la Cruz and Luis Leandro Ortiz Ribera, have been charged in connection to the sports betting and money laundering scheme, federal prosecutors and the FBI announced on Sunday.Prosecutors allege that the scheme drew hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal wagers.\"The defendants' alleged greed not only established an unfair advantage for select bettors, but also sullied the reputation of America's pastime,\" FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher Raia said in a statement. The two players have denied any wrongdoing. The indictment alleges that Mr Ortiz and Mr Clase co-ordinated in advance with co-conspirators, allowing the co-conspirators and sometimes themselves, to place hundreds of fraudulent bets at online sportsbooks. Prosecutors say Mr Clase, who they allege joined the scheme around May 2023, and Mr Ortiz, who they allege joined around June 2025, each received kickbacks or bribes from the bettors in exchange for the advanced information. For example, before a game on 27 June 2025, bettors paid Mr Ortiz $7,000 to throw a rigged pitch and paid Mr Clase the same amount for arranging the rigged pitch, prosecutors allege. Prior to the game, Mr Clase took out $50,000 in cash and gave $15,000 to a co-conspirator who used it to bet on the pitch, the indictment alleges.In total, Mr Ortiz's rigged pitches helped his co-conspirators win at least $60,000 from the illegal wagers, while Mr Clase's helped his co-conspirators bring in at least $400,000, prosecutors allege. \"The defendants deprived the Cleveland Guardians and Major League Baseball of their honest services. They defrauded the online betting platforms where the bets were placed,\" US Attorney Joseph Nocella, Jr, alleged in a press release. \"When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us,\" Mr Nocella added.Mr Ortiz was arrested in Boston on Sunday, and Mr Clase is not currently in US custody, authorities said. Both players had been placed on non-disciplinary paid leave over the summer while during an MLB investigation involving sports gambling.The two have been charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery, and money laundering conspiracy.In a statement, the Cleveland Guardians said it is fully cooperating with law enforcement and the league in their probes. Luis Ortiz's lawyer, Chris Georgalis, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that his client \"is innocent of the charges related to two pitches he threw\".\"He has never, and would never, improperly influence a game—not for anyone and not for anything,\" Mr Georgalis told CBS. The BBC has also contacted Mr Clase's representative, Kelvin Nova.While the investigation into Mr Clase was still ongoing prior to the indictments, Mr Nova told Cleveland.com that his client \"told me he doesn't bet\".Both The charges come just weeks after the FBI announced dozens of arrests in connection to two similar sports betting and money laundering schemes that involved a professional NBA player and coach as well as members of New York crime families.

    "body": "5 hours agoAnnabel Rackham and Emma Saunders,Culture reportersTim Davie's resignation as the BBC's top boss brings to an end his 20-year career at the corporation.He stepped down on Sunday after saying \"mistakes were made\" following criticism a Panorama documentary misled viewers by editing a speech by US President Donald Trump.The 58-year-old reached the top of the organisation in June 2020, when he was named the BBC's 17th director general.At the time of his appointment, he said: \"I have a deep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality,\" and when he took the helm, said one of his top priorities would include negotiating with the government over the future of the licence fee.One of the BBC's longest-serving executives, he first joined the broadcaster from Pepsi to become director of the Marketing, Communications & Audiences division in 2005.He then took over responsibility for radio stations including Radios 1, 2, 3 and 4 as director of the Audio & Music division in 2008.A month after being named chief executive of the corporation's commercial arm BBC Worldwide in 2012, he stepped in to become acting director general after the resignation of George Entwistle.Davie returned to BBC Worldwide after Tony Hall was appointed as George Entwistle's permanent successor, with Davie overseeng the merger of BBC Worldwide with the BBC's production arm to form BBC Studios in 2018.After landing one of the most high-profile jobs in Britain - and globally - his tenure as director general saw huge challenges.Former BBC media editor Amol Rajan described the job as \"hellish\" when Davie first took over.And while Davie has won praise for successfully overseeing the BBC's move towards digital, putting measures in place to change its workplace culture and focusing on boosting the BBC's commercial success, overall, it's not been an easy ride.In 2024, the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after he admitted charges of making indecent images of children.Davie told the press in September last year that there was \"shock\" and \"a lot of upset\" within the BBC over Edwards, who had been the BBC's highest-paid journalist.There was also controversy over comments made online by former Match of the Day host Gary Lineker.Lineker left the BBC sooner than planned in May 2025 after sharing a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult.Davie said at the time of Lineker's exit that the former footballer had \"acknowledged the mistake made\" but thanked the presenter and former footballer for \"his passion and knowledge\" in sports journalism.Further scrutiny over his leadership came over the summer, as more unwelcome headlines dogged the corporation.There was a crisis at BBC flagship series MasterChef, after both of its presenters - Gregg Wallace and John Torode - were sacked following a report which upheld allegations against them.Asked about poor workplace culture as he faced questions from the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, Davie said he thought \"we're at a moment in society where we're calling it out\".Davie added he was \"not letting anything lie\" when it came to rooting out abuses of power within the corporation.The spotlight also fell on Saturday night stalwart Strictly Come Dancing, with Davie apologising to contestants after complaints of abusive behaviour on the show.The BBC has also faced strong criticism for a live broadcast of Bob Vylan's performance at the Glastonbury festival, during which the band's singer led crowds in chants of \"death, death to the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]\" and made other derogatory comments.Davie said that what had happened was \"deeply disturbing\", adding: \"The BBC made a very significant mistake broadcasting that.\"He said that he had done the \"right thing\" at the time, by pulling it off the iPlayer and that the measures which have since been put in place would \"categorically prevent what happened\".Davie also said he thought the corporation made the \"right decision\" to not air Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, a controversial documentary which was later picked up by Channel 4.The BBC shelved the programme due to impartiality concerns it had surrounding the production.Earlier in the year, a separate documentary, Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, was pulled from iPlayer after it was found that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official.The film, made by independent production company HOYO Films, was later found by a review to have breached editorial guidelines on accuracy.The BBC board also had to apologise over \"missed opportunities\" to tackle \"bullying and misogynistic behaviour\" by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood.An independent report into what the BBC knew about Mr Westwood's conduct was published in February, highlighting a series of incidents and allegations it said amount to a \"considerable body of evidence\" which it failed to investigate properly.Westwood, who has always denied claims of misconduct, has since been charged with four counts of rape.Davie's tenure also included overseeing cuts to BBC local services which he defended as being \"the right thing\", but admitted were \"very difficult and unpopular\".He's also had to deal with issues surrounding equal pay at the BBC.It was only six months ago, in a speech to civic and community leaders in Salford, that Davie insisted the BBC could help tackle a \"crisis of trust\" in British society.He set out measures he said would allow the broadcaster to play a leading role in reversing a breakdown in trust in information and institutions, as well as tackling division and disconnection between people.But in his resignation letter on Sunday, Davie said \"the BBC is delivering well but there have been some mistakes made and as director general I have to take ultimate responsibility\".BBC chairman Samir Shah described Davie as \"a devoted and inspirational leader and an absolute believer in the BBC and public service broadcasting\".\"He has achieved a great deal,\" Shah added. \"Foremost, under his tenure, the transformation of the BBC to meet the challenges in a world of unprecedented change and competition is well under way.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorA look back at how Tim Davie dealt with BBC scandals over the yearsThis is seismic. To lose both the director general and the CEO of BBC News at the same time is unprecedented. It's an extraordinary moment in the history of the BBC.It can't be underestimated.On the face of it, Tim Davie's resignation makes some sense.I have wondered for some time whether he was weighing up how much longer he wanted to stay in a job that is highly pressurised. There have been occasions when I have interviewed him this year, as the controversies mounted, and he didn't seem his usual Tigger-ish self.In his resignation statement he referenced \"the very intense personal and professional demands of managing this role over many years in these febrile times\". My assessment is that the latest controversy felt one too many after a succession of crises (two Gaza documentaries, the Bob Vylan Glastonbury issue amongst them) and he didn't have enough oil in the tank for another fight.As former head of BBC comms, John Shield put it to me \"the DG job is one of the hardest in public life\". \"It has been relentless for him. He is a very capable leader who has driven real change, but at some point it becomes unsustainably attritional.\"I'm told there was still real shock when Tim Davie shared his decision with colleagues over the weekend.Deborah Turness' statement makes clear she has resigned on a point of principle. With the ongoing controversy around the President Trump Panorama causing damage to the BBC, she said \"the buck stops with me - and I took the decision to offer my resignation to the director general last night\".But, as with any resignation, and certainly with two, I can't help thinking there is more to this than meets the eye. And there is another story emerging about the functionality and make up of the BBC Board and its role in what has happened.It appears there has been a rift between the Board and the news division with some arguing the BBC has, for too long, failed to address institutional bias inside the BBC and others questioning whether what's unfolded has been an orchestrated - and politicised - campaign against the corporation which has claimed two big scalps.For the best part of a week, since the Telegraph first broke its story, I haven't been able to understand why the BBC did not get on the front foot in the face of a deluge of damaging headlines about claims of systemic bias.It needed to divide the allegations into two distinct stories. The first, about the edit of the Trump speech in the Panorama programme, needed addressing immediately. Either with a swift apology - or indeed a case made for why the BBC believed it had not mischaracterised the president's words.That would have allowed the BBC to come out fighting more widely on behalf of its journalism. Remember, it was being accused of institutional bias. Of a lack of impartiality. Accusations that cut to the heart of its news operation.With an apology for the mistake around the Panorama (or a robust defence), it could have gone on to try to refute the other claims about institutional bias. It could have said that the BBC had already been taking action to ensure editorial impartiality, and had already acted, for example, on issues at BBC Arabic.Instead the BBC allowed the story to fester - and we ended up in a situation where the Trump White House was calling the BBC \"fake news\" and it had some traction.My understanding from multiple sources inside the BBC is that a statement on Panorama had been ready to go for days. The BBC planned to say on the Trump edit that it hadn't intended to mislead the public, but that in light of looking at it again, it believed there should have been some kind of white flash or wipe, to make clear to audiences that these were two distinct parts of the speech.I understand Deborah Turness became more and more angry and frustrated as the week went on because she was prevented by the Board from putting out that apology.Instead the BBC Board decided a letter to the Culture Media and Sport Committee was the way to go. (Others have told me it's not as clearcut as this characterisation. That it took some time for news bosses to accept the Panorama edit had been an error and that there were discussions on all sides on how to respond.)Tim Davie pictured in 2016, before he took over as director generalMany, both inside and outside the BBC, see the failure to respond as a grave mistake. The Telegraph's drip feed of allegations was damaging - and the BBC wasn't tackling them head on.I have been told that Turness then went into a board meeting on Thursday to discuss the crisis around the Telegraph stories and was \"ripped apart\", as some have described it.Those who have called the BBC's journalism into question would call that accountability.But another source characterised it as the culmination of a \"relentless critique of BBC journalism over two years by members of the Board and advisers - all of whom come from same political persuasion\".They point to Robbie Gibb, a former BBC editor who left to become Downing St director of communications for Theresa May and who is now a member of the Board.The former Sun editor, now BBC presenter David Yelland has called it \"nothing short of a coup\". He claims the BBC Board has been undermined and \"elements close to it have worked with hostile newspaper editors, a former PM and enemies of public service broadcasting\".But another former Sun editor, Kelvin MacKenzie, had a very different take. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, he said the resignations were \"the right thing to do - this was an issue that was never going away\".The editing of the speech, he said, could have led to Trump suing or the BBC being banned from the White House. \"If you can't be trusted on that [the speech of the US president] what can you be trusted on?\" he said.And the US president himself has weighed into the debate for the first time. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he celebrated the resignations and accused the BBC of \"doctoring\" his speech and \"trying to step on the scales of a presidential election\".I'm struck by a line in Tim Davie's statement. He said this about the BBC: \"We should champion it, not weaponise it.\"Tonight, some are asking whether the resignations of both the director general and the CEO of News suggests the BBC has been weaponised.",

    "body": "3 hours agoParham GhobadiBBC PersianEPAIran - especially its capital, Tehran - is facing an unprecedented drought this autumn, with rainfall at record lows and reservoirs nearly empty. Officials are pleading with citizens to conserve water as the crisis deepens.President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned that if there is not enough rainfall soon, Tehran's water supply could be rationed. But he said that even rationing might not be enough to prevent a disaster.\"If rationing doesn't work,\" Pezeshkian said, \"we may have to evacuate Tehran.\"His comments have prompted criticism in Iranian newspapers and on social media. Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi called the idea \"a joke\" and said \"evacuating Tehran makes no sense at all\".Iran's meteorological officials say no rainfall is expected over the next 10 days.Meanwhile, the water crisis is already affecting daily life in the capital.\"I'm planning to buy water tankers to use for toilets and other necessities,\" a woman in Tehran told BBC Persian.In the summer, Iranian rapper Vafa Ahmadpoor posted a video on social media showing a kitchen faucet with no running water.\"It's been four or five hours,\" he said. \"I've bought bottled water just to be able to go to the toilet.\"Dams nearly emptyThe manager of the Latian Dam, one of Tehran's main water sources, says it now holds less than 10% of its capacity. The nearby Karaj Dam — which supplies water to both Tehran and Alborz provinces — is in a similarly dire condition.\"I have never seen this dam so empty since I was born,\" an elderly local resident told Iranian state TV.According to Mohammad-Ali Moallem, the manager of the Karaj Dam, rainfall has plummeted dramatically.\"We had a 92% decrease in rain compared to last year,\" he said. \"We have only eight per cent water in our reservoir — and most of it is unusable and considered 'dead water.'\"Fears of water cutsThe government is now pinning its hopes on late autumn rain, but forecasts are bleak. Iran's Minister of Energy, Abbas Ali Abadi, has warned the situation could soon force authorities to cut water supplies.\"Some nights we might decrease the water flow to zero,\" he said.Officials have also announced plans to penalise households and businesses that consume excessive amounts of water.ABEDIN TAHERKENREH/EPA/ShutterstockThe government has warned that it may have to restrict water supplies if the weather remains dry Pipes, war damage - and a widening crisisIran's energy minister Ali Abadi has said Tehran's water crisis is not only due to a lack of rainfall. He blamed water leakage caused by the capital's century-old water infrastructure and even pointed to the recent 12-day war with Israel.During that conflict, Israel targeted the northern Tehran neighbourhood of Tajrish on 15 June. Afterwards videos showed heavy flooding in the area.The day after the strike, the Israel Defence Forces said it had targeted Iranian military \"command centres\".But the crisis extends far beyond the capital.The head of Iran's National Centre for Climate and Drought Crisis Management, Ahmad Vazifeh, has warned that, apart from Tehran, dams in many other provinces — including West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan and Markazi — are also in a \"worrying state\", with water levels in the single-digit percentages.In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, officials are sounding the alarm as well.The Governor of Khorasan Razavi Province in north-east Iran, said the water reserves in Mashhad's dams have dropped to \"less than eight percent,\" warning that the province faces a \"mega-challenge of drought.\"CEO of Mashhad's Water and Wastewater Company put the figure even lower.\"The storage level of the city's main dam is below three percent,\" Hossein Esmaeilian said.\"Only three percent of the combined capacity of Mashhad's four water-supplying dams — Torogh, Kardeh, Doosti, and Ardak — remains. Apart from Doosti Dam, the other three are out of operation.\"A crisis long foreseen Iran's water crisis has been decades in the making.Even Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly acknowledged the looming threat — speaking about water shortages in his Nowruz addresses in 2011 and on other occasions in the following years.Yet little has changed.Today, Tehran, Karaj and Mashhad — home to more than 16 million people combined — are facing the real possibility of their taps running dry.",

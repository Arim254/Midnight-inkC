Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).\nAnnouncing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\". Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Victoria and Chris discuss what the review could mean\nPlus, President Trump has filed, what is being reported as, a $5 billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC. Caitríona Perry and the FT’s global media editor Daniel Thomas explain what’s in the lawsuit and why the BBC has said it plans to fight it. \nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.

    "body": "The Metropolitan and Greater Manchester police forces have said they will arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase 'globalise the intifada' - an Arabic word for uprising. In a statement following Sunday's mass shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, they said: \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed - words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests\".The two forces also referenced the Manchester synagogue attack in October. The UK's chief rabbi described the decision as \"an important step towards challenging the hateful rhetoric we have seen on our streets, which has inspired acts of violence and terror\".The police forces said: \"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalise the intifada' and those using it at future protests or in a targeted way should expect\" the two forces \"to take action\".\"Frontline officers will be briefed on this enhanced approach. We will also use powers under the Public Order Act, including conditions around London synagogues during services,\" the statement said.Visible patrols and protective security measures around synagogues, schools, and community venues have been stepped up in London and Greater Manchester.Fifteen people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Sunday's Bondi attack, which targeted Australia's Jewish community at an event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.Two people died in the knife attack at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue on 2 October.Criticising the decision by the police forces on Wednesday, Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal described the move as \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights\". He said police did not consult with the coalition that organises major protests in London or representative groups of the Palestinian community in the UK \"before making this far reaching statement on our rights\".\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Mr Jamal added.In support of the statement, the Board of Deputies of British Jews said: \"We strongly welcome this necessary intervention.\" \"We have long warned that people chanting slogans like 'globalise the intifada' are inciting violence, and we have been making the case for robust enforcement in relation to this slogan with government at all levels for some time,\" the board said.Gideon Falter, chief executive of Campaign Against Antisemitism, said police chiefs \"are only now waking up\" after \"two years of repeatedly excusing calls to 'globalise the intifada'\".In a statement, he said that \"banning this one chant is a useless token measure\", and added \"it is hard to see how they will possibly enforce this ban\".The Jewish Voice for Liberation - which describes itself as standing for the rights of Jews and Palestinians - said it does not believe the response is appropriate.The group said it had \"very rarely, if ever\" encountered any antisemitism it needed to respond to at demonstrations and said its community has \"always been welcomed\", adding that \"protests in London and elsewhere have not attacked synagogues or Jewish schools\".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced in parliament on Wednesday that his government has increased funding for Jewish security up to £28m.\"I'm pleased to do that, but I'm sad to do that,\" he said, adding that he has ordered a review of protest and hate crime laws.He was responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said antisemitism was real, \"poisonous\" and that \"we must all work together to stamp it out\".The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people.Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.",

    "body": "The Academy Awards will begin streaming exclusively on YouTube in 2029, the latest big change in Hollywood. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that it signed a multi-year deal that will give YouTube the exclusive global rights to the Oscars until 2033. The Oscars, which is planned for 15 March, has aired for a half a century on ABC. Starting in 2029, the show will be available live and for free on YouTube. It's another big shakeup in Hollywood, which is dealing with studio sales and mergers, along with steep production cuts.\"The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible - which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community,\" Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor said in a statement. Over decades, viewership of the awards show has declined, though there was a slight uptick in 2025, with a significant number of younger viewers tuning in from cell phones and computers. In a statement, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan called the Oscars \"one of our essential cultural institutions\" and said that partnering with the Academy would \"inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy\". ABC, which has streamed the awards since 1976, said that it was looking forward \"to the next three telecasts\" it will still host.The move comes as Warner Bros Discovery on Wednesday recommended its shareholders reject a hostile takeover bid from Paramount Skydance for a rival bid from streaming giant Netflix. Both options were seen as unfavourable for an industry that has seen drastic cuts over the past several years. Like major studios, cable networks have faced issues as the public has opted for streaming services instead. YouTube winning rights to the Academy Awards further suggests that reliance on streaming sites will continue.",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterLabour has granted six areas in and around London the power to make larger council tax hikes after reducing their share of government funding.Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, City of London, and Windsor and Maidenhead will be allowed to raise rates by more than 5% for two years without local voters needing to sign off the move.The authorities are among those expected to lose out under a move to shift more government cash towards deprived areas from next year. Ministers say the shake-up will make England's funding model fairer - but the Conservatives have accused them of wanting to \"punish\" low-tax councils.The new system, to be phased in over three years from 2026, aims to shift a greater share of government funding towards councils in England with higher deprivation and a higher share of properties in lower council tax bands.Labour argues these areas were harder hit when government grants were slashed during the austerity era in the 2010s, and that current funding rules, last updated in 2013, fail to reflect high demand among their residents for council services.A tweak to the new rules last month was believed to lessen the blow to inner London councils compared with the original proposals, unveiled in June, including by factoring in housing costs when deprivation is calculated.But the Institute of Fiscal Studies said the six councils granted additional council tax-raising powers were still among those areas facing the largest falls in their share of government funding.The think tank added that more urban and more deprived areas were set to see much bigger increases overall. It has previously said that outer London boroughs would fare better under the proposals. The six areas granted additional flexibility over council tax will be able to raise rates by more than 5% in 2026 and 2027 without the usual legal requirement to have it signed off in a local referendum.The local government department said the areas had been identified because of their \"very low\" council tax rates, with households in Band D paying between £450 and £1,280 less than the average in England.No council has ever won a referendum to raise council tax beyond 5% – although councils in precarious financial positions have been granted special permission to do so by the government, increasingly so in recent years.Residents in Birmingham have seen tax increases of more than 17% to balance the books over the last two years, after facing effective bankruptcy, while Croydon in south London raised its rates by 15% in 2023.The Conservatives said the funding review would \"punish councils that keep council tax low\" whilst \"moving funding to badly-run Labour councils that spend irresponsibly\".\"Inevitably, councils that lose out will be forced to cut services or raise tax - and with referendum principles scrapped, those hikes will be big,\" added shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly.Reform UK said the settlement would leave rural areas behind, \"funnelling money towards Labour-dominated London and city councils\".It comes as the government confirmed the overall level of council funding will go up by £3.9bn next year, 5.8%, assuming that all councils put up council tax by the maximum 5% across the board.

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterFifa will finally release its much-anticipated return to video games in 2026, several years after its acrimonious split with developer EA.But it is Netflix, rather than a major game studio, which has secured the rights to the upcoming football game.Once one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, issues including a costly licence prompted Fifa's previous publisher Electronic Arts to stop using the name in 2023 - instead naming its best-selling game EA Sports FC.Netflix said the new Fifa would be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - which has yet to release a video game - and released ahead of the 2026 World Cup.It said subscribers will be able to play online via the Netflix app on iOS and Android devices - or on select TVs by using their phone as the controller.EA Sports released the first Fifa game in 1993, and ran the franchise for 30 years until moving away from the branding to create its own.The series was estimated to have around 150 million players.But the renamed game still connected with fans - with EA FC 24 being the best-selling game in the UK in 2023.Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football governing body was \"very excited\" to team up with Netflix Games ahead of the World Cup in 2026.\"Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football,\" he said. \"It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for Fifa.\"California-based Delphi Interactive, the studio behind the game, is also working in partnership with IO Interactive on a new James Bond title, 007: First Light.The firm's boss Casper Daugaard said as \"lifelong Fifa fans\" it wanted to make the game \"the most fun, approachable, and global football game ever created\".Reaction to the announcement has so far been mixed, with some fans questioning whether the mobile-first focus from Netflix was the way forward for the franchise.\"FIFA should never have left EA,\" said one person on social media site X. \"Let's see what the new game's got.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoNardine SaadandRegan Morris,Los AngelesNick Reiner's lawyer says the case involves \"complex and serious issues\"Nick Reiner, the son of celebrated Hollywood director Rob Reiner, has appeared in court for the first time charged with murdering his parents.The 32-year-old waived his right to enter a plea to two charges of first-degree murder at the hearing, as all sides agreed to delay his arraignment until 7 January when he will once again have the opportunity to enter a plea.His lawyer, Alan Jackson, told reporters outside court that there were \"complex and serious issues\" in the case that needed to be worked through in the coming weeks.Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner were found stabbed to death in their Brentwood home on Sunday. Nick Reiner was charged with their murder on Tuesday.As he appeared in court in downtown Los Angeles, Mr Reiner only said \"yes, your honour\" when asked by Judge Theresa McGonigle if he understood that he has the right to a speedy trial.The judge earlier ordered the assembled media - who gathered outside the courthouse hours prior to the hearing - not to film the defendant, who wore what appeared to be a suicide prevention vest.Media inside the courtroom could not see Mr Reiner throughout the brief hearing because he was sitting in a corner out of sight.He was initially slated to make a court appearance on Tuesday but had not been medically cleared to do so, his lawyer and prosecutors said.\"We ask that during this process, you allow the system to move forward in the way that it was designed to move forward,\" Mr Reiner's lawyer, Alan Jackson, told reporters.\"Not with a rush to judgement, not with jumping to conclusions, but with restraint and with dignity, and with the respect that this system and this process deserves, and that the family deserves,\" he said.The delay in Mr Reiner entering a plea could be designed to allow time for a psychiatric evaluation, one criminal defence lawyer told the BBC after the hearing.\"The psychiatric evaluation is generally done before arraignment to see if he is even fit to stand trial,\" Seth Zuckerman said.Getty ImagesNick Reiner (right) is accused of killing his parentsUntil the next hearing on 7 January, Mr Reiner will remain in custody at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.If he pleads not guilty, he could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have said no decision has been made yet about whether the death penalty will be pursued.Rob Reiner directed a handful of iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.\"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city,\" LA Police Department chief Jim McDonnell said on Tuesday.With additional reporting from Sakshi Venkatraman",

    "body": "1 hour agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentTwo remand prisoners waiting to go on trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action have ended a hunger strike protest - but five more are said to be continuing to refuse food.The detainees, in various prisons, have made a series of demands including calling for the ban on Palestine Action to be lifted and for a defence firm with links to Israel to be shut down.The two longest-protesting detainees have been refusing food for 45 days according to supporters - a claim that has not been disputed by officials.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Sir Keir Starmer said \"rules and procedures\" were being followed in relation to the hunger strike.Lawyers for the group have repeatedly written to Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy asking for a meeting, saying there was a \"real and increasingly likely potential\" that their clients would die as a result of their protest.Fifty-one MPs and peers have also written to Lammy asking him to meet the lawyers.The protests, which began in November, involve people who have all been charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage on behalf of Palestine Action, charges that are denied. The alleged incidents all occurred before Palestine Action was banned under terrorism legislation - but their trials are not taking place before next year.Supporters of the detainees confirmed to BBC News on Wednesday that Jon Cink and Umer Khalid had both ended their hunger strike after 41 days and 13 days respectively.Qesser Zuhrah and Amy Gardiner-Gibson are said to have each been refusing food for 45 days. Heba Muraisi began her protest a day later. Teuta Hoxha is said to have refused for 38 days and Kamran Ahmed 37 days. An eighth prisoner is described by supporters of intermittently joining the protest but then breaking it, due to an underlying health condition.Some of the group have had periods in hospital - but in each case they have been discharged or have self-discharged. On Wednesday, an ambulance arrived at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey - and video posted on social media shows scuffles between protesters and police.The vehicle later left - but a spokesman for the South East Coast Ambulance Service would not comment on whether it had transported a protester to hospital.During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said to Sir Keir that ministers had declined to meet the protesters' representatives and one of the group had been taken to hospital.\"Many people are very concerned by the regular breaches of prison conditions and prison rules with respect to these hunger strikes,\" he said.\"Will he make arrangements for the Ministry of Justice to meet representatives of the hunger strikers to discuss these breaches of the conditions that they're experiencing at the present time?\"Sir Keir replied: \"He will appreciate there are rules and procedures in place in relation to hunger strikes, and we're following those rules and procedures.\"On Tuesday, justice minister Jake Richards said in answer to an earlier question from Corbyn that he would not be meeting the group's lawyers and the Ministry of Justice had \"robust and proper guidance and procedures\" for such scenarios.\"I am satisfied, and the ministry is satisfied, that those procedures are being enacted and we'll continue to keep it under review.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoAlex Partridge,Politics reporter,Emer Moreau,Business reporterandDamian Grammaticas,Political correspondentThe prime minister has said Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich must \"pay up now\" to victims of the war in Ukraine or face court action.Mr Abramovich, the former owner of Chelsea Football Club, pledged in 2022 that the £2.5bn he made from the sale of the club would be used to benefit victims of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.But there has been a delay in releasing the funds, which are currently frozen in a British bank account, due to a standoff over how exactly they should be used.Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons on Wednesday: \"My message to Abramovich is clear: the clock is ticking.\" The government wants the money to be used for humanitarian aid, but Mr Abramovich insisted it should be used for \"all victims of the war\" – meaning that Russians could also benefit.The oligarch cannot access the money under UK sanctions but the proceeds from the Chelsea sale still legally belong to him.Updating MPs, Sir Keir said the UK had issued a licence \"to transfer £2.5bn from the sale of Chelsea Football Club that's been frozen since 2022.\"And, in a warning to Abramovich, he said: \"Honour the commitment that you made and pay up now, and if you don't we're prepared to go to court and ensure that every penny reaches those whose lives have been torn apart by Putin's illegal war.\"And Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC Mr Abramovich \"needs to honour that commitment, pay that money\".Asked if a legal battle could drag out the process for years, Ms Cooper said: \"I'm urging him not to try and pursue further court action.\"But she confirmed the government will take the matter to court if he does not act.Mr Abramovich's representatives declined to comment.The Treasury said that under the terms of the licence, the money must go to \"humanitarian causes\" in Ukraine and cannot benefit Mr Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual.The government first threatened to sue Mr Abramovich in June.Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"It is unacceptable that more than £2.5bn of money owed to the Ukrainian people can be allowed to remain frozen in a UK bank account.\"Mr Abramovich – a Russian billionaire who made his fortune in oil and gas – was granted a special licence to sell Chelsea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, providing he could prove he would not benefit from the sale.He is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, something he has denied.It is understood that Mr Abramovich has 90 days to act before the UK considers taking legal action.On Thursday, EU leaders are set to review proposals to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's huge budget and defence needs. Russia has fiercely opposed the proposals.",

    "body": "14 hours agoVishnukant TiwariMadhya PradeshOn a recent winter morning in Panna, a diamond mining region in central India, two childhood friends made a discovery that they think could change their lives forever.Satish Khatik and Sajid Mohammed stumbled upon a large, glistening rock on a plot of land they had leased just weeks earlier.When they took the stone to the city's official diamond evaluator, they learnt they had found a 15.34-carat gem-quality diamond - one of the finest varieties of natural diamonds that exist.\"The estimated market price of the stone is around five to six million rupees [$55,000 - $66,000; £41,000 - £49,000] and it will be auctioned soon,\" Anupam Singh, the diamond evaluator, told BBC Hindi. The government holds quarterly auctions, drawing buyers from across India and abroad to bid for the diamonds.\"Estimated prices depend on the dollar rate and benchmarks set by the Rapaport report,\" Mr Singh said. Rapaport is widely regarded as a leading authority on independent diamond and jewellery market analysis.Mr Khatik and Mr Mohammed say they are over the moon. \"We can now get our sisters married,\" they said.Mr Khatik, 24, who runs a meat shop and Mr Mohammed, 23 who sells fruits, come from poor backgrounds and are the youngest sons in their families. For generations, their families have been trying their luck at finding diamonds, which is a common quest among the district's residents.Panna, which is in Madhya Pradesh state, is among India's least developed districts - its residents face poverty, water scarcity and unemployment. But it's also home to most of India's diamond reserves and remains a prime destination for diamond hunters.India's diamond reserves are relatively limited compared with the world's major producers, but they are historically significant.While most mines are run by the federal government, state authorities lease small plots to locals each year at nominal rates. With few job opportunities in the city, residents hope for a prized find to improve their fortunes - but most come up empty-handed.Mr Mohammed says that his father and grandfather had dug through these plots for decades but discovered nothing more that \"dust and slivers of quartz\".His father Nafees says that the \"gods have finally rewarded their hard work and patience\".They leased a plot in search of diamonds partly out of desperation, as their meagre incomes could not keep pace with rising household costs - let alone pay for a wedding, Mr Mohammed told the BBC.Searching for diamonds is no easy task but the two friends would sift through mounds of dirt after work in the evenings, or whenever they got time off from their day jobs.Like most locals, they searched for diamonds by hand - digging pits, hauling out soil and rock, washing it through sieves and carefully sifting through thousands of tiny stones once dried.Ravi Patel, Panna's district mining officer, said the two friends were incredibly lucky. \"They had leased out a plot on 19 November. It's their luck that they found a diamond of gem quality within a few weeks,\" he said.Though they have yet to collect the money, Mr Khatik and Mr Mohammed say they are hopeful.\"We are not thinking of buying land, expanding our businesses or moving to a bigger city; not yet. For now, we are focused on getting our sisters married,\" they said.",

    "body": "Researchers tracking wild polar bears in northern Canada have witnessed something exceedingly rare: a mother bear adopting a cub that was not biologically her own. The five-year-old mother bear and her 10- to 11-month-old cubs were observed and captured on camera during the annual polar bear migration along the Western Hudson Bay near Churchill, Manitoba, a town known for its polar bear population.\"It's unusual,\" Alyssa McCall, a scientist at Polar Bears International, said in a video. \"We don't really know why it happens... but we know it doesn't happen often at all.\"It's only the 13th known case of adoption out of the 4,600 bears studied for nearly five decades in the area. The mother bear was first captured as she emerged from her maternity den this spring. At the time, she had one cub, which scientists tagged for study.In the fall, she was seen again, but this time with two cubs - the original cub that had been tagged and another without a tag. Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. \"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. \"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said.

    "body": "2 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has rejected calls to stop a trial of puberty blocking drugs for gender-questioning children.Streeting permanently banned the prescribing of puberty blockers to under-18s last year.He told MPs he was \"uncomfortable\" about such drugs being used on young people but said he had given the go-ahead to a clinical trial as recommended by the Cass Review into children's gender care, because it was the \"right thing to do\".Conservative shadow health minister Dr Caroline Johnson, a consultant paediatrician who said she had looked after children with gender dysphoria, asked why the government was funding experiments on \"physically healthy children\" when Streeting himself had said he was \"uncomfortable\" about the use of these drugs. Streeting replied: \"The reason why, whatever my discomfort in this extremely sensitive area, I have made this decision is because I am following clinical advice and because, as health secretary, it is my responsibility to follow expert advice.\"He added: \"Am I uncomfortable about puberty-suppressing hormones for this group of young people, for these particular conditions? Yes, I am, because of risks.\"But he said he had also been \"uncomfortable\" when he introduced a permanent ban \"because I had to look children and young people in the eye, and their parents, who told me in no uncertain terms that that decision was harmful to them\".Puberty blockers are drugs used to delay or prevent puberty happening.The drugs are not prescribed on the NHS to children for the treatment of gender dysphoria outside clinical trials, with the agreement of devolved governments across the UK.But a trial was recommended by the Cass Review, which concluded that the quality of research claiming to show the benefits of puberty blockers for youngsters with gender dysphoria was \"poor\".The PATHWAYS trial, which is due to start in January,  will involve children who are being seen at gender clinics in England. The research team says their physical and mental health will be closely monitored and there will be a careful consent process involving both children and their parents. Researchers say they will also monitor bone density and brain development.Objections to the trial include concerns about the potential impact on brain development, fertility and bone density, and the ability of young children to consent.Streeting told MPs he had backed the trial because it had been recommended by Dr Cass in her review, which had been commissioned by his Conservative predecessor Sir Sajid Javid.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has joined those calling for the trial, which will involve around 226 people aged between 10 and almost 16, to be stopped to prevent harm to children.Dr Johnson, who branded it \"Streeting's trial\", told MPs: \"The vast majority of the children in this trial are being unnecessarily experimented on with risky medications under his leadership.\"Labour MP Preet Kaur Gill, a former children's services manager, urged Streeting to meet clinicians and academics amid fears \"credible safeguarding warnings... are not actually being heard\".Streeting said he was \"absolutely open to receiving representations and evidence from clinicians involved in the care of children and young people\", including his critics.Some Labour MPs said that it was important young trans people's health needs were met. Labour MP Danny Beales said: \"We know that young people are seeking out provision. They are seeking out unregulated providers of these drugs. Therefore a clinical trial is appropriate and the best and safest way of managing any potential risks.\"Streeting later told MPs: \"The parents of trans young people love their children very much, and that has been at the heart of so many of the representations that I have received from parents as well as young people.\"Earlier on Wednesday, Streeting told the health and social care select committee the decision to go ahead with the trial was \"one that I wrestle with on a daily basis\".He stressed that no child will be able to take part in the clinical trial without parental consent.",

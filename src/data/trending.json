Republicans say it’s needed because the previous committee, led by Democrat Nancy Pelosi was a “sham from the start”, finding Trump responsible for inciting the riots.  \nBut Democrats continue to blame Donald Trump, accusing the US president of pardoning hundreds of violent rioters and trying to reversion the history of Jan 6th.  \nIn today’s episode, Marianna and Anthony discuss why the divisions continue, what the American public think, and who is winning the argument of what really happened that day.  \nHOSTS: \n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by George Dabby and Grace Reeve.

Her mother, Sarah Keeling, 45, and passer-by Mark Ratcliffe, 67, both died after trying to save her.While formal identification is yet to take place, police said they believed this person to be Grace. The discovery was made on Thursday but her body was unable to be recovered due to tide times and conditions.Det Supt Simon Vickers said: \"This was a deeply upsetting incident, and I cannot begin to understand the heartbreak felt by all the loved ones of those involved.\"Vickers said they had spoken to Grace's family and updated them, and were continuing to support them with specially trained officers.\"Understandably, they have asked for their privacy, and we would ask that this is respected,\" he said.Police said her body was discovered at about 08:30 GMT on Thursday on the rocks at Withernsea beach, following extensive searches over the past 14 days. They added that \"despite every effort it was not possible to safely recover Grace before high tide yesterday\".Officers said they were able to recover her body on Saturday morning with the help of HM Coastguard and Humberside Fire and Rescue Service.Jasmine Lowe / BBCOne of many heartfelt tributes placed at the scene in WithernseaHumberside Police thanked everyone who had offered or assisted in the search.Vickers added: \"Our thoughts and sincere sympathies will always remain with the families of Grace and Sarah Keeling, and Mark Ratcliffe following this utter tragedy.\"Police had previously said that, from trawling through CCTV and speaking to multiple witnesses, it was understood that Grace and a friend were on the steps near to the rocks when she was \"believed to have fallen into the water after being swept by a wave\".A major operation was launched at 15:10 GMT following reports of people in the water. It involved HM Coastguard, emergency services, the RNLI and included helicopters and lifeboats.Ratcliffe, from Withernsea, was pulled unconscious from the sea and died at the scene.

    "body": "Fourteen people have been arrested and four people taken to hospital after a protest outside the Iranian embassy in London.One protester climbed across balconies to reach the embassy's terraces and remove a flag before being detained on Friday night, police said.A further 13 were arrested for offences including violent disorder, assault of an emergency worker, criminal damage and trespass on diplomatic premises.Demonstrations have been taking place outside the embassy amid widespread anti-government protests in Iran, where thousands have been killed in the unrest.The Metropolitan Police said objects had been thrown at police during the protest and that four officers had sustained minor injuries, though none were believed to have been taken to hospital. The man who removed the flag was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, trespass on diplomatic property and assaulting police, the Met said. He remains in custody. The force added that a group of protesters had attempted to prevent his lawful arrest and dispersal tactics were used by officers \"to ensure the safety of those concerned and prevent further disorder\".A section 35 dispersal order was imposed outside the embassy \"as a result of ongoing disorder\", it added.A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said it was called to reports of an incident at the junction of Exhibition Road and Kensington Road - near where the Iranian embassy and a number of other embassies are located - at around 20:45 GMT on Friday.Four people were taken to hospital while two others were treated at the scene, they added.Earlier this week, the Iranian ambassador in London was summoned to the Foreign Office after a number of protesters in Iran were killed. Last Saturday, two people were arrested at a protest outside the embassy in which a demonstrator also climbed onto the building's balcony and appeared to tear down the Iranian flag. ",

    "body": "7 hours agoNick Eardley,political correspondent,andOttilie MitchellConservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has insisted Britain is not broken after her former shadow minister Robert Jenrick criticised the party for failing to campaign on that line.She wrote in the Daily Telegraph: \"Ours is still one of the most successful, resilient and influential countries on Earth,\" adding that telling voters their \"country is finished\" only \"drags them down\".She also insisted that the Conservatives were stronger after she sacked Jenrick hours before he defected to Reform.Jenrick told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in an interview on Friday that a shadow cabinet meeting in which colleagues had failed to agree that the country was broken had been the final straw for him.In her editorial, Badenoch said there were problems in the UK, some of which were getting worse, but that the country's best days laid ahead.She insisted the Conservatives were best placed to offer solutions to the country's problems, saying that Reform were destined to fail as they welcomed \"toxic people\" who \"destroy organisations\".\"A movement built on grievance and serial disloyalty is doomed to fail, and they will be at each other's throats soon enough,\" the opposition leader wrote.In a separate editorial in the Daily Express, Badenoch said \"some things in Britain are broken, but they are not broken beyond repair\".She also criticised politicians who \"talk Britain down instead of showing they have a plan to build it back up\". Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice praised Jenrick as \"the only cabinet minister who resigned on a matter of principle from the Conservative government\" in an interview with BBC Newsnight on Friday.He was referencing Jenrick's decision to resign from Rishi Sunak's government over his view that it was not going far enough to find a solution to fast-rising immigration levels.Tice continued: \"That makes him uniquely qualified to actually to explain where things went so badly wrong on both legal and illegal immigration, which is to the fury of tens of millions of British people.\"He told BBC Breakfast on Saturday that Jenrick had \"tremendous experience, and we've been criticised for not having the experience to be able to govern and manage things - and now we bring in someone with that experience and we're still being criticised\".Badenoch said that Jenrick's defection \"was never about principle, it was about ambition\" and \"every criticism he now makes occurred when he was in government\".The Tories are now a \"stronger and more united team\", she wrote. Badenoch hopes her sacking Jenrick will strengthen her position as Tory leader and make her look decisive.But Reform now has a new, prominent MP who is intent on publicising what he sees are the many mistakes of his former party.",

    "body": "The Syrian army is moving into areas east of Aleppo city, after Kurdish forces started a withdrawal.Syrian troops have been spotted entering Deir Hafer, a town about 50km (30 miles) from Aleppo.On Friday, the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia announced it would redeploy east of the Euphrates river. This follows talks with US officials, and a pledge from Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa to make Kurdish a national language.After deadly clashes last week, the US urged both sides to avoid a confrontation. President al-Sharaa is seeking to integrate the Kurds' military and civilian bodies into Syrian national institutions.In a statement to state-run news agency Sana, the Syrian army said its forces \"began entering the western Euphrates area\", and declared it had established \"full military control\" of Deir Hafer.The military urged civilians not to enter the operations area until it is secured and \"cleared it of all mines and war remnants\".Images showed Syrian forces advancing towards the area, including with tanks.The move comes after Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi agreed to pull back his US-backed SDF \"towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates\", responding to \"calls from friendly countries and mediators\".US special envoy Tom Barrack and Mazloum Abdi are set to meet later on Saturday in Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.In recent days, the Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.Before the Kurdish withdrawal, President al-Sharaa said he would make Kurdish a national language, and recognise the Kurdish new year as an official holiday.The decree, announced on Friday, is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria's independence in 1946. It stated that Kurds were \"an essential and integral part\" of Syria, where they have endured decades of oppression under previous rulers.Despite the apparent easing of tensions, disagreements linger. In response to the decree, the Kurdish administration in Syria's north and north-east said it was \"a first step\" but called for \"permanent constitutions that express the will of the people\", rather than \"temporary decrees\".Both sides have accused each other of violating the terms of the agreement. Syria's army said two of its soldiers had been killed by Kurdish forces as the military moved in, while the SDF accused Damascus of sending troops in early. Kurdish forces have been controlling swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and north-east, much of it gained during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.Following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, President al-Sharaa has been seeking to integrate the Kurdish bodies into Syrian institutions.In March 2025, the SDF signed a deal with the government to that effect. Almost a year on, the agreement is still not implemented, with each sides blaming the other.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", during recent protests.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed and blamed the US for the deaths.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoAmy WalkerAndrea BradyJessica Brady contacted her GP practice more than 20 times feeling unwellA new system urging doctors to \"think again\" if they are unable to pin down a diagnosis after seeing a patient three times - named Jess's Rule - is to be advertised in every GP surgery in England from next week. The NHS initiative is named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced stage four cancer in 2020 aged 27.Before her eventual diagnosis, Jess had contacted her GP on more than 20 occasions after feeling unwell, but was told her symptoms were related to long Covid and that she was \"too young for cancer\".Her mother, Andrea Brady, welcomed the government rollout of the posters. She told BBC Breakfast: \"We still need to trust our doctors but trust ourselves as well.\"Under the patient safety initiative, GPs are asked to take a \"fresh eyes\" approach if they have been unable to offer a patient a substantiated diagnosis or their symptoms have escalated after three appointments.Jess, an engineer at Airbus, became ill in June 2020. Andrea said her family initially assumed it was something minor, \"but that wasn't what happened for Jess\".Her symptoms, which included unexplained weight loss, night sweats and vomiting, then worsened. \"It was very, very painful... to see the impact on Jess not just physically but the toll it was taking on her mentally,\" said Andrea.Jess had contact with six different doctors at her GP surgery and three face-to-face consultations with a family doctor, but no referral to a specialist was made.Her family then arranged a private appointment and she was referred to a specialist,   who gave Jess a terminal cancer diagnosis of adenocarcinoma - cancer of the glands that line the organs - in November.She died three weeks later, just days before Christmas 2020.Andrea said her daughter was \"trying to be really resilient and advocate for herself\" before her diagnosisThe government said the consultation room posters would improve patient safety by prompting doctors to \"revisit patient records, challenge initial assumptions and remain alert to warning signs that might otherwise be missed\".Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"Every patient deserves to be heard, and every serious illness deserves to be caught early. \"Jess's Rule makes that possible - reminding clinicians to take a fresh look when symptoms persist, and empowering patients to speak up about their care.\"Andrea said the family wanted to follow what Jess had \"really wanted to start when she was diagnosed, which was to create some positive change\".\"It's taken five years but to know now that Jess's rule is out there and happening and is being received really positively and proactively by primary care colleagues is really, really important,\" she added.She said the rule was a \"two-way thing\" intended to benefit both patients and GPs.The posters were designed by Jess's parents Andrea and Simon in partnership with NHS England and the Department of Health, and funded by the Jessica Brady Cedar Trust established in her honour.Dr Claire Fuller, NHS England's national medical director, said: \"Encouraging GP teams to challenge a diagnosis when it matters most could save lives by avoiding missed or late diagnoses.\"",

    "body": "Ugandan leader extends 40-year rule after winning contested poll2 hours agoAnita Nkonge,BBC Africa,Lucy FlemingandJoseph WinterAFP via Getty ImagesYoweri Museveni first came to power in 1986 as a rebel leaderUgandan President Yoweri Museveni has been declared the winner of Thursday's election extending his four decades in power by another five years.He gained 72% of the vote, the election commission announced, against 25% for his closest challenger Bobi Wine, who has condemned what he described as \"fake results\" and \"ballot stuffing\".Wine has not provided any details and the authorities have not responded to his allegations, but African Union election observers said they saw \"no evidence of ballot stuffing\". Wine has called for non-violent protests.Museveni, 81, first came to power as a rebel leader in 1986 but since then has won seven elections. The election process was marred by violence and Wine, a 43-year-old former pop star, says that at least 21 people have been killed around the country in recent days.The authorities have so far confirmed seven deaths.Access to the internet has been cut in the country since Tuesday, making it hard to verify information.The authorities say the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".Wine has demanded that the internet be restored.ReutersSpeaker of Parliament Anita Among celebrated Yoweri Museveni's victory at the electoral commissionLeading the African Union observer mission, Nigeria's former President Goodluck Jonathan told journalists that \"the government should refrain from the suspension of internet access\" close to the election.Jonathan also denounced \"reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions\" saying they \"instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process\", AFP news agency reports.Overnight, Wine's party said that he had been abducted from his home in the capital, Kampala - a claim denied by the police.Wine later issued a statement on Facebook saying that he had managed to evade a night-time raid by security forces and was in hiding.He had previously said he was under house arrest.This has not been confirmed by the police but spokesman Kituuma Rusoke said  Wine's movements had been restricted because his home was an area of \"security interest\".\"We have controlled access to areas which are security hotspots,\" Uganda's Daily Monitor paper quoted him as saying.\"We cannot allow people to use some places to gather and cause chaos,\" he said.Wine says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30. During the campaign, he promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argued that he was the sole guarantor of stability in Uganda, a country with a history of conflict.There were six other candidates but none got more than 2% of the vote. Turnout was 52.5%.The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters.Rusoke, the police spokesperson, dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.More about Uganda from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Grieving mum suing TikTok says hearing was 'painful'7 hours agoSarah TurnnidgeWest of England BBCEllen Roome is one of five British parents suing TikTok over their children's deathsA British mother suing TikTok after the death of her son has described the first hearing in the United States as \"deeply painful\". Ellen Roome, 49, from Gloucestershire, has been campaigning since her 14-year-old son Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney died at home in Cheltenham in 2022.She travelled to Delaware with a group of parents this week as part of a lawsuit which claims their children all died while attempting a \"blackout challenge\". A TikTok spokesperson said: \"We strictly prohibit content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour.\"In a statement posted to social media on Friday, Roome said: \"We now have to wait for the judge to decide whether the case is dismissed or whether we are allowed to proceed to the discovery stage.\"For the court, this is about motions and procedures. For us, it is about our children. Our dead children.\"The case, filed by the Social Media Victims Law Centre in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware, alleges Jools, Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Noah Gibson, 11 and Maia Walsh, 13, died while attempting an online challenge.It claims the children's deaths were \"the foreseeable result of ByteDance's engineered addiction-by-design and programming decisions\", which were \"aimed at pushing children into maximising their engagement with TikTok by any means necessary\".PAJools died at home in Cheltenham in 2022, aged just 14 Roome sold the financial business she had run for 18 years to campaign for Jools' Law, a right for parents to access their deceased child's data without a court order.She is also pushing for wider changes to social media to improve the safety of children online.Following Jools' death, a coroner returned a narrative verdict at his inquest and ruled out suicide. Roome believes her son died after an online challenge went wrong.Since her son's death, Roome has been trying to obtain data from TikTok and ByteDance which she believes could provide an explanation as to what happened.In her online update, Roome added: \"Listening to law argue abstract points while the reality of our loss sat silently behind every word was deeply painful. This is our lived experience, our grief and our determination to find the truth and protect other children.\"Whatever the outcome, we showed up. We spoke for our children. And we will keep going.\"'Deepest sympathies' TikTok has applied to dismiss the case, stating UK residents are suing US entities which do not operate the social media firm's services in the UK and established US law bars liability for third-party content on the platform.A spokesperson for TikTok said their \"deepest sympathies\" remain with the families and \"content that promotes or encourages dangerous behaviour\" is strictly prohibited on the platform. \"As a company, we comply with the UK's strict data protection laws,\" they added. It is understood the online challenge which the parents say is responsible for their children's deaths has been blocked on TikTok since 2020.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan CorrespondentandDearbail Jordan,Reporter Watch: Firefighters battle deadly blaze at Karachi shopping centreA fire at a shopping centre in the Pakistan city of Karachi has killed six people as firefighters continue to battle the blaze.Parts of the Gul Plaza, containing 1,200 stores and spanning 8,000 sq m (86,111 sq ft), have collapsed which officers said was hampering rescue efforts.One firefighter is among the dead, more than 20 people have been injured and there are fears some are still trapped inside the multi-storey mall.Local emergency services said that when helpers arrived at the site on Saturday \"the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames\".A senior police official told the BBC that the authorities had been unable to search the building for bodies as the fire has continued to burn. More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

Naked, the production company behind the award-winning show, said social media checks had \"failed to flag the offensive posts\", and that the process would be reviewed.Hodgetts-Hague has apologised for the posts, which have subsequently been deleted.The messages from Hodgetts-Hague are said to have included attacks on Islam and used derogatory language to refer to women.In other published posts from 2013 he reportedly expressed support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.BBC News has not seen the posts following the closure of the candidate's social media account.A BBC spokesperson said the views presented in the posts were \"totally unacceptable\" and the organisation was taking this \"extremely seriously\".\"We were completely unaware that this contestant had made such abhorrent comments,\" they said.\"We have asked the independent production company to fully review the social media checks undertaken given the process has clearly failed in this instance.\"The show presented by Lord Sugar is set to launch its 20th series on 29 January in which 20 candidates will compete for the chance to win £250,000 and go into business with the tycoon.Filming concluded in 2025, meaning Hodgetts-Hague will still appear in the programme.In a statement issued to The Sun on Sunday, Hodgetts-Hague said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed\" by the posts he made more than a decade ago.\"I offer my sincere apologies to all who I've offended, as well as my fellow candidates, for the truly awful language and views that they contain,\" he said.\"I take full accountability for the publishing of those posts. They are not a reflection of the values I uphold today.\"I would like to apologise for my actions, as well as to the production team for failing to bring this account to their attention.\"Production company Naked said it worked with \"reputable third-party providers\" to carry out comprehensive background and social media checks on all candidates.This is part of the company's \"rigorous due diligence\" before casting, a spokesperson said.\"On this occasion, these checks failed to flag the offensive posts, therefore we will be reviewing this process moving forward.\"\"Levi's historical posts contain language which is unacceptable and Levi has been spoken to about this behaviour,\" they added. \"He has apologised and insists that these posts do not reflect the man he is now.\"Earlier this week, a separate former Apprentice contestant, Dr Asif Munaf, was struck off the medical register after a tribunal found he posted antisemitic, racist and sexist posts on social media.Munaf, a candidate on series 18 in 2024, posted or reposted a total of 36 \"seriously offensive\" comments on X between October 2023 and July 2025.",

    "body": "Chilean President Gabriel Boric has declared a state of catastrophe in two regions where deadly wildfires are raging.At least 16 people are confirmed dead in the Ñuble and Biobío regions, about 500km (300 miles) south of the capital Santiago. At least 20,000 have been evacuated. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media show pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling a total of 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. \"All resources are available,\" he added.The fires have affected 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) in the two regions so far, local media say.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames amid summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the next two days.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, according to Syrian state media.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. The announcement followed a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "3 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after it revealed the US did not include Israel in talks to do with its creation.Netanyahu's office said it was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\", following Saturday's announcement of the committee's Gaza Executive Board, which includes the Turkish foreign minister and a Qatari official, as well as former-UK PM Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.The Board of Peace, which is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war, is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction. Its exact structure remains unclear and members are still being invited.Two separate senior bodies have been officially unveiled, both of which sit under the main Board of Peace.One is a \"founding Executive Board\", with a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy. The other, the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute billion dollars ($1bn; £745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news , a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes aid and fixed roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

    "body": "9 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterEPANigel Farage has insisted Reform UK will not become the Conservative Party 2.0 following the defection of former senior Tory Robert Jenrick.The party's leader wrote in the Telegraph that Reform was \"not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP\" and any potential defectors would have to be prepared to admit publicly that the previous Conservative government \"broke the country\".Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that Jenrick was \"a great new asset\" who brought ministerial experience.However, with around 20 former Conservative MPs joining the party in recent months, critics have argued Reform is becoming a home for failed Tories rather than a new force in British politics.Farage has said his party will not accept any more defectors after local elections are held on 7 May.\"Any Conservative MP who still clings to the hope that their party can recover and waits until May 8 to try to leave the sinking ship does not understand how rapidly things are changing out in the country,\" he wrote in the Telegraph.\"Trying to use Reform as a lifeboat to save their own political skins will not wash. We have no interest in rescuing political failures.\"He said any defectors would have to bring some benefits to the party and \"truly believe in Reform's fundamental values of family, community and country\".Senior Conservatives believe some other MPs could also defect, though they are not expecting a big wave of departures imminently.Reform has also said a \"well-known Labour figure\" will defect to the party next week.Former Labour MP and Brexit campaigner Baroness Kate Hoey, who has sat as a non-affiliated peer since 2020, is among those rumoured to be a possible defector.Asked if she could join Reform, Tice - who stood in for Farage due to illness - told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Baroness Hoey was \"a wonderful person\" and \"a good friend\" but refused to confirm whether she would defect.Baroness Hoey has not said whether she plans to defect or not, but told Sky News she had not been a Labour member for more than eight years and was \"not sure I'm that well-known\".Some commentators have suggested senior Tory defectors could prompt power struggles within Reform, with Jenrick touted as a possible shadow chancellor, along with Tice and Reform's head of policy Zia Yusuf.Asked if he would be happy to see Jenrick as shadow chancellor, Tice said the party had \"a great range of talent\" and Farage would \"make his decision about different roles at the appropriate time\".Robert Jenrick is 'a great new asset to Reform' says TiceJenrick joined Reform on Thursday, hours after he was sacked from the Conservative shadow cabinet for plotting to defect.As a former immigration, housing and health minister, Jenrick brings government experience to Reform.However, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"Bringing in Robert Jenrick, who presided over soaring NHS waiting lists and the collapse of the criminal justice system in this country, to solve the problems this country faces is like calling out the arsonists to put out the fire.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has claimed her party was stronger and more united since Jenrick left, saying he was not \"a team player\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoKathryn ArmstrongReutersMette Frederiksen and other European allies are standing in solidarity with Greenland, despite Trump's threat of tariffsDenmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen says \"Europe won't be blackmailed\", as she and other European leaders continue to weigh their response to US President Donald Trump's tariff threats over Greenland.Trump says he will impose new taxes on eight US allies - Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK - in February if they oppose his proposed takeover of the autonomous Danish territory.He insists Greenland is critical for US security and has not ruled out taking it by force - a move that has drawn widespread criticism. The countries threatened with tariffs have now issued joint statement, saying Trump's plan risks a \"dangerous downward spiral\".\"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations,\" they said, reiterating that they \"stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\".The countries stressed they are \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest\" as members of the Nato military alliance. \"We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement reads. Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: \"We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed.\"\"It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community.\"It came as EU members held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday. Why does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato?Faisal Islam: Trump's Greenland threats to allies are without parallelTrump has threatened to impose a 10% tariff on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland, which would come into force on 1 February, but could later rise to 25% - and would last until a deal was reached.\"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable,\" he wrote, adding: \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security and Survival of our Planet\".The US president insists Greenland is critical for US security and has said previously that Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\".Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press that \"Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US\".\"I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States,\" he said.It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its \"anti-coercion instrument\" if Trump does impose them. The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme \"how can we co-operate in a more contested world?\" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was \"concerned by the recent escalation\" and that it would be \"significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure\".\"Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato,\" he also wrote on X.The head of Nato, Mark Rutte, meanwhile, said he had spoken to Trump \"regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic\".\"We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,\" he added. EPA/ShutterstockProtests were held over the weekend in both Denmark and GreenlandPublic anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished. Demonstrations against Trump's takeover plans were held in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, on Saturday - before the tariff announcement - as well as in Danish cities. These rallies coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a delegation from the US Congress. Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".The island's representative to the US has said that the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against.A recent poll suggests that most Americans also oppose US control of Greenland. A Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was released last Wednesday, indicated just 17% of Americans support the US taking Greenland, compared to 47% who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBecky Morton,political reporter,andDaniel De Simone,investigations correspondent ReutersThe government has pulled an amendment to its Hillsborough Law following a backlash from campaigners and some Labour MPs.The draft legislation would introduce a legal obligation for public authorities to co-operate with and tell the truth to inquiries.But bereaved families raised concerns that MI5 and MI6 officers could be exempted from disclosing information, after the government put forward an amendment that would have made doing so subject to the approval of the head of their service. The government will no longer put this proposal to a vote on Monday, with a spokesperson saying it would continue to work with all parties to strengthen the bill \"without compromising national security\".The move was welcomed by the Hillsborough Law Now campaign group, which said it would \"engage further with government to ensure the bill fully applies to the security services whilst not jeopardising national security\".The proposed law - named after the football stadium in Sheffield where a deadly crush occurred in 1989 - aims to make the security services more accountable for failings. The government amendment sought to balance this with protecting confidential information.Ministers were facing a potential rebellion from Labour MPs, with around 30 backing a proposal by Liverpool Labour MP Ian Byrne that would ensure the legislation applied fully to security service personnel.The bill is due to complete its remaining stages in the House of Commons on Monday and the government now hopes to bring forward amendments when it reaches the House of Lords.Byrne - a long-standing campaigner for the law - told the BBC: \"I think there's been an acknowledgement that their amendment was heading for defeat, and thank God they've withdrawn it.\"However, he added: \"I won't vote for any law to leave the Commons until myself and the families are happy with what it contains...\"I have spoken to some families, and they are absolutely firm that it has to be the full Hillsborough Law before it leaves the Commons.\"It is understood that Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee did not support the government's proposed amendment, posing an additional problem for ministers.It is also understood that, amid increasing government concern about a rebellion, the head of MI5 Sir Ken McCallum was personally involved in speaking to some MPs.The draft law, formally known as the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, is designed to stop cover-ups and would place the same \"duty of candour\" on security service personnel as other public servants.However, campaigners had argued that giving those running security services approval over disclosures would allow them to choose what could be disclosed, and said they could not support the bill in its current form.Families bereaved by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack had also called for the law to apply fully to security services.A public inquiry found MI5 had not given an \"accurate picture\" of the key intelligence it held on the suicide bomber who carried out the attack, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.The Labour mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region, Andy Burnham and Steve Rotherham, had also criticised the government's amendment, saying it created \"too broad an opt-out and risks undermining the spirit of the legislation\".A government spokesperson said: \"This legislation will right the wrongs of the past, changing the balance of power to ensure the state can never hide from the people it should serve, and putting a legal duty on officials to respond openly and honestly when things go wrong.\"The bill will make the police, intelligence agencies and the whole of government more scrutinised than they have ever been, but we can never compromise on national security.\"Earlier, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that she was confident the government would be able to resolve disagreements over the bill before Monday's vote.She insisted security services would not be exempt from the legislation but said ministers faced the challenge of ensuring officers, who often held confidential information, could continue to do their jobs.Nandy added that the government wanted to make sure \"we never ever end up in a situation like we did with the Manchester Arena inquiry... where the security services are able to withhold information and present an inaccurate picture to families and to a public inquiry for a very long time\".The Hillsborough Law is the result of campaigning by families affected by the stadium crush, which led to the death of 97 football fans.Police leaders were found to have spread false narratives about the disaster, blaming Liverpool fans, and withheld evidence of their own failings.",

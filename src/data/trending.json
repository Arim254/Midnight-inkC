    "body": "12 hours agoRuth CleggSenior health reporter BBCBack in the 1990s, Alan Reeves would regularly perform on stage, stripping off to thousands as a member of The Dreamboys. He was so sought after that he, along with his troupe of male dancers, popped up in the Spice Girls film, Spice World.The then 24-year-old was, by his own admission, \"a bit of a pin up\".But by the time Reeves was in his 30s, he found himself in a very different situation — his mood was low and his libido had virtually disappeared.\"I just didn't feel right,\" he says.Reeves, now aged 52, says his lack of a sex drive began to have a detrimental impact on his long term relationship.\"We were going without sex for three, four months at a time. I just wasn't interested,\" he says.\"This kind of thing can cause couples to break up.\"Fragile Films/ Icon Entertainment International/ Polygram Filmed EntertainmentGeri Halliwell and Alan Reeves in the Spice Girls film, Spice WorldNow a fitness and lifestyle coach based in London, Reeves began testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and says it has given him his libido back, turning him \"from a grumpy old man\" to feeling like he's back in his 20s. It just \"felt phenomenal\" he says.And women too are turning to testosterone.Rachel Mason, a 37‑year‑old menopause blogger, says the hormone has been \"amazing\" for her energy levels, concentration, and libido.Prescriptions for testosterone have surged. The latest data from the NHS Business Authority, compiled by the Care Quality Commission, shows that prescribing rose by 135% between 2021 and 2024.This increase comes at a time when sex drive across the UK appears to be waning. According to the National Surveys of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal), which questions more than 10,000 people roughly each decade with new figures due out later this year, the frequency of sex has steadily declined.In 1990, people aged 16 to 44 reported having sex an average of five times a month. By 2000, that had dropped to four times, and by 2010, to three. The next set of results are due later this year, and researchers expect the downward trend to continue — though they do not point to a singular reason for the decline.Against this backdrop, a debate is gathering pace. Can boosting testosterone improve libido, or is much of the attention solely hype, profit, and placebo?Diminishing sex driveAlan Reeves' experience of declining libido is just one example of a trend researchers say is becoming increasingly common.\"Over the years, we have noticed a drop across every demographic,\" says Soazig Clifton, Natsal academic director.\"There are fewer cohabiting couples than there were in the 90s, for example, so that could help explain the reduction in sex drive, but even when we looked specifically at that group, there was a decrease.\"In fact, some of the steepest declines in sexual frequency were among older, married or cohabiting couples.Clifton says it is difficult to say conclusively why sex drive seems to be declining.\"No data we have so far can really tell us with any confidence why, as a population, we are no longer having sex as much,\" she says.There are several studies which try to understand the reason, highlighting that the digital world could be a major factor, making it harder to switch off, as well as offering more choices of things to do.Our stress levels are also generally higher than they were 30 years ago, which may be a factor, says Dr Ben Davis, a GP and sex therapist.\"People have so much going on,\" he explains, \"There's tech obviously, but there's also an increase in stress, depression, loneliness […] all of these will add to a reduction in sex drives.\"And there is another possibility that has generated lots of interest online and become big business —  that low testosterone levels could be having an impact on sex drive.\"Testosterone levels in men are definitely reducing,\" says Prof Geoffrey Hackett, consultant urologist and member of the British Society for Sexual Medicine (BSSM).\"The rise in obesity, type 2 diabetes, the increasing number of people leading more sedentary lives — all of these reduce testosterone levels. And declining testosterone levels will be a factor in why our sex drive is diminishing.\"Several large scale studies over the past 20 years which have measured levels in men, suggest that testosterone levels have dropped, but Hackett stresses that the picture is nuanced — having low testosterone does increase the likelihood of a low libido, but that does not mean that everyone with low testosterone will have a low sex drive.Despite this complexity, tube stations, bus stops and social media feeds are now festooned with adverts like: Low libido? Brain fog? Tired? Time to get a testosterone check! Has your man lost his spark? It might be his hormones!So, can testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) really offer a cure‑all for low libido?Testosterone 'gave me my life back'Melissa Green has been taking testosterone for nearly a year. She says it not only gave \"her zest for life\" back – it saved her marriage.The 43-year-old says her low sex drive was having a huge impact on their relationship.Being perimenopausal, her GP had already prescribed her oestrogen and progesterone through hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but Green says the GP would not test her testosterone levels, saying she did not need that extra hormone.The NHS says it follows guidance from the National Institute of Care Excellence which states that testosterone should only be considered for women following a trial of HRT and all other factors which explain low sexual desire have been excluded. Those with concerns should speak to their GP, they add.Eventually, Green went to a private clinic, had blood tests done, and was told her levels were low. After taking her results back to her GP, she now receives some testosterone on the NHS, and a small top up through a private prescription.\"It's given me my life back. In some ways, I feel like I'm back in my 20s,\" she says, \"I've got more energy, I feel sharper, and my sex drive has come back.\"Melissa GreenMelissa Green and her husband, MarcusWhile some are effusive about the impact testosterone has on libido, others say it has had less welcome effects.Cheryl O'Malley was on testosterone for a year. She says while it may have helped return some of the energy she had lost during the menopause, it also boosted her sex drive too much, and left her with feelings of intense rage.\"I was really horny. I wanted to have sex with my husband, but at the same time I hated him.\"That's when you know this is not a good place to be, this was not me, I felt out of control.\"Rachel Mason says when she posts about TRT she finds \"many women are so scared to start testosterone, they worry they will become manly, develop facial hair, lose themselves.\"Rachel Mason @raysecommunityRachel Mason says testosterone has been \"amazing\" for her Mason says she has a \"particularly hairy part\" of her wrist where she applies her testosterone gel on a daily basis, but that the benefits she gets from the hormone are worth it.Along with increased body hair, TRT can come with a range of other side effects. For women, the most common effects are excess hair growth, acne and weight gain, which are usually reversible with reduction in dosage or discontinuation. Alopecia and deepening of the voice are rare with testosterone replacement.For men, it can cause side effects such as weight gain, painful and prolonged erections, male pattern baldness and mood swings. It can also lead to lower sperm production which can impact fertility. There are treatments that can help, but medical advice is recommended.'It's a gravy train'Some NHS GPs and secondary care consultants have told the BBC that private clinics are profiteering by selling TRT as a quick fix to a complicated problem.Dr Paula Briggs, an NHS consultant in sexual and reproductive health, describes it as a \"gravy train\" where people end up paying a lot of money for something they do not need.\"It's out of control,\" she says. \"The wellbeing industry has created this gap in the market they're using to their advantage.\"It's abusive.\"Private clinics, however, say they are improving people's lives by offering a service that the NHS is failing to provide.Jeff Foster, an NHS GP and medical director at Voy, a multi-million pound clinic specialising in men's health, says the private sector is filling a gap in care.\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone.\"TRT is offered via the NHS with most clinics functioning under either endocrinology or urology.Michael Kocsis has been offering TRT through his company, Balance My Hormones, since 2016. He says that he's seen demand grow \"exponentially\" over the past few years.Kocsis says some of his patients have gone through the NHS to be tested, and been told they do not have low levels of testosterone, so have decided to go private.\"Just because their level of testosterone might be a bit higher than the threshold set by the NHS, does not mean that TRT can't help them.\"It's not black and white, it's more nuanced than that.\"AFP via Getty Images\"Right now, the NHS is not currently set up to diagnose or treat the thousands of men who may have low testosterone,\" says Jeff Foster, a medical director at VoyFor men, testosterone starts to decrease by around 1% from the age of 30 to 40. NHS advice states that this is a normal part of ageing and is unlikely to affect libido.Alan Reeves initially received TRT on the NHS. Two tests showed levels of 10nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) and 12nmol/L, and he was given a course of four injections, three weeks apart. But after his fourth treatment, Reeves was told it could no longer continue, \"without much of an explanation.\"\"I was back to square one,\" he explains. \"That's when I decided to go private.\"Alan Reeves @coachalreevesAlan Reeves is now a fitness and lifestyle coachSo, what is a healthy testosterone level for men? It differs depending on which organisation you ask and which study you read.Guidelines from the BSSM, which have been interpreted from major international studies, suggest that men with less than 12nmol/L, should be considered for TRT and will probably be showing symptoms of hypogonadism — a condition where the testes are not producing enough of this vital sex hormone.NHS guidance differs between trusts, but it states that a man with levels below 6 to 8nmol/L may have testosterone deficiency.For women, testosterone starts to decrease between the ages of 20 and 40 before it plateaus as they enter menopause. It's normal for levels to go down, but the question is how much that reduction has an impact on sex drive and overall wellbeing.There are tests available, but it's difficult to take accurate readings because, while testosterone is also vital for women, the amount needed is a lot less. And even if it is prescribed, it has to be given a \"off-label\" as there is currently no licensed treatments for women available on the NHS.More from InDepthBriggs is wary of the buzz around TRT. She says she has seen a huge surge in patients telling her they need testosterone because they feel low and not in the mood for sex anymore.\"They tell me they've done their research. Often that means they have seen the life changing impact this hormone has had on someone posting about it on social media.\"Just because it works for a celeb does not mean it works for the general population.\"She says GPs in her local area, Cheshire and Merseyside, are inundated with patients asking for testosterone checks. There are many, she says, that will leave with a TRT prescription, only to come back a few months later and say it's had very little impact.While it does help some people, she says, the proportion of those who say they need testosterone, and who will actually benefit from it, is small. Clinical evidence so far when it comes to women, suggests that TRT is only effective for treating those who are postmenopausal with low libido.Briggs says advertising by private clinics has \"blown everything out of proportion.\"\"I'm not against TRT when it's needed, what I am against is seeing it so over-promoted.\"GP Ben Davis also warns that TRT can have a placebo effect, leaving patients sometimes taking and paying for medication privately, that they do not need.Cheryl O'Malley has stopped taking testosterone. She says the intense anger and heightened sexual arousal she experienced during treatment have subsided, and her libido has returned to a level that feels comfortable for her.\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it,\" she says.'It's not a silver bullet'\"For some, medication can be really transformative,\" Davis says, but he adds that it is more than just handing out medication.\"GPs might not have time to discuss with a patient what is behind their low sex drive, could it be their relationship with their partner, could it be how they view themselves, could it be the sex they are currently having is longer turning them on?\"He says that there are so many factors that play into a low libido and testosterone is not the only answer.Cheryl O'Malley\"I'm so relieved I stopped taking it [testosterone],\" says Cheryl O'Malley Alan Reeves, however, has been on TRT for seven years now and is prescribed testosterone by the private clinic, Balance My Hormones. He says his life has dramatically improved.\"My libido came back, so much so at first, I wanted sex every night for 10 nights.\"But now that's calmed down and I am just in a good place.\"Nonetheless, Reeves believes \"it is not a silver bullet\" and there is no point in taking testosterone without making other changes to your lifestyle.Otherwise, he says, it's like putting a Ferrari engine in a \"clapped out car\".\"I walk… taller now, that's partly down to testosterone, partly down to me.\"Additional reporting: Nat WrightTop picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (13:15-15:15)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in Tuesday's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Before them (09:15-11:15) the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "4 hours agoJoe PikePolitical correspondent, Gorton and DentonBBCLongsight, in the Gorton and Denton constituency, where campaigning is in full swingSir Keir Starmer's grip on power is weak and while the PM has consolidated his position after Labour's leader in Scotland called for him to quit, there are dangers lurking in the weeks ahead.May's Scottish, Welsh and local elections are the moment many Labour MPs predict Sir Keir could be challenged if results are bad for the party.But a contest in a south-east corner of Greater Manchester - the Gorton and Denton by-election - is taking place at the end of this month and could be just as perilous for the PM.Labour won more than half the vote here just 18 months ago, but since then MP Andrew Gwynne was suspended after offensive text messages he had sent were published and he has now resigned from parliament.The region's mayor Andy Burnham saw this contest as an opportunity - a route back to Westminster and perhaps even the Labour leadership. But Burnham was blocked by Keir Starmer and Labour's ruling committee.Instead, local councillor Angeliki Stogia has been selected as the Labour candidate. Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia is a local councillorShe moved to Manchester from Greece 30 years ago, and tells me she wants to win to stop what she calls the \"division\" offered by Reform UK.We meet in a park and sit under a cafe's gazebo to escape the rain. Like some of the other candidates I speak to, Stogia is fizzing with nervous energy.The relentless pace and scrutiny of a by-election with hustings, media appearances and hours of door-knocking is unlike any other political campaign.It takes a few times of me asking to get clarity over whether Stogia thinks Starmer is a good prime minister - she does.He has yet to visit the campaign and when I ask if he's on Stogia's leaflets, it sounds like he's not. \"I am at the heart of my leaflets,\" she insists.Reform UK's Matt Goodwin is an academic turned GB News presenterReform UK have taken over an industrial unit in the corner of a business park to be its campaign headquarters.Once you get past the security guard on the door, a cavernous space is revealed. There is an enormous union flag, piles of leaflets, and images of Nigel Farage alongside the party's candidate Matt Goodwin.Once a professor who studied right-wing politicians, Goodwin has now been tempted to try and become one. He is also a columnist and presenter on GB News.He argues that Labour has taken voters here for granted and has strong opinions on immigration and integration.When I raise his comments in a recent blog that \"Trump is right. Europe is facing civilizational erasure\", Goodwin shoots back: \"Do you not have concerns about the direction of Europe? … We have very real problems with the pace of change in Western nations.\"The name Gorton and Denton really doesn't sum up this slightly bodged-together assortment of communities, which also includes Levenshulme, and Burnage - once the home of Oasis's Gallagher brothers.Green Hannah Spencer is a councillor - and a qualified plumberThere are up-and-coming streets with nice cafes and grocery shops but also places where units are shuttered. Relative child poverty here is twice the national UK average.Political scientist Rob Ford describes the seat as \"a tale of two Manchesters on opposite edges of Labour's unravelling electoral coalition\".One side of this oddly-shaped constituency is home to lots of university students and graduates and the population is 40% Muslim. The other part of the constituency is 83% white, with many in low-paying jobs.Lots of people I speak to complain about littering and fly-tipping. Some seem pretty vulnerable.One man I met at a cafe said he didn't want to be interviewed, but explained he was in his twenties, unemployed and living with his grandparents. He said his dad was in prison and mum was a drug user. He asked for reassurance that things would work out for him.Gaza's future remains an important issue for the Green Party and Palestinian flags are emblazoned on a lot of their leaflets.The Greens are optimistic about their chances of taking the seat.Their candidate, Hannah Spencer, was more than an hour late to meet us after getting stuck in traffic on the way back from a plastering course. She is already a qualified plumber.I asked her about comments she made online a few years ago that she was \"glad\" to move out of the area and that it was full of \"money laundering takeaways\".Spencer responds matter-of-factly: \"Like a lot of people, it's taken me a while to become proud of the places I've lived. I've struggled a lot in the years that I was here... I think that's the feeling that a lot of people share.\"Tory hopeful Charlotte Cadden is a former police officerFormer police officer Charlotte Cadden is the Conservative candidate. She used to lead the team that helps protect MPs. Now she wants to be one.Although her party came second here in the 2019 election, they were pushed into fifth place in 2024.Can she actually win? \"I'm not ruling anything out,\" Cadden says. \"I have got 30 years in policing, I've worked in this area. I live here… It might be overambitious, but I think we're going to do very well.\"A lot has changed since Labour's solid victory here in 2024. And the fact the result here seems so unpredictable is evidence of the precariousness of the PM's position.",

    "body": "Gender pay gap won't close for another 30 years, warns union23 minutes agoJosh MartinPAThe gender pay gap is prominent even in industries where women make up the majority of employees, such as health and social careMoves to close the gender pay gap won't be successful until 2056 if progress remains at its current rate, according to the Trades Union Congress (TUC).The disparity between average wages for men and women is 12.8%, or £2,548 per year, according to TUC analysis of official pay data. It is widest in the finance and insurance industry, at 27.2%. In the leisure service sector it was only 1.5%.Pay disparity between genders meant that the average woman employee \"effectively works for 47 days of the year for free,\" the TUC said.The gender pay gap measures the difference in salaries paid to men and women in the same industries. Employers with more than 250 UK staff must report pay data.Even in industries where woman make up a majority of the workforce, such as education and health and social care, the gender pay gaps are 17% and 12.8%, respectively.TUC general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"Women have effectively been working for free for the first month and a half of the year compared to men.\"With the cost of living still biting hard, women simply can't afford to keep losing out. They deserve their fair share\".Nowak pointed to the recent Employment Rights Act as a \"an important step forward for pay parity\" but said the government needed increase access to paid parental leave so \"mums and dads can better share care\".The gender pay gap is widest for workers aged 50-59, which the union argues is partly due to the long-term effects of women pausing or reducing their career ambitions and pay to prioritise caring responsibilities.The TUC wants improved access to flexible working and better access to childcare in order to help close the gap.Throughout the debate around increasing workers rights under the Employment Rights Act business groups argued that increased benefits and leave provisions would heap costs on to them and reduce their willingness to increase headcount.Employers will soon have to publish plans for how they plan to reduce the gender pay gap.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoel Gunter, in JerusalemandFiona NimoniGettyHamas and Israel have both repeatedly accused each other of breaching a ceasefire agreement Eleven Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Gaza on Sunday morning, according to Palestinian civil defence and health officials.The IDF said it had struck terror targets in response to ceasefire violations by Hamas, and that militants had been killed after emerging from a tunnel into the area of the strip controlled by the Israeli military.The Palestinian Red Crescent said a strike on a tent encampment in northern Gaza killed at least six people, while another strike in the south of the strip killed five.Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of near-daily violations of a fragile ceasefire agreement since it took effect on 10 October.The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said at least 600 people have been killed since the ceasefire went into effect. The latest strikes came as the preparations continued for the implementation of the second phase of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement. Last month, US President Donald Trump announced a new body called the Board of Peace, which has a mandate from the United Nations Security Council to establish an international force tasked with securing border areas in Gaza, and overseeing the disarmament of Hamas. The board, which was due to have its first meeting in Washington on 19 February, will also oversee the formation of a new technocratic Palestinian government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction.The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,820 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.Elsewhere, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu travelled to Washington on Wednesday to meet US President Donald Trump, where they discussed ways to curb Iran's nuclear programme - which Tehran has always insisted is for purely civilian purposes. Netanyahu was expected to press Trump to pursue an agreement that would halt Iran's uranium enrichment, as well as cutting its ballistic missile programme. However, Trump later said there was \"nothing definitive reached\" and that talks with Iran would continue. More on this story ",

    "body": "Labour think tank commissioned firm that ended up investigating journalist2 hours agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentUK ParliamentJosh Simons previously said he had asked the firm to look into a \"suspected illegal hack\" which was unrelated to any UK journalistA Labour group which helped Sir Keir Starmer get elected as Labour leader commissioned a report that investigated the personal and religious background of a Sunday Times journalist, the BBC understands.Labour Together paid APCO Worldwide at least £30,000 to \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins\" of a story about undeclared donations at the think tank before the general election.It delivered a report, codenamed \"Operation Cannon\", which included claims about a journalist who wrote the story and his faith, relationships and upbringing.Sources told the BBC the US public affairs firm's report included information about journalist Gabriel Pogrund's Jewish beliefs and claims about his ideological position. It also claimed, the sources said, that Pogrund's previous reporting, including on the royal family, \"could be seen as destabilising to the UK and also in the interests of Russia's strategic foreign policy objectives\".Pogrund is currently the Sunday Times Whitehall editor, and was named Political Journalist of the Year and News Journalist of the Year at the 2025 Press Awards.The report was allegedly prepared by a former Sunday Times employee who now works for APCO Worldwide.It was commissioned by the then-head of Labour Together, Josh Simons, who is now a Cabinet Office minister.Josh Simons said APCO Worldwide had gone beyond what was asked of them and welcomed an investigation launched by the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA).\"I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund. I asked for this information to be removed before passing the report to GCHQ,\" he said.In a contract addressed to Simons, seen by BBC News, APCO Worldwide agreed to investigate \"the sourcing, funding and origins\" of the Sunday Times reporting, as well as the journalist, Paul Holden, who has since published a critical book on Starmer and his former chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, and Matt Taibbi, an American reporter.McSweeney was a former head of Labour Together.A redacted version of the report, with the details about Pogrund removed, was passed to the National Cyber Security Centre because of the concerns about the hack, sources close to Simons said. They added he had not shared the report with anyone else outside of Labour Together.Alison Phillips, the CEO of Labour Together, and who joined after the APCO report was commissioned and delivered, said: \"I am committed to ensuring Labour Together aspires to the highest standards of probity at all times.\"We stand ready to support the PRCA [and other relevant governance bodies] with its review of this issue.\"Some Labour MPs have expressed their concerns about the story.Karl Turner, the Labour MP for East Hull, said the prime minister should look into the matter.\"Plausible deniability is only plausible until it isn't,\" he posted on X.The former shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, said he had repeatedly asked Labour's general secretary, Hollie Ridley, for an independent inquiry into the claims.\"[It's] clear to me as Secretary of the NUJ's [National Union of Journalist's] Parliamentary Group if true this is unacceptable,\" he posted.",

    "body": "14 hours agoMax MatzaGetty ImagesObama seen on the campaign trail in November 2025Former US President Barack Obama has indirectly addressed a racist video posted on President Donald Trump's social media, telling a podcast host that the \"shame\" and \"decorum\" that once guided public officials is now lost.The offensive video included a clip depicting Obama and his wife Michelle as apes, which drew widespread criticism from Democrats and Republicans. The White House initially defended the video, calling backlash \"fake outrage\". The post was later blamed on a staff member and deleted.Obama spoke to liberal podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen, who asked the first black US president about the tone of political discourse. Cohen cited Trump's post among several recent controversies. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was included at the end of a video Trump's Truth Social account shared containing unfounded claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. The post led to outrage from politicians, including from senior members of Trump's Republican party.Senator Tim Scott - the only black Republican senator - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The clip recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys, and appears to have been taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October.Trump has told reporters that he \"didn't see\" the part of the video that showed the Obamas.\"I didn't make a mistake,\" he told reporters when asked whether he planned to apologise.The 47-minute podcast featuring Obama was released on Saturday. The episode begins with the host asking him to comment on US \"discourse\", which he says \"has devolved to a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before\".Cohen notes claims by the White House that the \"victims\" of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are \"domestic terrorists\", and adds \"just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face, on an ape's body\".Obama responds by saying: \"It's important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.\"It is true that it gets attention.

    "body": "7 days agoMolly ArmstrongBBC ScotlandCaroline CronjaegerCaroline Cronjaeger is writing her dissertation on a book she discovered on YouTubeWhen Amy Laird  discovered she was spending seven hours a day on her phone, she said it was her \"rock bottom\" moment. The 18-year-old student turned to BookTok - a community of book lovers on TikTok - in her bid to reduce her screentime. She is not the only young person to spend hours glued to her screen - statistics suggest 18 to 24-year-olds average six hours and 20 minutes online every day. And less than a third of young Scots say they enjoy reading in their spare time. But could social media trends like BookTok persuade them to put down their phones, and pick up a book instead? BookTok is a TikTok community where users share book reviews, recommendations, and literature-themed content such as \"what would Lizzy Bennet wear?\"It is especially popular for genres like romance, young adult fiction and \"romantasy,\" often turning older books into sudden bestsellers.Some of the most popular BookTok videos have more than eight million interactions.Rebecca Yarros has found success with books including Onyx Storm, part of her Empyrean series which is currently being adapted for TV.Meanwhile, Sarah J. Maas has developed a cult following, particularly for A Court of Thorns and Roses.Amy LairdAmy has made reading a regular habit since finding BookTokAmy felt she was spending so much time on her phone, she was missing out on real life experiences. \"I was averaging about seven hours a day and thought I'm experiencing life through this device where reality is being curated for me,\" she told BBC News.Since turning to BookTok, she has made reading a regular habit.\"On average, I'd say I read every other day, even if it's just 10 pages of a novel per night,\" she said.\"My favourite books are Pride and Prejudice, The Handmaid's Tale and Gone With the Wind.\"Some BookTok videos have racked up eight million \"likes\"UK adults spend four hours and 30 minutes online each day, according to a 2025 report by Ofcom - 10 minutes more than in 2024.People aged 18 to 24 were found to be most active online, averaging six hours and 20 minutes daily.A study by the National Literacy Trust found that in Scotland only three in 10 people from the age of eight to 18 enjoyed reading in their free time and  one in six read daily in their free time.Isabella Potamitis BriozzoIsabella reads for hours before she goes to bedBookTok helped decrease screen time for 19‑year‑old student Isabella Potamitis Briozzo.\"I usually read for two to two-and-a-half hours before I go to bed,\" she said. \"And if I have any spare time I try to read as much as I can.\"Isabella discovered her favourite series - The Caraval by Stephanie Garber - through BookTok and \"just got addicted immediately\".\"Some of my favourite books come from BookTok,\" she said. \"Usually over the holidays, I tend to go days where I just read and that's all I do, it's just something that helps me relax,\" she added.James GreenJames like to use BookTok to get summaries of booksJames Green, a 20-year-old student at Manchester Metropolitan University, has recently being diagnosed with ADHD.He recognises that his attention difficulties exist without social media, but believes platforms like BookTok can genuinely help rebuild reading habits. \"It definitely helped me and inspired me to read more,\" he said.  \"It actually helped me put down my phone, because it made me want to read a lot more.\"He added: \"Short form content is helpful in giving a useful but concise insight into different books, which is why it is a good way to form a reading habit\"Meanwhile Caroline Cronjaeger, a 25-year-old student, is writing her dissertation on Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway - a book she found on YouTube.\"I read quite a lot, from two to three hours day,\" she said.\"Even more if I have a lot of free time and a really good book in my hands.\"Mrs Dalloway is also the reason why I chose to study English literature.\"",

Dumfries and Galloway Council also approved a community asset transfer in 2019, which paved the way to realise its \"inclusive community vision\".Stories you may have missedThe report recognised the park for its strong community engagement, sensory‑rich play and accessibility.Now its model for \"small‑scale, high‑impact transformation\" could be replicated across the world.Dr Andrzej Zieleniec is chairman of Include Us, which runs the park. He said the recognition was very welcome.\"I think it is amazing that a wee park in Dumfries has come to the attention and been recognised in such a prestigious report,\" he said.\"Being featured in this report positions Catherine Street Inclusive Park as a significant contribution to global thinking on inclusive urban design.\"It demonstrates how local, community‑driven initiatives can inform international policy and practice.\"Include UsSites in Jakarta, Barcelona and Nairobi were highlighted alongside Dumfries in the reportThe park is close to Dumfries town centre, across from its main library and Dumfries AcademyDevelopment manager, Lisa Callander-Bone, said they were \"honoured\" to feature in the report.\"It demonstrates that when communities come together with purpose and imagination, we can create places that change lives, not just here in Dumfries, but as part of a wider global story about inclusion, equity and children's rights,\" she said.\"This accolade is for all who have supported our inclusion vision.\"",

    "body": "'Fast-spreading' measles outbreak hits several schools in London3 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesHealth experts warn measles spreads very easily and can cause serious health complicationsAt least 34 children have been infected by a \"fast-spreading\" measles outbreak in several north London schools, health officials have said.The cases from Enfield were confirmed in laboratory tests in January, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported.A local GP surgery said one in five children who contracted the illness had been admitted to hospital, all of whom \"had not been fully immunised\".Families have been urged to ensure their children are up to date with their immunisations against the highly contagious disease, which can cause serious health complications.Enfield's NHS Ordnance Unity Centre For Health said on its website that there was a \"fast-spreading measles outbreak in several schools\" across the borough.It said infections had been confirmed in \"at least\" seven schools in Enfield and neighbouring Haringey.Enfield Councillor Alev Cazimoglu said the current outbreak had \"mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital\".She added: \"Vaccination is the most effective way to protect yourself and your family. We urge everyone who is not fully vaccinated to act now.\"Enfield Council said it was was working closely with the UKHSA, the NHS and local partners to limit further spread in accordance with national public health guidance.Dr Vanessa Saliba from the UKHSA said the \"big\" outbreak was \"mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries\".She said: \"Measles is a nasty illness for any child, but for some it can lead to long term complications and tragically death, but is so easily preventable with two doses of the MMRV [measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox] vaccine.\"Children who had missed doses should \"catch up as soon as possible\" to protect themselves and other children who are too young to be vaccinated or unable to do so for health reasons, she added.Dr Saliba also urged those travelling abroad over the Easter holidays to check their vaccination status because \"measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK, and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe\".Measles cases have been rising in the UK and in parts of the globe, with the increase blamed in part on poor uptake of the vaccine.UKHSA figures for 2024-25 showed that 84.4% of children across the UK had received two MMR doses by their fifth birthday. The recommended figure is 95%.The figure was 84.5% in 2023-24, down from a high of 88.8% reached in 2014-15.In January, the World Health Organization announced the UK had lost its measles elimination status following outbreaks in 2024.What is measles and what are the symptoms?Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes or by touching things that someone with measles has coughed or sneezed on.high feversore, red and watery eyescoughingsneezingSmall white spots may appear inside the mouth.A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically behind the ears and on the face, before spreading.The rash may be harder to detect on brown and black skin.",

    "body": "Just nowJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterBBCForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper spoke to Laura Kuenssberg from a conference in MunichThe UK wants action taken following evidence Russia killed political prisoner Alexei Navalny with frog poison, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.Two years ago, Russian opposition leader Navalny, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, died suddenly in the the Siberian prison where he was being held on trumped-up charges. European labs have now confirmed he died from the obscure poison, which Cooper says only the Russian government had the \"means, motive and opportunity\" to use.She told the BBC proof of the toxin was a \"clear breach\" of international chemical weapons rules and \"we do want to see action\" taken, which could include continuing coordinated sanctions on Russia. Cooper is currently attending the Munich Security Conference alongside Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, where the pair have been calling for European allies to be ready to fight, particularly against threats from Russia.Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she was asked what the consequences would be after evidence showed the Kremlin was responsible for Navalny's death.Speaking from a snow-covered Munich rooftop, Cooper said Britain and its allies must be ready to face down Russian aggression, which includes \"the use of lethal toxins against their own citizens\".\"We have been pursuing the truth on this since Alexei died in prison,\" she said, in an effort to continue Navalny's work to \"tell the truth, spread the truth\" about the Russian regime under Putin, \"because that is the most dangerous weapon of all\".\"He is no longer able to do that, but that is why we are continuing to do that for him, and for his widow as well,\" she added.Moscow has previously claimed Navalny died of natural causes, although Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya has consistently argued her husband was \"murdered\" by poisoning.The tests - carried out by five European countries using samples from his body smuggled out of the prison - showed the substance that killed him was developed from the toxin found in Ecuadorian dart frogs. The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Navalny's death and described the announcement as \"feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists\" and accused critics of \"necro-propaganda\".However, Cooper told Kuenssberg the use of poison \"is evidence of the aggression that is unfortunately going to be continuing\" against Europe \"and we need to be ready to respond to that\".\"A group of European ministers has now reported this to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for them to pursue because we see this as a clear breach of the chemical weapons international rules and convention so we do want to see action there, holding some accountability,\" she said. Asked what specific action could be taken by the UK, Cooper said:  \"We continue to look at co-ordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime.\"As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.\"We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.\"Also appearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel called on the government to \"step up its own actions\" against Russia because sanctions are \"being busted and circumvented\".Speaking from the conference in Munich, she said: \"Action needs to be taken against Russia, there's no doubt about that, and you will recall when Alexei Navalny was murdered back in 2024 it was our government that led the way in terms of sanctions, taking drastic action, calling for the transparent investigation of his murder.  \"We need to do much more, I think, when it comes to action against Russia.\"We really need to take direct action against some of the individuals in the UK, the ambassador again needs to be called in.\"Dame Priti argued for \"cutting off all the financial flows that are basically still propping up Russia and the Russian economy\", including closing down Russian oil refineries.\"We've got to target those businesses and go after them,\" she said. \"We've really got to start taking direct action against these financial lifelines that basically are propping up Russia, the Russian state, and this awful permissive Russian activity that we're seeing, including the state sponsored murders and assassinations that the Russian state is so heavily involved in.\"A statement from the Russian embassy in London has continued to deny all involvement in Navalny's death, stating: \"There is no reason whatsoever to credit such 'findings' by Western 'experts'. \"As with the Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore. \"So what was it in the end - poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or Novichok?\"The statement added: \"We have become accustomed to the feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.\"Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by Western politicians - necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead.\"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.\"",

    "body": "Iran retaliation raises questions about US air defences42 minutes agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentGetty ImagesVideos appear to show missiles and drones striking the vicinity of the US Fifth Fleet headquarters in BahrainIran has targeted the US Navy base in Bahrain, highlighting gaps in air defences, which will worry Washington and its allies in the region.Videos appear to show missiles and drones striking the vicinity of the US Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain.As yet there are no reports of casualties. The US military will likely have had some warning of the attack and taken precautions to evacuate personnel.Tom Sharpe, a former Royal Navy Commander, says Bahrain was likely seen by Iran as a high profile target that has, in the past, had relatively little in the way of air defences.That now appears to have been highlighted by video showing a relatively slow-moving Iranian Shahed drone breaching its defences. In Ukraine such drones can often be shot down with a simple high calibre machine-gun.Over the past few weeks, the US is reported to have flown out additional air defence systems to the region - including sophisticated THAAD and Patriot Systems - which can shoot down ballistic missiles. But these are expensive and limited in numbers. For context, Ukraine has fewer than 10 Patriot batteries and still struggles to defend the capital, Kyiv. It is still unlikely the US has sufficient numbers to protect all its military bases  and interests it has in the Middle East.The US Navy has also deployed around a dozen Arleigh Burke-class Destroyers to the Gulf and the eastern Mediterranean. These air defence destroyers can also shoot down drones and ballistic missiles. They have already proven effective in the Red Sea against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. Between 2024 and 2026, the US intercepted nearly 400 Houthi drones and missiles.US fighters jets, which have been sent to the region, are also capable of intercepting drones and missiles. The US now has more than 100 jets in the region.But even these significant capabilities are unlikely to be enough to prevent Iran from successfully striking some targets. Before these latest US and Israeli strikes, Iran still probably had an arsenal of around 2,000 short-range of ballistic missiles. It has many more one-way attack drones.Iran's Shahed drone has been exported to Russia and continues to cause havoc across Ukraine. Russia is now producing thousands of these drones a month and has likely given Iran help to advance its technical capabilities.Sharpe says that during his time in the Royal Navy, they conducted war games simulating an Iranian attack on military basses in the Middle East. In some scenarios missiles and drones would inevitably find their way through limited air defences.\"If the Iranians unleash everything - go hard and fast if the regime feels threatened,  then eventually the US will run out of THAAD and Patriot interceptors,\" he says.Sharpe also says that Iran's drones and missile capabilities \"are massively dispersed\".But Edmund Fitton-Brown, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies - a US-based research institute focusing on foreign policy - says there may be evidence that the Iranians, while willing to retaliate, may not want to escalate this into a wider conflict.He says it is still unclear how much the attacks by the US and Israel last year damaged some of Iran's military capabilities.\"The early signs are that the Iranian retaliation has been rather moderate in scope,\" he adds.It is worth remembering that after a year of targeting the Houthis in Yemen, the US had damaged but not destroyed its ability to launch missiles and drones. Getty ImagesIran's Shahed drone has caused havoc across UkraineWars fought from the air alone rarely achieve conclusive victories or regime change.The Nato-led bombing campaign on Libya in 2011 may be a rare exception, though in that case case chaos ensued.Iran also has significant capabilities to attack the US Navy - if in range. It has large stocks of anti-ship missiles, as well as small, fast, uncrewed attack boats. There is also the unanswered question of whether China may have given Iran military support over the past few months.Daniel Byman, from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, says that early strikes may damage Iran's leadership and military assets, but the US \"may struggle to sustain operations while Iran's main path to survival is simply to endure\".Ukraine is a reminder of the importance of air defences. It continues to be the number one request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to allies.Ukraine also shows how hard it is to defend against multiple complex attacks involving hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles. The US has more resources and along with Israel will be targeting Iran's drone and missile factories and launch sites.But eradicating that threat won't be easy. A prolonged conflict will not just be a challenge for Iran, but also for the stocks and supplies of US weapons - in a war far from home.",

    "body": "US and Israeli strikes on Iran in maps2 hours agoThe US and Israel have attacked Iran, hitting targets across the country. The office of Iran's supreme leader in the capital Tehran is among the targets, as well as military sites across the country.Iran has launched retaliatory strikes at Israel and US bases across the region.Several verified videos from Tehran show large plumes of smoke rising above the capital.BBC Verify has obtained satellite imagery taken over the city on Saturday morning, which shows significant damage to part of the compound of Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The high resolution image, captured by Airbus, shows blackened buildings, debris and a column of smoke rising from the site.The location matches verified footage filmed in Tehran in the aftermath of explosions in the area.AirbusA satellite image shows black smoke rising above the compound of Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali KhameneiThere are also images showing that the Narmak neighbourhood, where former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lives, has been hit.Another strike hit the area around the ministry of intelligence. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its strikes in Tehran targeted locations where senior political and security figures were gathered.Strikes across IranThere are also reports of strikes elsewhere in the country.At least 85 people were killed at a girls' school in Minab in the south of the country, Iranian state media report. The Islamic Republic News Agency (Irna) cited a spokesman for the country's ministry of education saying that the school was \"targeted by three missile attacks\". The BBC has not been able to independently verify this - international news organisations are often refused visas to Iran which severely limits their ability to gather information about what's going on inside the country.Military sites have been targeted in Kermanshah, Qom, Isfahan, Tabriz and Karaj, as well as at Iranian naval facilities in Kenarak in the south of the country. A video sent to the BBC from the small city of Kamyaran shows that an IRGC base was bombed.The IDF has warned Iranian civilians to evacuate areas near military sites and installations ahead of the strikes.Where has Iran attacked?Iran has launched retaliatory strikes on Israel and US bases in the region. Explosions have been heard in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.The UAE's state news agency said one person had been killed after Iranian missiles were intercepted. Bahrain's National Communication Centre said the service centre of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet has been \"subjected to a missile attack\". It is responsible for operations across the Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and parts of the Indian Ocean.Also in Bahrain, one verified clip, filmed from a moving vehicle, shows the moment a missile strikes. An explosion follows, sending fragments and debris into the air.Other verified footage from Bahrain shows dark plumes of smoke rising as sirens sound across the city.The spokesperson for Kuwait's ministry of defence posted on X that the Ali Al-Salem airbase had been targeted by a number of ballistic missiles, but that Kuwaiti air defence forces had successfully intercepted them.Jordan, which borders Israel, said its armed forces shot down two ballistic missiles targeting its territory. An official told the AFP news agency there was no casualties but only material damage.",

    "body": "Inside Iran, panic as strikes hit but for some it's a moment of relief5 hours agoRobert GreenallBBC NewsBaran AbbasiBBC PersianVideos circulating on social media show people near the blast sites running in panic, with the sounds of screams and crying in the background.But, says BBC Persian, at the same time there appears to be a sense of relief - even celebration - among those who believe the regime's downfall can only come through military intervention.In one video, a woman speaks with unmistakable relief, saying Ayatollah Khamenei's residence has been hit. Another clip shows teenagers at a school dancing and chanting that the strikes have happened, adding, \"I love Trump.\"Many people had been anticipating a possible US attack. Since Friday night, long queues have formed at petrol stations, and many residents of the capital, Tehran, have begun leaving the city for the north, near the Caspian Sea, which they believe is safer.With Iran coming under an almost total internet blackout since the attacks started, it has been difficult to contact anyone inside the country. Some people briefly managed to access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks, and may be able to do so again.Getty ImagesMany residents have begun heading north from TehranThe BBC has, however, been able to reach a number of pro-regime figures who spoke about the situation in Tehran.\"We have heard lots of explosions. I live in middle of Tehran,\" one of them told BBC Newshour. \"This was a normal day until the United States and Israel started attacking the city. Our children have gone to a school in the morning. We had to go and get the children.\"Another told the BBC Weekend programme he heard fighter jets and two explosions early in the morning from his office in the north of the city. The atmosphere was tense and there was a sense of war in the air.He said that people were shopping and stocking up on canned food.One resident told BBC Persian via Starlink there was a heavy security presence on streets leading to the compound of the Leadership House, the office of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.Videos shared online show aftermath of strikes'Look after our children'Before the blackout, some people posted messages on social media in case they were killed in air strikes.\"If I die, don't forget that we exist too - those of us who oppose any military attack, those of us who will become just a number in reports of the dead,\" one Iranian wrote on social media.Another wrote: \"Damn the Islamic dictatorship that caused this war. We have already endured three wars.\"Some posts highlight the strain of communication and fear for children caught in the conflict: \"The internet is almost down... If the network is completely cut, know that we are not soldiers for any leader, nor collateral damage,\" said another user. \"We are human and have the right to live. Try to make our future democratic, not dependent on individuals.\"Another user wrote: \"Promise that if anything happens to us, you will look after our children and be very, very kind to them. Tell them we did everything we could - we joined silent marches, we voted, we worked multiple shifts, we endured great hardship.\"Others, however, fear that air strikes alone may not bring about the regime's collapse. They worry it could survive and, in response, become even more brutal towards its own people.Getty ImagesPeople in Iran are trying to find out news of the attacks amid an internet blackoutAt the time of protests more than a month ago in which thousands were killed, US President Donald Trump had encouraged Iranians to continue protesting, vowing that help was on the way. Now, some Iranians report receiving text messages reading, \"Help has come\" - urging people to stay at home and calling on regime forces to lay down their arms.But public sentiment could shift sharply if civilians are killed in the strikes, with many Iranians reacting with anger after state media reported that an Israeli strike on a girls' school killed dozens of people. There is no confirmation.An Iranian living abroad who opposes military intervention in Iran commented: \"The first victims of this war are 40 girls in Minab, hit by a missile attack. Is this the war you cheer for?\"Deep mistrust of the Iranian regime, however, makes official reports difficult for many to accept, and some Iranians directly blamed the regime for the attack.One user wrote: \"Even if the regime did not directly target schools, the deaths of children in Minab remain the responsibility of the Islamic Republic. \"People have no shelters, the internet is cut, phone lines are down, and there has been no warning to keep children out of school. In these conditions, the minimum requirement should be to stay at home.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoAleks PhillipsEPAAirlines serving the Middle East have cancelled or diverted flights after the US and Israel launched deadly strikes on Iran.British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Wizz Air are among carriers to pare back their schedules to destinations in the Middle East, citing safety concerns.Sites in Iran including in the capital, Tehran, have been targeted in the attacks on Saturday. Iran has been accused of launching retaliatory strikes on Israel and several other nations hosting US facilities in the region with civilian casualties.The UK Foreign Office has urged British nationals in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to immediately shelter in place following reports of explosions.US President Donald Trump cited a failure to reach an agreement to limit Iran's nuclear programme and regime change as among the reasons for launching the attack.Iranian airspace has been closed and flight tracking shows international air traffic avoiding the region.British Airways has cancelled services to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until Wednesday, and Amman in Jordan on Saturday.Passengers on the 20:00 flight to Doha on Friday returned to Heathrow after it turned back part way through the journey, but this was due to a technical issue with the aircraft and unrelated to the military action.Sarah Short was due to return from a holiday in Dubai to Heathrow on Saturday.\"We got on the plane and were literally about to taxi when the pilot said: 'We have some bad news - we're not going anywhere',\" she told the BBC. \"We then sat on the plane on the tarmac for over three hours.\"She added: \"There's no flights, everything's suspended. BA said there's nothing they can do,\" she said. \"It's all so volatile, you just don't know what's going to happen next.\"Virgin Atlantic cancelled a Heathrow to Dubai flight and warned its flights to India, Saudi Arabia and the Maldives may take longer due to being rerouted.Wizz Air suspended all flights to and from Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman up until and including next Saturday.Qatar Airways confirmed the temporary suspension of flights to and from its capital Doha due to the closure of Qatari airspace, while Emirates said it was temporarily stopping services to and from Dubai.Heathrow, the UK's busiest airport, urged travellers to check with their airline for updates.ReutersFlights that would have gone over the affected region have been diverted, causing delaysThe Foreign Office told British nationals in four Gulf states to seek shelter after explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Qatar's capital, Doha.John Henry, 71, from Northampton, who is on holiday with his family, was at a shopping centre when they got an air raid alert.\"We heard a bit of a thud and felt a tremor, and we saw a number of people moving quickly out of the shopping centre,\" he told the BBC. Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted Iranian missiles.\"You could see the vapour trails where they had hit,\" he said. \"We've heard four or five additional thuds where something must have happened,\" said Henry.The UAE also said it had intercepted Iranian missiles, while footage appears to show the moment a US facility in Bahrain was hit.UK nationals in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman have been told by the Foreign Office to \"remain vigilant\" and take shelter if advised to do so.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has chaired a Cobra meeting on the strikes earlier on Saturday.A government spokesperson said: \"Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance.\"Additional reporting by Marc Ashdown and Mary Litchfield",

    "body": "Bowen: A dangerous moment, but US and Israel see opportunity not to be missed8 hours agoJeremy BowenInternational editorChaotic scenes after strike hits Tehran neighbourhoodThe decision by the United States and Israel to plunge into a new war with Iran creates a highly dangerous moment with unpredictable consequences. Israel used the word \"pre-emptive\" to justify its attack.The evidence is that this is not a response to an imminent threat, which the word pre-emption implies. Instead, it is a war of choice. Israel and the United States have calculated that the Islamic regime in Iran is vulnerable; dealing with a severe economic crisis, the fallout from the brutal crackdown on protesters at the start of the year and with defences still badly damaged by last summer's war. Their conclusion seems to have been that this was an opportunity that should not be squandered.It is also another blow to the tottering system of international law. In their statements, both President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran was a danger to their countries – Trump said it was a global danger. The Islamic regime is certainly their bitter enemy. But it is hard to see how the legal justification of self-defence applies given the huge disparity of power between the US and Israel on one side and Iran on the other.ReutersSmoke rises above Tehran after strikeWar is a political act.  Armed conflict is inherently hard to control once it starts. Leaders need clear objectives.Benjamin Netanyahu has seen Iran as Israel's most dangerous enemy for decades. For him, this is a chance to do as much damage as possible to the regime in Tehran and to Iran's military capacity. Netanyahu also faces a general election later in the year. The evidence from the two years of war with Hamas is that he believes his political position strengthens when Israel is at war.Donald Trump's objectives have veered and changed, characteristically. Back in January, he told protesters in Iran that help was on its way. Much of the US Navy was busy removing the leader of Venezuela at the time, so he lacked military options. While the US was deploying two carrier strike groups to the region, as well as considerable land-based firepower, Trump talked a lot about the dangers of Iran's nuclear ambitions, even though after last summer's war, Trump declared that the Iranian nuclear programme had been \"obliterated\". The Iranian regime has always denied that it wants a nuclear weapon, but it has enriched uranium to a level that has no civilian use in a nuclear power programme. At the very least, it seems to want the option of building a bomb. So far Israel and the US have published no evidence that it was about to happen.In his video, Trump told Iranian people that \"the hour of freedom\" was at hand. Netanyahu had a similar message, that the war will present the people of Iran with the chance to overthrow the regime. That is not at all certain. There is no precedent for regime change happening just because of air strikes. Saddam Hussein of Iraq was overthrown in 2003 by a huge US-led invasion force. Muammar Gaddafi of Libya was overthrown in 2011 by rebel forces that were provided with an air force by Nato and some Arab states. In both cases the result was the collapse of the state, civil war and thousands of killings. Libya is still a failed state. Iraq is still dealing with consequences of the invasion and the bloodletting that followed.Even if this becomes the first case of air power alone collapsing a regime, the Islamic regime will not be replaced by a liberal democracy that upholds human rights. There is no credible alternative government in exile waiting in the wings. Over almost half a century the Iranian regime has created a complex political system that is underpinned by a mix of ideology, corruption and when required, the ruthless use of force. The Tehran regime demonstrated in January that it was prepared to kill protesters. It has security forces that obey orders to shoot and kill thousands of fellow citizens for challenging the system on the streets and demanding freedom.Watch: Trump announces 'major combat operations' in IranPerhaps the US and Israel are trying to kill the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Israel believes in the power of assassination as a strategy. In the last two years it killed the leaders of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and many of their lieutenants.The Islamic regime in Iran is a different matter. It presides over a state, not an armed movement. It is not a one-man show. If the supreme leader was killed, he would be replaced, most likely by another cleric supported by the Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), which exists alongside the conventional armed forces with the explicit task of defending the regime against threats at home and abroad.Trump offered them immunity if they laid down their arms or certain death. The IRGC is unlikely to be tempted by his offer. Martyrdom is a constant motif in the ideology of the Islamic Republic and in Shia Islam. Trump believes that the primary motivating force in politics and life is transactional – as his book puts it, the art of the deal. But dealing with Iran requires factoring in the power of ideology and belief. That is much harder to measure.As this crisis has built since the turn of the year, and America assembled its armada, there have been increasing signs that the leadership in Tehran saw war as unavoidable. They engaged in talks, conscious that talks were going on last summer when Israel attacked and the US joined them. They do not trust the US or the Israelis. In his first term Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, which restricted the Iranian nuclear programme and was the marquee foreign policy achievement of the Obama administration. There have been signs that Iran might have been prepared to accept a JCPOA mark two deal, at the very least to buy time. But the US appears to have also been demanding severe restrictions on its missile programme and its support for regional allies that oppose Israel and the US.That was unacceptable to them, amounting to a capitulation. Giving up missiles and allies might even in the minds of the leadership make it much more vulnerable to regime change than the threat – and now reality – of attack.Iran's leaders will now be calculating how to ride out the war, how to survive and how to manage its consequences. Their neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia, will be dismayed by the huge uncertainty and potential consequences of today's events. Given the capacity of the Middle East to export trouble, the eruption of renewed and intensified war deepens the instability of a region and wider world that is already turbulent, violent and dangerous.",

Thick black smoke rises into the sky.Dubai authorities also said four people were injured in a blaze at a building in the Palm Jumeirah area, and that the fire was brought under control. The statement did not go into further detail on the incident.Elsewhere in the region, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Kuwait - all home to US military bases - said they had intercepted missiles fired towards them.Huge plumes of black smoke were seen rising from an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain. The extent of any damage is unclear and the US has not commented.In Doha, Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted several missiles apparently targeting the al-Udeid air base, the largest US base in the region.Large smoke plumes could be seen rising above the five-star luxury hotel as emergency services attended the scene.Iranian media earlier said that it had launched an attack on Dubai, although it is not clear what they are targeting.The UAE ministry of defence said in a statement on X that it intercepted a number of drones and missiles, and called the Iranian strikes a \"blatant violation of national sovereignty and international law\".ReutersPlumes of black smoke were seen rising above an area near the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth FleetThe US has about 13 military bases across the Middle East, with 30,000 to 40,000 troops normally deployed between them. Authorities in Bahrain confirmed the attack on the US naval base, known officially as Naval Support Activity Bahrain. It is the home port for ships including anti-mine vessels and logistical support ships, though it is unclear if any were present.Video from Bahrain's capital, Manama, shows the moment a drone hits a tower block, exploding into a brilliant yellow fireball.Explosions were heard in Kuwait, and the local news agency Kuna said that a drone targeting the international airport caused \"minor injuries to several employees\" with \"limited\" damage to a terminal.In Doha, Qatar, explosions were seen apparently targeting the al Udeid air base, the largest American military base in the region.Footage also showed dozens of people fleeing from a falling missile in a residential area. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it condemned the \"targeting of Qatari territory with Iranian ballistic missiles\", which it said was \"a flagrant violation of its national sovereignty\" and an \"unacceptable escalation\". US air defences shot down a drone over a US military base near Erbil, Iraq, the Reuters news agency reports.Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said in a statement it was targeting US bases and assets as part of operation \"Truthful Promise 4\", in retaliation for the attack on Iran launched by the US and Israel on Saturday morning. That attack - launched at approximately 09:30 Tehran time (06:00 GMT) - has so far targeted areas linked to the Iranian leadership, with US President Donald Trump encouraging the Iranian people to rise up against the regime. Drone strikes tower block in Bahrain's capitalThe strait is considered to be one of the world's most significant maritime trade routes and a crucial chokepoint for oil transit. Approximately one fifth of the world's oil and gas passes through it.In Israel, sirens have been activated across the country throughout Saturday - with its military saying numerous rounds of missiles had been launched at it by Iran, and that its air force is working to intercept them. In neighbouring Jordan, the armed forces said they had shot down two ballistic missiles targeting its territory, with authorities saying there were no casualties. The defence ministry of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said in a statement that the country has been subjected to a \"a blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\".\"UAE air defence systems dealt with the missiles with high efficiency and successfully intercepted a number of missiles,\" it added. It said debris fell on a residential area in Abu Dhabi, causing some material damage and killing a civilian. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi condemned the attack by the US and Israel as \"wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate\", and said Iran's armed forces \"are prepared for this day and will teach the aggressors the lesson they deserve\".Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "1 hour agoFiona NimoniandIain Watson,Political correspondentUK ParliamentLabour MP Josh Simons has resigned as a Cabinet Office minister, just days after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer asked his ethics adviser to investigate him. Simons faced claims the think tank he used to run before he became an MP commissioned a report that looked into the background of journalists.Confirming his resignation on X, the Labour MP said he had \"become a distraction from this government's important work\". Sir Keir said he had accepted the resignation \"with sadness\", adding that ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus found Simons had not breached the ministerial code.\"I want to express my thanks for the commitment, focus, and energy you have brought to ministerial office,\" Sir Keir added. Labour Together paid APCO Worldwide at least £30,000 to \"investigate the sourcing, funding and origins\" of a Sunday Times story about undeclared donations at the think tank ahead of the 2024 election.The US public affairs firm's report included information about journalist Gabriel Pogrund's Jewish beliefs and claims about his ideological position.The BBC has not seen APCO Worldwide's report in full, but sources familiar with its contents have confirmed the details, which were reported by the Sunday Times.It also claimed, the sources said, that Pogrund's previous reporting, including on the Royal Family, \"could be seen as destabilising to the UK and also in the interests of Russia's strategic foreign policy objectives\".A contract addressed to Simons, seen by the BBC, also agreed to investigate journalist Paul Holden and Matt Taibbi, an American reporter.Simons, 32, had previously said the company which did the research for Labour Together had \"gone beyond\" what it was asked to do.In a letter to the prime minister, ethics adviser Sir Laurie said Simons now accepted the terms he agreed with APCO Worldwide were \"wider than he had understood\" and he had acted \"too hastily in confirming their appointment\".Sir Laurie said Simons had acted \"in good faith\" but added that the MP acknowledged the \"perceived gap between his public statements and what he now accepts appears to be a more extensive scope has been damaging\".More than 20 Labour MPs had called for a \"fully independent investigation\" into Simons and the report.Labour Together has been widely credited with helping Sir Keir Starmer get elected as Labour leader.Allies of Simons have told the BBC he regretted what had happened but APCO had to take responsibility for its actions and so far had not.They said he had put his party first by resigning but had never sought to smear journalists.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused Sir Keir of using the strikes in the Middle East to try and \"sneak out yet another ministerial resignation\".\"Josh Simons was in charge of a group that deliberately smeared journalists, even using a journalist's Jewish faith to call him into question. Labour hasn't changed,\" she said.Badenoch also called for the PM to \"tell us immediately if he will now end Labour Together's links with his Government and return the tainted money they've donated\".Labour has been approached for comment.

    "body": "UK planes 'in the sky' in Middle East as part of defensive operation, PM says58 minutes agoAleks PhillipsandFiona NimoniGetty ImagesBritish planes \"are in the sky\" in the Middle East as part of a defensive operation \"to protect our people, our interests and our allies\", the prime minister has said.In a pre-recorded statement on Saturday, Sir Keir Starmer said protections for British bases and personnel had been stepped up to their highest level.The US and Israel launched strikes across multiple Iranian cities including capital Tehran on Saturday morning, after negotiations to limit Iran's nuclear programme ended without a deal. The UK did not participate in the strikes.Earlier, the PM released a joint statement with the leaders of France and Germany, calling for Iran to \"refrain from indiscriminate military strikes\".In his speech, Sir Keir said he wanted to see \"peace and security\" in the Middle East and the \"protection of civilian life\". He added: \"Iran can end this now. \"They should refrain from further strikes, give up their weapons programme and cease the appalling violence and oppression of the Iranian people – who deserve the right to determine their own future.\"The prime minister condemned Iran's retaliatory attacks \"on partners across the region\" after explosions were heard in several Middle East countries with US facilities.He said many countries attacked by Iran \"are not parties to this conflict\" and called Iran's strikes \"indiscriminate\". \"Even in the United Kingdom, the Iranian regime poses a direct threat to dissidents and to the Jewish community\", Sir Keir added. \"Over the last year alone, they have backed more than 20 potentially lethal attacks on UK soil.\"So it is clear they must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\"Earlier, Sir Keir, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged Iran to \"refrain from its destabilising activity in the region and our homelands, and to cease the appalling violence and repression against its own people\".\"We urge the Iranian leadership to seek a negotiated solution. Ultimately, the Iranian people must be allowed to determine their future,\" the three leaders added. Iran's Supreme National Security Council has promised a \"crushing\" response to the US-Israeli attacks.The situation in the Middle East has caused major disruption to air travel and security in the region, with hundreds of thousands of Britons potentially affected. Four people were injured after an \"incident\" at a building in the Palm Jumeirah area of Dubai, authorities there said, as eyewitness images and footage showed a plume of smoke near the Fairmont The Palm hotel. Iranian state media reported that an attack had been launched on Dubai but did not say what it targeted. The US military has a base and personnel in the UAE. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper condemned the Iranian strikes and described the scenes at the Palm Hotel as \"awful\", adding she had spoken to her Emirati counterpart \"to express our solidarity with the UAE\".The Foreign Office (FCDO) has updated its travel advice to warn \"against all travel to Israel and Palestine\".British people in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates have been told by the UK Foreign Office to immediately shelter in place, while those in Saudi Arabia have been told to \"remain indoors in a secure location\". UK nationals in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, and Oman have also been instructed to \"remain vigilant\" and take shelter if advised to do so.Explosions and air raid sirens were heard in Qatar's capital, Doha, which is host to a US military facility. Qatar's defence ministry said it had intercepted Iranian missiles.Bahraini state news also reported the service centre of the US Navy's 5th Fleet based in the Gulf nation had been \"subjected to a missile attack\".Sir Keir spoke with the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in separate phone calls on Saturday, Downing Street said. The PM thanked the UAE's president for his efforts to keep British nationals in the country safe, and reaffirmed \"the UK's commitment to the defence of Qatar\".A Cobra meeting about the US and Israeli strikes was held on Saturday morning, chaired by Sir Keir. The emergency committee, which involves ministers and officials, meets to co-ordinate the government's response to an emerging situation.\"Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that is why we have continually supported efforts to reach a negotiated solution,\" a government spokesperson said.\"Our immediate priority is the safety of UK nationals in the region and we will provide them with consular assistance.\"They added: \"We do not want to see further escalation into a wider regional conflict.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she stood with the US and Israel \"as they take on the threat of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its vile regime\".Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he prayed \"for the right outcome for the wonderful Persian people\" as \"attacks against this evil regime in Iran begin\".Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Iranians \"deserve to live free from a brutal regime\", but Trump's \"unilateral and illegal military action won't deliver freedom, peace and security\".The UK \"can't be dragged into another protracted Middle Eastern war by a US president\", he added.Referencing reports that a strike had hit a girls' school and killed dozens, Green Party leader Zack Polanski said: \"This is an illegal, unprovoked and brutal attack that shows once again that the USA and Israel are rogue states.\"The UK must end our cosy relationship with the USA and our ongoing support for Israel.\"Additional reporting by Matt Cole and Marc Ashdown",

    "body": "30 minutes agoAnnabel RackhamCulture reporterGetty ImagesHarry Styles, who is one of the most hotly anticipated performers of the evening, walked the Brits red carpet on Saturday eveningThe Brits Awards red carpet was as vibrant as ever, with some amazing musical talent making an appearance for the UK's biggest night in music.This time, though, and for the first time in its 50-year history, the Brits swapped London for Manchester's Co-op Live Arena. But one thing remained the same and that was the fashion on display - with catwalk ready looks from the likes of Olivia Dean, Rosalía and Harry Styles.It was a big night for co-ordination, with Wet Leg and Wolf Alice making sure they matched perfectly, as did Kelly and Sharon Osbourne.Getty ImagesOlivia Dean is the woman of the moment - not only is she performing at tonight's show, but she is nominated in some of the biggest categories, including album and song of the year.Her yellow, floor-length gown was in keeping with her classic sophisticated and elegant red carpet style.Getty ImagesMaya Jama joked on social media over the weekend about the coincidence of the Brits moving to Manchester when she did - to be with her boyfriend, Manchester City star Rúben Dias - so she will certainly enjoy the short journey home after a big night out.She looked perfectly angelic in an all-white glittery dress, complete with a flowing fur shawl.Getty ImagesHarry Styles is the man of the moment - not only is it three years since he last performed at the Brits, but he's a week away from releasing his fourth studio album Kiss All The Time, Disco Occasionally.He wore a disco-approved pinstripe suit on the red carpet on Saturday evening.Getty ImagesIt will be hard for anyone to top JADE's iconic performance at last year's Brits, in which she sang her song Angel Of My Dreams in - you guessed it - gigantic angel wings.And she looked just as ethereal tonight on the red carpet in an incredibly voluminous peplum-skirted dress.Getty ImagesNigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who sings on Dave's hit Raindance, was in attendance on the red carpet in a beautiful white outfit that could easily double as a wedding dress.Getty ImagesKelly and Sharon Osbourne were in attendance on the red carpet in co-ordinated black outfits.They are in attendance at tonight's Brits to honour their late father and husband Ozzy Osbourne, who will be remembered in a special segment at tonight's awards.Getty ImagesLola Young is up for song and artist of the year at tonight's awards and will be hoping to take home one of the top prizes.She looked effortlessly cool on the red carpet in a green leather peplum top and snake print trousers.Getty ImagesJeff Goldblum was a surprise addition at the Brits - he told the BBC his fifth album is coming out soon with his jazz band The Mildred Snitzer Orchestra and that he can't wait to tour it round the UK.Getty ImagesKwn, who is nominated for best R&B act, told our team on the Brits red carpet that her outfit was straight from Nigeria - paying tribute to her father's heritage.Getty ImagesGetty ImagesWe love when bands get the colour co-ordinating memo and tonight was no exception - Wet Leg (top) and Wolf Alice (bottom) looked formidably cool in their complimenting clobber.Both bands are also battling it out tonight in both the group of the year and alternative/rock act categories. Getty ImagesCMAT is nominated for International artist of the year and celebrated the success of her album Euro-Country, which is partly recorded in Gaelic. She wore a tartan outfit with powerful shoulder pads and a full skirt.Getty ImagesRosalía is up for international artist of the year after releasing her fourth studio album Lux last year and celebrated with an incredible feather dress by Chanel.ReutersScottish singer-songwriter Jacob Alon arrived as a winner already, having joined the ranks of Adele and Sam Fender in winning the pre-announced Critics' Choice award.PAShaun Ryder (right) and Mark \"Bez\" Berry from the influential Madchester band the Happy Mondays looked the part as they, ahem, stepped on to the red carpet.Additional reporting by Paul Glynn.",

    "body": "What we know so far: Supreme Leader's compound hit and Iran's retaliatory strikes10 minutes agoHafsa KhalilandDavid GrittenAirbus DS 2026Satellite image showing damage to the compound of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in TehranThe US and Israel have launched a large-scale attack on Iran.President Donald Trump said the US had begun \"major combat operations\" and urged Iranians to overthrow their clerical rulers once they were complete.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the compound of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had been destroyed in \"a powerful, surprise strike\" and that there were many signs that he was \"gone\".Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said earlier that Khamenei was alive \"as far as I know\". He also denounced the strikes as \"wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate\".Iran responded to the attack by launching missiles towards Israel and four Gulf Arab countries which host US military bases: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE.Videos shared online show aftermath of strikesShortly after 09:30 local time (06:00 GMT) on Saturday, Iranian media reported explosions in the capital, Tehran. Pictures showed smoke over the city's Jomhouri Square and Hassan Abad Square.Explosions were also reportedly heard in several other cities across the country, including Karaj, near Tehran, Isfahan and Qom in the centre of the country, and Kermanshah in the west.Videos circulating on social media showed people running in panic near sites of explosions. The sound of screams and crying could be heard in the background.Footage from Tehran verified by the BBC showed explosions within 1km (0.6 miles) of Leadership House, the compound of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has ultimate power in Iran.Satellite imagery obtained by the BBC also showed signs of significant damage in the compound, including blackened buildings, debris and a column of smoke.It was not immediately clear whether Khamenei was there at the time of the strikes.When asked about the supreme leader's health on Saturday afternoon, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei told the BBC he was \"not in a situation to confirm anything\".The office of President Masoud Pezeshkian in the capital was also reportedly targeted. Iranian state TV said President Masoud Pezeshkian was \"safe\" and he later put out a statement.An Israeli military official later briefed journalists that Israeli and US forces had targeted three gatherings of Iranian officials, and that several senior figures had been eliminated.Despite a near-total internet blackout that monitors detected late on Saturday morning, several further waves of strikes and explosions were reported throughout Saturday.Iran's state news agency, Irna, said there were explosions in Tehran, Karaq and Qom, as well as the western provinces of Lorestan, Hamadan, Kermanshah and Ilam; Tabriz in the north west; and parts of the southern Gulf province of Hormozgan, including Qeshm Island.There were also reports of blasts in the western city of Dezful; the outskirts of Shiraz and Kerman in the south; Kordestan and West Azerbaijan in the north-west; the central province of Markazi; Qazvin and Zanjan in the north, and Sistan Baluchestan in the south-east.On Saturday evening, a spokesman for the Iranian Red Crescent told local media 24 of Iran's 31 provinces had been hit in US and Israeli strikes.He also said a total of 201 people had been killed and 747 others injured across the country as of 20:45 (17:15 GMT), without providing a regional breakdown.State media said at least 85 people had been killed in an Israeli strike on a primary school for girls in Minab, Hormozgan province. The BBC has not been able to verify the reports.Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation has said the country's airspace is closed until further notice.What have the US and Israel said? The first statement on Saturday morning came from Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz, who said his country had \"launched a pre-emptive strike against Iran to remove threats\" and warned Israelis to prepare for retaliatory missile and drone attacks.Just over an hour later, Trump posted a video on Truth Social confirming US involvement in the strikes and saying the objective was \"to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime\".\"We're going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We're going to annihilate their navy. We're going to ensure that the region's terrorist proxies can no longer destabilise the region or the world and attack our forces,\" he added.\"And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon.\"It came after weeks of threats from Trump that he would order military action if Iran did not agree a new deal over its nuclear programme.Iran has said repeatedly that its nuclear activities are entirely peaceful and that it does not seek to obtain nuclear weapons.Trump also told members of Iran's armed forces could either lay down their weapons and be given \"complete immunity\", or \"face certain death\".He also urged Iranian civilians to stay in their homes and prepare to overthrow the clerical establishment.\"When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.\"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel and the US had \"operation to remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran\".Thanking Trump, he reiterated his message that Iran \"must not be allowed to arm itself with nuclear weapons that would enable it to threaten all of humanity\".And he similarly said the strikes would \"create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands\".\"The time has come for all segments of the people in Iran... to rid themselves of the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peace-seeking Iran.\"Later, Netanyahu announced that the initial strikes had \"eliminated senior officials in the ayatollahs' regime, Revolutionary Guards commanders, senior figures in the nuclear programme\".The US military's Central Command said in a statement on Saturday evening that US and Israeli forces had begun striking targets to \"dismantle the Iranian regime's security apparatus, prioritising locations that posed an imminent threat\". They reportedly included command-and-control facilities, air defence capabilities, missile and drone launch sites, and military airfields.The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) meanwhile announced that about 200 fighter jets had taken part in what it called an \"extensive attack against the missile array and the defence systems\" in western and central Iran.The jets simultaneously dropped hundreds of munitions on about 500 targets, including aerial defence systems and missile launchers, and severely degraded Iran's offensive capabilities, it added.The IDF's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, said the Israeli and US political and military leadership had undertaken a \"deep and comprehensive joint operational planning process\" for Saturday's attacks since the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last June, during which the US carried out strikes on three key Iranian nuclear facilities.How has Iran responded?Iran's foreign minister accused Israel and the US of launching a war that was \"wholly unprovoked, illegal, and illegitimate\".\"Our powerful armed forces are prepared for this day and will teach the aggressors the lesson they deserve,\" Araghchi wrote on X.The Iranian defence ministry also vowed to deliver a \"crushing and regret-inducing\" to what it called the \"savage attack\" by Israel and the US.The semi-official Tasnim news agency cited the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) as saying its forces had responded to the strikes by striking multiple sites in Israel as well as five major US military facilities in the region - Al Udeid airbase in Qatar, Al Dhafra airbase in the United Arab Emirates, the US Fifth Fleet headquarters in Bahrain, Ali Al Salem airbase in Kuwait, and Muwaffaq Salti airbase in Jordan.The IRGC also said its naval forces a US combat support vessel had come under \"severe blows\" from missiles, and that a US FP-132 radar system in Qatar had been \"completely destroyed\", according to the report.The European Union's naval mission in the region, EUNAVFOR ASPIDES, meanwhile said that the IRGC had sent radio messages to vessels warning that \"no ship is allowed to pass the Strait of Hormuz\" in the Gulf, through which about 20% of global oil and gas shipments pass.US Central Command said that its forces had \"successfully defended against hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks\" on Saturday.It added that no US casualties or combat-related injuries had been reported and that damage to US installations in the region was \"minimal and has not impacted operations\".In Israel, Israeli media reported that Iran launched about 150 ballistic missiles towards Israel, mostly in small salvos, as well as dozens of attack drones.Air defence systems intercepted a number of the missiles, while others struck open areas, they added.The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it treated a teenager for shrapnel-related injuries in central Israel, and that a man was injured by a blast shockwave in the north. A second person in the north was injured after falling from a height in the wake of a missile impact, it added.The UAE's defence ministry said its air defence systems dealt with a \"blatant attack involving Iranian ballistic missiles\" and intercepted a number of them.However, a Pakistani civilian was killed by falling debris in the city of Abu Dhabi, local authorities said. Another four people were injured at the landmark Palm development in Dubai.Kuwait's defence ministry said three Kuwaiti soldiers were injured by shrapnel when Ali Al Salem airbase, which houses US personnel, was targeted by Iranian missiles and drones.A drone also struck Kuwait's international airport, causing minor injuries and some material damage.Bahrain's interior ministry said three residential buildings in Manama and Muharraq were damaged by drone attacks and falling debris from an intercepted missile.The Bahraini government also reported that the service centre of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet was subjected to a missile attack.Qatar said its armed forces had intercepted several waves of missiles launched towards the country. A number of explosions were heard in the capital, Doha.Is it safe to travel to the region?Major airlines have diverted or cancelled flights to the Middle East, citing safety, and have apologised to customers.Wizz Air has suspended flights until 7 March in Israel, Dubai and Abu Dhabi and Amman in Jordan, and in Saudi Arabia until Tuesday.British Airways has cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until Wednesday, while Saturday's service to Amman is grounded.Kuwait's aviation authority said it was halting all flights to Iran until further notice, according to state media.Emirates has temporarily suspended its operations to and from Dubai. Lufthansa, Air India, Virgin Atlantic and Turkish Airlines have also announced cancellations.Some countries in the region - including Iraq and Jordan - have also closed their airspace. The UAE said it has \"partially and temporarily\" closed its airspace as a precaution, state media reported.Meanwhile, the UK Foreign Office travel guidance for Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman, is now advising travellers to \"remain vigilant, follow local authority advice and take shelter if advised\".",

China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with self-governing Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force.  \nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US wouldn’t abandon the island in exchange for a favourable deal with China. But a tug of war has been playing out inside the Trump administration over whether a military battle for Taiwan – if China did try to seize it – would be in America’s best interests.  \nWe speak to writer and analyst James Crabtree about what to expect from Trump’s visit to Asia and where Taiwan goes from here. \nProducers: Viv Jones and Xandra Ellin \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nMix: Travis Evans \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nImage: Taiwanese people observe the changing of honor guards in Liberty Square in Taipei.

    "body": "An independent investigation has been launched after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison in what appears be \"human error\", Justice Secretary David Lammy has said.In a statement to the House of Commons, Lammy said the inquiry will seek to \"fully establish the facts\" of the release of Hadush Kebatu and whether the staff involved had \"sufficient experience, training and technology\".Kebatu, who was set to be deported, was freed in error from HMP Chelmsford on Friday, prompting a 48-hour manhunt that ended with him being re-arrested in north London on Sunday.Responding to Lammy's statement, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick described the release of Kebatu as a \"national embarrassment.\"Lammy said Kebatu would be deported back to Ethiopia \"as quickly as possible\".Earlier on Monday, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested the deportation would happen within a few days.Kebatu was sentenced last month for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in July in Epping, Essex, where he had been living in an asylum hotel since arriving in the UK on a small boat. His arrest triggered a series of protests in the area, which spread to hotels housing asylum seekers across the country.Kebatu was due to be taken to an immigration detention centre to be deported under an early removals scheme (ERS) for foreign national offenders but was instead released in \"what appears to have been in human error\", Lammy told MPs.\"I've been clear from the outset that a mistake of this nature is unacceptable,\" he told MPs.\"We must get to the bottom of what happened and take immediate action to try and prevent similar releases in error to protect the public from harm.\"Lammy said the independent investigation will be chaired by former Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Dame Lynne Owens. Dame Lynne will also talk to the victims of Kebatu to \"understand the effect this incident had on them,\" Lammy said. \"Her report will highlight points of failure and make recommendations to help prevent further releases in error, which have been rising year-on-year since 2021 - going from nine per month on average in 2023 to 17 per month in the period spanning January to June 2024,\" he added. \"And I'm clear that a single release in error is one too many, which is why we have launched this independent investigation.\"A prison officer has been suspended while the probe takes place.The government has ordered prison governors to carry out new procedures to avoid a repeat of Kebatu's mistaken release.Lammy said he had ordered an \"urgent review\" into the checks that take place when someone is released from prison. New safeguards have been added that amount to the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place,\" he told MPs.Foreign criminals facing deportation will only be able to be released from prison when a duty governor is physically present, Lammy, who is also deputy prime minister, said.The Prison Governors' Association said the additional checks were \"undoubtedly\" the result of the need to do something after an apparent failure of procedures, but whether they will address the issues \"we will not know until the issues have been identified\".No removals from HMP Chelmsford under the ERS will take place this week.The number of prisoners who have been released mistakenly has risen sharply, with 262 let out in error between April 2024 and March 2025, up from 115 over the same period a year earlier.Lammy suggested the mistaken release of Kebatu was a \"symptom\" of the prison system Labour inherited from the previous Conservative government.There had been a 30% cut in prison staffing, and more than half of frontline prison officers now have less than five years' experience, Lammy said. \"It's little wonder when the system has been brought to its knees that errors like this happen,\" he added.In response, Jenrick said the mistaken release was \"a national embarrassment and today the justice secretary feigns anger at what happened.\"He called on Lammy to give his \"cast iron assurance\" that Kebatu will be deported from the country by the end of the week.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKing Charles was heckled by a protester asking him about Prince Andrew's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during a visit to a cathedral on Monday.The man asked how long the King had known about his brother and Epstein, and questioned whether he had asked the police to \"cover up\" for Andrew.His protest was met by vocal support for the King, including one woman who told him to \"shut up\". There were also loud chants of \"three cheers for the King\".Prince Andrew's links with Epstein have been under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. The prince, who relinquished his titles earlier this month, has strongly denied any wrongdoing.Throngs of fans had waited to meet the King, who was visiting Staffordshire for an engagement at Lichfield Cathedral.In video footage from the event, the single protester said: \"How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein? Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?\"Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?\"The King did not respond to the questions but carried on greeting fans, some of whom chanted \"God Save The King\". One fan can be heard asking him for a hug.Several people outside the cathedral looked visibly annoyed by the protester, with a woman telling him to \"go away and leave him alone\".The scandal over Prince Andrew's connections to Epstein has been reignited by sexual abuse allegations repeated in Virginia Giuffre's posthumously published memoir.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she had sex with the prince on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and \"eight other young girls\".Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. In 2019, he told BBC Newsnight he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\" and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact\".Recently, fresh questions have been asked about how he is able to fund his lifestyle despite not being a working royal.The revelation that he has only ever paid a token annual rent on his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, has intensified the scrutiny over his living arrangements - even though he made large payments up front, including for renovations.The Liberal Democrats said he should be called in front of MPs to give evidence about his lease of his lodge.But last Thursday, the government refused to give MPs time to debate the prince's titles or his home, despite growing pressure for scrutiny.Buckingham Palace has not commented on whether Prince Andrew might move out of his home - or where he might go.",

    "body": "Singer Katy Perry and former Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau appear to have confirmed their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris. Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau is seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for weeks with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau  was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday over the weekend and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Representatives for Perry and Trudeau's Liberal party did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.  After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

    "body": "The UK has secured a deal worth up to £8bn to supply Turkey with 20 Typhoon fighter jets. During a visit to Ankara to sign the agreement on Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described it as \"a win for British workers, a win for our defence industry and a win for Nato security\".It is the largest fighter jet export deal in almost two decades and will support thousands of jobs across the UK for years to come, the government said.Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hailed the agreement as \"a new symbol of the strategic relations\" with Britain.Announcing the agreement at a press conference in the Turkish capital, Sir Keir called it \"a landmark moment\".The provision of 20 Typhoon fighter jets will \"bolster security across Nato, deepen our bilateral defence cooperation and boost economic growth\" in both the UK and Turkey, he said.\"I'm proud that British Typhoons will form a vital part of the Turkish airforce for many years to come, as you defend Nato's south-eastern flank for the good of all of us,\" he added.The Eurofighter jets are jointly produced by Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, and the deal was subject to approval from the other members of the consortium.About 37% of each jet's production takes place in the UK, including final assembly at BAE Systems plants in Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire.The government said the deal would support 6,000 jobs at the two BAE plants, 1,100 in south-west England, including at the Rolls-Royce plant in Bristol, and 800 in Scotland.It is the first new order of UK Typhoons since 2017.Describing the agreement as the \"biggest jets export deal in a generation\", defence secretary John Healey said it would \"pump billions of pounds into our economy and keep British Typhoon production lines turning long into the future\".Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems chief executive, said the procurement \"marks the start of a new chapter in our longstanding relationship with this important Nato ally\" and underscores how \"investment in defence can fuel significant economic growth and returns across the UK\".The deal is the culmination of long-running negotiations, with Britain and Turkey signing a preliminary purchase deal for 40 Typhoons in July.On Monday, Sir Keir said 20 would be supplied to Turkey \"with the option to provide more in the future\".The delivery of the first jets is expected in 2030.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterNigel Farage has said Reform MP Sarah Pochin did not intend to be racist when she complained about adverts being \"full\" of black and Asian people.The Reform UK leader said the way she worded her comments was \"wrong and ugly\" but they were made \"in a broader context of DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] madness in the advertising industry\".Pochin has apologised for her remarks, saying they were \"phrased poorly\" but maintained that many adverts were \"unrepresentative of British society\".It comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer branded the comments racist, with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats calling for Farage to suspend her from the parliamentary party.Asked during a press conference on grooming gangs if he accepted Pochin's comments were racist, Farage said: \"I am unhappy with what she has done...\"I understand the basic point but the way she put it, the way she worded it, was wrong and was ugly.\"And if I thought that the intention behind it was racist then I would have taken a lot more action than I have to date.\"Earlier Sir Keir said Pochin's comments were \"shocking racism\" and \"the sort of thing that'll tear our country apart\".\"Nigel Farage has some questions to answer. Because either he doesn't consider it racist, which in my view is shocking in itself, or he does think it's racist and he's shown absolutely no leadership,\" he told BBC North West Tonight.Labour chairwoman Anna Turley has written to Farage to ask if he endorses Pochin's comments and whether he will withdraw the Reform UK whip from her - meaning she would sit as an independent MP.With Labour trailing Reform UK in the polls, Sir Keir has stepped up his attacks on the party in recent weeks.This is the second time he has accused the party of racism, after using the label to describe Reform's immigration policy last month.Pochin was speaking during a TalkTV phone-in on Saturday, when she said she agreed with a caller who complained about the \"demographics\" of advertising.The Runcorn and Helsby MP said the viewer was \"absolutely right\" and \"it drives me mad when I see adverts full of black people, full of Asian people\".She said that it did not reflect society and \"your average white person\" is \"not represented anymore\".In a social media post later on Saturday, Pochin said her comments \"were phrased poorly and I unreservedly apologise for any offence caused, which was not my intention\".\"The point I was making is that many British TV adverts have gone DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] mad and are now unrepresentative of British society as a whole,\" she said.She cited a Channel 4 study which found that the proportion of adverts featuring black people jumped after the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, from 37% in 2020 to 51% in 2022.\"Representation should reflect the diversity of modern Britain, but it should also be proportionate and inclusive of everyone,\" she added.The Liberal Democrats have also called on Farage to suspend Pochin from the party, while urging the government and the Conservatives to back a parliamentary motion rebuking the MP for her \"racist and inexcusable remarks\". The party's home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson said: \"Sarah Pochin's remarks were blatantly racist. \"Decent MPs from across party lines should now come together to condemn this disgraceful behaviour and show the public that this will never be tolerated by Parliament.\"He also accused Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp of being \"spineless\" for \"failing to immediately call out Pochin's racist remarks for what they were\".Asked about her comments on Sunday, Philp told the BBC: \"It's certainly not language that I would use and I don't think politicians should speak in those terms.\"He later told LBC the way Ms Pochin made her comments was \"racist\", adding: \"She should absolutely not have said that. It was completely wrong.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseUS President Donald Trump has not ruled out the possibility of seeking a third term for the White House, saying he would \"love to do it\". But Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice-president in 2028 - an idea floated by some supporters as a way for him to circumvent the US constitution that bars the president from running for a third term.Speaking to reporters during his trip to Asia, Trump described the idea as \"too cute\" and said it \"wouldn't be right\". It is unclear what method he would use to run again. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon said that a \"plan\" was in place to secure the 79-year-old president another term. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Japan from Malaysia, Trump said that while he would \"be allowed\" to run again as vice-president, he had no plans to do so.\"I think people wouldn't like that,\" he said. \"It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.\" Talking about the possibility of a third term, Trump said: \"I haven't really thought about it. But I have the best poll numbers that I've ever had.\" Additionally, Trump also suggested vice-president JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors, calling them \"unstoppable\".\"All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't,\" he added, referrring to Democrats.Can Trump serve a third term as US president?The 22nd amendment of the US constitution bars presidents from seeking a third term. Repealing the amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a constitutional convention called by  two-thirds of state legislatures - a process viewed as highly unlikely.Last week, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon - who remains a vocal supporter - claimed there was a \"plan\" to secure a third term for Trump.\"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told  The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again, though he later said  he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. It is still unclear which Democrats intend to run for the White House in 2028, although several have already expressed an interest. On Sunday, California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that  he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not giving serious thought to a presidential bid. Former vice-president Kamala Harris also told the BBC she may run again and that she could \"possibly\" be president in the future. ",

    "body": "British journalist and media commentator Sami Hamdi, an outspoken critic of Israel, has been arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). While on a speaking tour of the US over the weekend, Hamdi was detained by ICE officers and his visa was revoked, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Tricia McLaughlin, announced on X on Sunday. Hamdi is in ICE custody pending his removal from the country, she added.The State Department and DHS allege that Hamdi supports terrorism and poses a threat to national security, while a Muslim advocacy group argues he is being politically targeted in violation of his free speech rights.\"We've said it before, we'll say it again: The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans,\" the State Department said on X in a post about Hamdi's detainment. The department added that it will continue revoking the visas of people engaged in such activities. Hamdi, who frequently appears on British TV networks to comment on the Middle East, was detained at San Francisco International Airport on Sunday \"apparently because of his criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza\", the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, said in a statement. Hamdi spoke at CAIR Sacramento's annual gala on Saturday, and was scheduled to speak at CAIR Florida's gala on Sunday before he was detained.\"Our nation must stop abducting critics of the Israeli government at the behest of unhinged Israel First bigots. This is an Israel First policy, not an America First policy, and it must end,\" CAIR wrote in its statement. CAIR urged ICE to immediately release Hamdi, adding that its lawyers are working to address the \"injustice\". Hamdi's arrest came after far-right political activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer wrote a series of posts on X accusing Hamdi of supporting terrorist organisations. In return, CAIR argued Loomer was promoting \"anti-Muslim conspiracy theories\".Representatives for Hamdi did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. This isn't the first time the Trump administration has revoked the visas of people who have openly criticised Israel's war in Gaza. In March, Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil was arrested and threatened with deportation in a case that is still ongoing. His case was the most prominent in a series of arrests of student activists. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoMichale Shuval,BBC Arabic, Jerusalem and Jaroslav LukivThe father of a released Israeli hostage who was forced to dig his own grave in a Gazan tunnel by Hamas has told the BBC his son's health is \"improving every day\".Avishai David was speaking after his 24-year-old son Evyatar David and two other freed hostages - Guy Gilboa Dalal and Eitan Mor - were discharged from hospital to a hero's welcome at their homes on Sunday.\"I can't explain how happy it makes me feel to see him growing back to his old self,\" the father added.In August, two months before Evyatar's release, Hamas had posted a video showing him emaciated in a narrow concrete tunnel - a move that drew condemnation from Israel and many Western leaders.Avishai David told the BBC he was happy to see his son's \"vitality improving every day, his colour returning [to his face], his cheeks getting fuller\".\"Thank God, he pulled through it and he's strong.\"The father said he had suffered for months knowing that his son was only \"80km away... and I can't help him\".\"It devastated me,\" he said, adding that he \"couldn't sleep, eat, drink properly.\"In August, Evyatar's brother Ilay told the BBC the Hamas video was a \"new form of cruelty\".\"He's a human skeleton. He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal,\" Ilay said at the time.In the footage itself, Evyatar said: \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water.\" He was seen digging what he said would be his own grave.On Sunday, cheering crowds - including many friends and neighbours - greeted Evyatar David as he returned to his hometown of Kfar Saba in central Israel. Dr Michal Shteinman, director at Rabin Medical Centre where the three released hostages were treated, told the BBC their bodies still bore the marks of \"this horrific captivity\".\"We can see their blood tests... and we've also heard their stories... they are not lying. You can see the marks of this metabolic trauma. Their skin tells their story. You can see the scars and the wounds.\"But Dr Shteinman added that the hostages \"came back stronger than they were\".Evyatar was abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.He and 19 other living hostages have been released by Hamas under the first phase of a US-brokered ceasefire deal earlier this month.Hamas has also transferred 15 out of 28 deceased hostages. Thirteen were Israelis, one was Nepalese and the other Thai.In exchange, Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, and returned 15 bodies of Palestinians for every Israeli hostage's remains.The IDF launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.More than 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

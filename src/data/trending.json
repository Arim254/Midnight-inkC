    "body": "Why are there so few South Asian footballers at the top?1 hour agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi de Souza,BBC Newsbeat PFAThe Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme is run by the Professional Footballers' AssociationThe number of South Asian men playing professional football in England has almost doubled since the 2021-22 season, when the Football Association (FA) launched a strategy to boost participation in the game.But the numbers don't tell the whole story.While there were 28 professional South Asian players in England last season - compared with 16 five years ago - they represent just over 1% of those competing at an elite level.But the interest is there - the FA reports that within England more South Asian people are playing, coaching and refereeing across all levels of the game.Within South Asian communities, more than 11% of adult males and more than 15% of adult females are participating in football, it says.There is no shortage of talent - but why are so few players struggling to break through to the top?Players tells BBC Newsbeat tired myths, cultural expectations and lack of infrastructure are some of the reasons why.'We've experienced this for decades'Natine WilliamsMarva Kreel is a footballer presenter and played for Tottenham as a child\"It's good more conversations are happening, but it's something that a lot of us have been experiencing for decades,\" says journalist and presenter Marva Kreel.Marva, who is of part South-Asian heritage, has been involved in girls' and women's football since childhood and once played for Tottenham as a youth. \"When I looked around, the players that were playing on the pitch didn't represent my local area,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"They didn't represent who I was going to school with, it was a very white space.\"Marva says physical barriers, such as distant training grounds, stopped some of her friends from progressing to higher levels. \"You couldn't get to training. You couldn't get to your games in the same way that boys could and that my boy mates could, because we didn't have coaches laid on for us,\" she says.Marva says certain assumptions can count out promising South Asian talent. \"A lot of this comes down to shared problems that we have in the South Asian community of how South Asian boys and how South Asian girls might be stereotyped amongst football,\" she says.'Told we would never make it'Professional Footballers' AssociationRiz Rehman runs a programme which helps mentor South Asian footballing talentIt's a situation Riz Rehman experienced himself.\"We were told that we would never make it because you've got the wrong diet, you're playing towards education, not sport,\" he recalls.Riz's brother, Zesh, was the first British South Asian to play in the Premier League.He had hopes of forging a similar career but had to stop playing due to injury.Now a coach, he worked with the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) to set up the Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme (AIMS), which supports Asian footballers at all levels by setting them up with mentors putting on workshops.\"AIMS will give support to any player on the elite pathway,\" says the 43-year-old, referring to the phases aspiring pros must go through.Riz says he wants to give others the chances and understanding that he and his brother missed out on.\"We obviously defeated those odds and we wanted to give every single player on the elite pathway a helping hand so that it is possible they can make it in the game as well,\" he says. The FA says Loughborough University is carrying out an independent evaluation of AIMS to help it understand the programme's impact and shape its future.'Mentoring has massive impact'Getty ImagesMariam Mahmood currently plays for WrexhamMalvind Singh Benning, who plays for League Two side Shrewsbury Town, took part in the AIMS programme and is now a mentor.He recalls seeing only two players of South Asian heritage as he came up in his career.\"I'm 32 now so passing on real-life experience in the professional games to these young lads will be massive,\" he says. The PFA reports \"steady progress\" in getting more South Asian players into clubs but there is a way to go - particularly for women. Mariam Mahmood, who plays for Wrexham, says representation also hinges on role models.\"When people see other people's success stories and more publicity on people that are getting success in football, I think it will motivate other players and different people to also get involved and think: 'Oh, if they can do it, I can do it',\" says the 21-year-old.Mariam says she was \"lucky\" to cut her teeth in an inclusive academy but believes better representation starts at grassroots level, which feeds into the talent pool for bigger clubs. \"The important thing is to get [South Asians] playing football, develop them until they're 16, 17, so they can sign professional contracts and get into that pool of people.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "4 days agoJude WinterEast MidlandsMarcella KirkMarcella Kirk (left) and Helen Tait-Wright have completed the 8,000km (4,970-mile) Dakar RallyA pair of friends have become the first all-female British team to complete the Dakar Rally.Marcella Kirk, from West Handley in North East Derbyshire, and her friend Helen Tait-Wright, took part in the 8,000km (4,970-mile) race in Saudi Arabia.Tait-Wright said they had received sponsorship but also sold lots of their own possessions, including a car and their own jewellery, to raise £114,000 (€130,000) to build a specially-adapted Land Rover and for their expenses during the race.After finishing 83rd in the Dakar Classic section of the rally on Sunday, the pair said: \"We've done it and we're very proud of ourselves.\"The vehicle used during the challenge was a specially modified 1988 Land Rover Defender 110 built by Tait-Wright's husband Chris.It was driven by Tait-Wright, 56 and Kirk, 55, navigated the journey by map reading, as sat-navs were banned.The rally involved driving over a range of terrains from sand dunes, mud, rocks and dry river beds.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteThe vehicle used in the rally was a specially modified 1988 Land Rover Defender 110Kirk said they were unsure whether they would finish the rally after two tyres blew at the same time during the final section.\"We thought we'd keep the jeopardy going right to the end of the race, just to sort of keep everybody interested,\" Kirk joked.\"We only had one section to do, that's all we had to do really, get through it and we managed to blow two tyres at the same time.\"We hit one rock, bounced on to another, I got out and they were flat as pancakes.\"Kirk said a German team came along to help them get back on track, but they also ran into the same problem.\"I think they were going to stop and help us but they hit the same rock and blew a tyre too. So we were in a little convoy of blown tyres.\"It was actually a moment when I thought we're not going to make it to the finish,\" she said.Luckily, the Germans had large equipment so they could change the Land Rover's tyres and helped make sure Kirk and Tait-Wright were on the final stretch to the finish line.A.S.O./Aurélien VialatteKirk and Tait-Wright had to drive through a range of terrains, including sand dunes\"They helped us get back on our way, we set off but we still had 80 kilometres to do without any spares.\"The worry was then if we blew another tyre, that was it. That was our Dakar over,\" Kirk said.However, the pair managed to get to the end without further issues despite not having spare tyres and the \"steering being out\".\"A lot of people thought we wouldn't get here. \"It's been awesome, all the support has just been out of this world. \"All the messages kept us going and it gave us a big push to the end,\" said Kirk.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Every police officer in England and Wales will be required to hold a licence to be able to continue working, the Home Office has said. They will have to prove they have the right skills in issues such as tackling violence against women and girls or face being removed from their job, under the terms of a phased scheme similar to ones for lawyers or doctors. Under separate proposals announced on Friday, ministers will be granted new powers to dismiss chief constables and intervene in forces deemed to be failing. The plans are part of a raft of reforms expected from Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who is promising to oversee the biggest shake-up of policing in decades. Officers will have to renew what the Home Office calls a 'licence to practice' throughout their career by keeping up to date with latest methods and guidance. Training will be rolled out in phases. The aim is that the new standardised programme will be clearer to follow across all 43 police forces in England and Wales. \"Every police officer needs to remain match fit to protect their communities. As crime evolves, we expect police to evolve more quickly\", Crime and Policing Minister Sarah Jones said. \"The licence to practise will equip every officer with the skills and capabilities to do the job – whether new to the force or a policing veteran.\" Last week it was announced the home secretary will be given new powers to sack police chiefs. On Friday, additional statutory powers were extended to ministers, who will be able to force the \"retirement, resignation, or suspension\" of police chief constables if they are performing poorly. Currently, only police and crime commissioners hold that power. Ministers will also be able to send in \"specialist teams\" to turn around forces if crime solving rates or police response times are poor.The government said that new targets on policing will also be introduced, and made available to the public. \"It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces,\" Mahmood said in a statement. It comes after Mahmood last week said she had lost confidence in West Midlands Police's chief constable Craig Guildford after Israeli football fans were banned from a match against Aston Villa. He later retired from the force. Sir Andy Cooke, who leads His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS), welcomed the plans. The body independently assesses the effectiveness and efficiency of police forces. \"Where a police force is failing the public, there must be a clear, fair system to make sure concerns are acted upon. The inspectorate is a vital part of that system,\" he said. \"These reforms will help make sure under-performance is more quickly addressed whilst supporting forces to respond to our recommendations more effectively, so that every community gets the policing it deserves.\"On Monday, as part of her reforms plan, the home secretary will pledge to \"significantly\" cut the number of forces from its current level of 43, and tell them to focus on serious and organised crime.However, the Police Federation of England and Wales said: \"Policing's current structure has entrenched a postcode lottery in what the public see but also how officers are led, supported and treated.\"Fewer forces doesn't guarantee more or better policing for communities. Skills, capabilities and equipment need significant investment if the public and officers are going to see reform deliver in the real world.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "A new NHS database of genes linked to cancer could enable patients and their families in England to find out whether they are at risk of developing the disease.People will be able to have their genetic information compared to the world-first register of 120 genes known to increase the likelihood of getting cancer, NHS England has said.Those identified as having an inherited risk will be offered routine check-ups and screening for certain cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. Patients could also be tested to see whether they would respond better to particular treatments, allowing for personalised care.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"life-changing and life-saving\" tool would fast-track screening and allow more cancers to be caught sooner.Tens of thousands of cancer patients and those with a family history of the disease already undergo genetic testing on the NHS every year. Those known to have a higher risk profile will be added to the new register.They will be given tailored information about what they can do to lower their chance of developing cancer or detect it early.The NHS said it was building the register as part of a 10-year plan to improve prevention and treatment of cancer. NHS England's national cancer director told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was \"the first time any health care system has brought together all the information about all the genetic risk into a single place.\"Prof Peter Johnson said it pulled together the tests patients were already offered to check their cancer susceptibility into a single register, \"so that we can contact people to offer them screening and in some cases preventative treatment\".This will allow practitioners to \"keep tabs on people\" and offer them new tests and treatments as they are rolled out, he added, while stressing it would be \"incredibly confidential and secure\".Johnson said that while it could be \"very daunting\" for people to find out their cancer risk, it meant the disease could be picked up as early as possible.The NHS National Inherited Cancer Predisposition Register follows a similar database for Lynch syndrome which saw more than 12,000 people offered routine preventative screening after they were identified as being at higher risk, according to the NHS.Charlie Grinstead, a 32-year-old diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2020, said his Lynch syndrome diagnosis gave him access to immunotherapy after unsuccessful chemotherapy - and proved to be the \"the key to my recovery\".Streeting said: \"One in every two people will get cancer in their lifetime but that does not mean the chances are random - many people face a higher risk through the genes they inherit.\"And while we cannot do anything about inherited genes, we can do something about what we do with that information.\"He said the \"world-leading genetic register\" would allow personalised and preventative care to be provided sooner.\"This register won't just supercharge innovation - it will be life changing and life-saving, allowing the NHS to develop individual care, fast-track screening and tailored information to enable more cancers to be caught earlier.\"Claire Rowney, the chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said the move would \"transform the lives of women who are at increased risk of breast cancer due to their family history or genetics\".She said it had to be accessible to all clinicians and designed to ensure those with an increased risk profile received \"joined-up care\".",

Megan was warned by doctors that stress can increase the risk of stroke, which prompted her to take up baking.\"I started making little boxes [of food] for people, which went crazy, started making a little bit more, and it hasn't stopped,\" she said.While being unable to work, she came up with the idea as a way to potentially support her family if she cannot return to her job.Since then, hundreds of people have visited the shed. Megan said she was working round the clock to bake and had been surprised by the support.BBC/Jim ScottMegan Jackson has been supported by husband Liam with the project She said the venture was a needed distraction after suffering poor mental health following her diagnosis in March, last year.As well as severe headaches, medics noticed one pupil was larger than the other, prompting a brain scan which revealed a 5mm-wide aneurysm.It poses a risk of rupturing and she has been told that, because of its size, it is too risky to operate.Megan said she and her husband Liam had cried when she got the diagnosis and her first thought had been who would look after her toddler \"if I die\". She manages the condition through baking and daily prescription medications, but is often left with confusion and fatigue.Baking brings her \"total peace\" and she said she spent time in the kitchen \"cracking on\". \"It just feels I haven't got the worry of the stress of the aneurysm. I totally shut off and my mind is focused,\" she added. ",

    "body": "16 minutes agoKate Whannelpolitical reporterGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has until 17:00 GMT on Saturday to decide if he wants to stand in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election.Winning the parliamentary seat would enable Burnham to challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. However, there are several hurdles he must clear. First, as a directly-elected mayor, Burnham needs to get permission from Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) to put his name forward as a candidate. The BBC has been told that some of Sir Keir's allies on the committee will seek to block him from standing - a move that could anger Labour MPs supportive of Burnham.Burnham, a former Labour minister, has not confirmed whether he will apply to stand in the seat. Asked on Thursday about the vacancy in the Greater Manchester constituency, he said he was \"focused\" on his job as mayor and cautioned people not to \"rush to conclusions\".Deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell, who sits on the NEC, appeared to indicate her support for Burnham telling an audience in London that she wanted \"the very best candidate, the person who can most help Labour win in that by-election\" selected.She described Burnham as \"an incredibly popular politician\" and said he would have to \"make up his own mind\" about whether to stand. Powell, who represents a Manchester constituency, said Labour members should \"get behind Keir Starmer\" adding that she didn't want to see the by-election emerge into \"in-fighting and talking about ourselves\". There has been speculation that Sir Keir could face a leadership challenge after elections in May for the Welsh Parliament, Scottish Parliament and many local councils in England, which are expected to be difficult for Labour.Nearly 30 councils have opted to delay elections this year due to a major reorganisation of local government.Opposition MPs have criticised the delay, saying it would potentially disenfranchise millions of voters.In order to enter any leadership race, Burnham - who has run twice before to be Labour leader - would have to be an MP.He is expected to receive support from former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner, who the BBC understands will tell a Labour north west regional conference that the NEC should not block Burnham's application. Although Rayner resigned from government last year she still has strong support among some backbench MPs and members. Several Labour sources have said they believe the NEC will block Burnham's application to stand on the grounds that it would trigger an election for a new Manchester mayor, which would be expensive both for the party and the taxpayer. The last mayoral election cost the Greater Manchester Combined Authority around £4.7m. The NEC could also insist that there should be an all-women shortlist of possible Labour candidates for a by-election because the majority of the party's MPs are currently men.The decision will not be made by the full committee but the 10 NEC officers which include Sir Keir, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, deputy party leader  Powell and party chair Ellie Reeves. There are also representatives from the GMB and USDAW trade unions.The committee will tell Burnham what decision they have reached on Sunday. The final deadline for all applicants to apply to be Labour's candidate comes at midnight at the end of Sunday. The area of Gorton and Denton has long been a safe Labour seat, and was won at the last election with 18,000 votes. Reform UK came second with 5,000 votes, narrowly beating the Green Party into third place. Labour MPs are divided on whether they want Burnham to return to the House of Commons as an MP. In a post on X, Labour MP and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell said blocking Burnham would \"cause immense damage both to Keir and therefore the party\".Cat Smith, MP for Lancaster and Wyre, said: \"I think it would be disappointing if No 10 were to block strong candidates from being able to be considered by the party members in Gorton and Denton.\"Graham Stringer, the MP for Blackley and Middleton South, said \"As a sitting Manchester MP, I don't want to leave the back door open to Reform to have a go at getting the mayoralty of Greater Manchester.\"I think it's very high-risk. By-elections are a nightmare for any candidates standing on behalf of a sitting government. I don't think Andy should take that risk.\"",

    "body": "Pentagon to offer 'more limited' support to US allies in defence strategy shift4 hours agoClaire KeenanReutersHomeland security is the top priority in the Pentagon's new National Defense StrategyThe US will offer \"more limited\" support to allies, according to the Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy.In a significant shift to its security priorities, the US Department of Defense now considers security of the US homeland and Western Hemisphere - not China - as its primary concern.Previous versions of the strategy -  published every four years - named the threat posed by China as the top defence priority. Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".Late last year, the US announced a vast arms sale to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, carried out strikes against alleged drug boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to acquire Greenland. The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is \"not coming back\" and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. \"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". ",

    "body": "Ukraine has condemned a fresh wave of Russian strikes overnight which killed one person and injured 23 others, as talks with the US aimed at ending the war are set to resume.Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said the \"brutal\" attack - \"cynically\" ordered by Russian leader Vladimir Putin - had \"hit not only our people, but also the negotiation table\".Delegations from Russia, Ukraine and the US have been meeting in Abu Dhabi for the first trilateral talks since the Kremlin launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022.A source told the BBC that some progress had been made but the key issue of territory remains unresolved.The mayor of Ukrainian capital Kyiv said one person had died and four had been wounded while Kharkiv's mayor reported that 19 people had been hurt during a sustained assault on the city in the early hours of Saturday morning.On the second day of the three-way talks in Abu Dhabi, Sybiha said the \"barbaric\" overnight assault proved  \"that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal\".US President Donald Trump said last week that Putin had accepted an invitation to join his Board of Peace - an organisation focused on ending global conflicts. Putin has not confirmed this. Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that three of the four people who had been injured had been hospitalised.He added that the capital's critical infrastructure had been damaged, leaving 6,000 buildings without heating.Temperatures have fallen to around -12C in parts of Ukraine. In a statement following the assaults, President Volodymyr Zelensky said: \"The main target of the Russians was the energy infrastructure.\"Last week, Russia attacked Kyiv's power infrastructure, forcing Zelensky to initially call off his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  In Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said 19 people had been injured during the strikes in the early hours of Saturday morning. A maternity hospital and a hostel for displaced people were damaged.Russia occupies roughly 20% of Ukraine, including parts of the eastern Donbas region. The Kremlin wants Ukraine to hand over large areas of the territory, but Ukraine has ruled this out.In Davos, Zelensky said: \"It's all about the land. This is the issue which is not solved yet.\"He said that he had reached an agreement with Trump on future US security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a deal.He gave no detail but said it would need to go before US Congress and the Ukrainian parliament before signing.Global News Podcast: Can Ukraine get peace without losing land?The day before the talks in Abu Dhabi began, US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Putin in Moscow. After the four-hour meeting, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov said: \"Vladimir Putin has emphasised Russia's sincere commitment to settling the Ukraine crisis by political and diplomatic means.\"But he said \"bringing about a lasting settlement would be unlikely without addressing the territorial issue based on the formula as agreed in Anchorage\".Last August, Trump and Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska to discuss ending the war, resulting in an agreement to allow Russia to take the Donbas region and keep control of the Crimean peninsula, which it allegally annexed in 2014.Zelensky ruled out giving up the Donbas which is made up of Luhansk and Donetsk and has been partly occupied by Russia for 12 years.Following the first day of talks in Abu Dhabi, Rustem Umerov, who is leading the Ukrainian delegation, said on social media: \"The meeting focused on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process aimed at advancing toward a dignified and lasting peace.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorThe prime minister's condemnation of Donald Trump's remarks about the war in Afghanistan are his strongest public criticisms of the president yet.They come in a week where circumstances have led Sir Keir Starmer to conclude three times that it was necessary to publicly rebuke a man he has ploughed so much effort into building a strong relationship with.I am told Sir Keir, on returning to Downing Street on Friday afternoon, saw it as essential to make his views clear in the most direct terms.His tone and body language conveyed his anger, as did his words, in which he said what President Trump had said was \"insulting and frankly appalling\".The president had claimed that the Nato defence alliance, of which the UK is a member, had sent \"some troops\" to Afghanistan, but they \"stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"The comments, which are factually inaccurate, have been widely seen as crass and deeply offensive.Four hundred and fifty-seven British service personnel died in the conflict and many more suffered life changing injuries.The prime minister's team tell me Sir Keir sees standing up for and defending the armed forces as a first order duty of his role, as both those serving and those killed in conflict can't speak publicly for themselves.Incidentally, it is not the first time the Prime Minister has felt the need to stand up for the British military after remarks from the Trump administration.In March of last year, Sir Keir pointedly paid tribute to UK troops in the Commons after the US Vice-President JD Vance was accused of disrespecting them.But on that occasion, he made no reference to the vice-president by name.Sir Keir's response to the president is the third time in five days he has had to reach a quick judgement on how to calibrate a public response in defending what he sees as first principles under attack from the White House.The first came on Monday morning, with his case for the sanctity of the sovereignty of Greenland and a plea for \"calm discussion\".Within 24 hours, the president was lobbing around insults about the government's deal over the Chagos Islands.Little wonder, perhaps, that No 10 approached Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday with a sense that what he planned to say there wasn't without risk.His language and tone on the president's then ambitions for Greenland hardened, as he said the UK \"will not yield\" to pressure from Washington.While the prime minister's interventions on Monday and Wednesday were seen by officials through the prism of diplomacy and the reaction they might provoke, his remarks on Friday were approached with a different mindset. I'm told the judgement was more simple: it was categorically the right thing to do, the prime minister concluded, given the gravity of offence the president had caused.If Sir Keir manages a moment over the weekend to reflect on the last seven days, you have to wonder if he may judge it was a turning point in his relationship with President Trump.It is a relationship he prizes and cherishes. Plenty have praised him for pulling it off, others have criticised him for hugging a deeply controversial President too close.His argument has long been a close relationship is in the national interest.The question now is how typical weeks like the last one might become, if the president's penchant for what many see as outrage, insult and provocation becomes ingrained.",

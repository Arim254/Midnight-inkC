    "body": "Ariana Grande: Going brunette is not about saying goodbye to Glinda3 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter, Leicester Square, LondonPress AssociationAriana Grande has said her new darker hair is not about saying goodbye to her Wicked character Glinda, but rather a way of “doing something different”.The singer and actress, 32, has recently swapped her signature, Glinda-era blonde locks with a brunette tone, sending fans wild on social media.It comes as she resumes her role as the Good Witch of the North alongside Cynthia Erivo, who returns as Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, in Wicked: For Good.On Monday night, London’s Leicester Square was transformed into the magical Land of Oz, with Wicked-inspired shades of pink and green and a sprawling yellow brick road running through the middle.Fans came dressed in witches' hats and green makeup, while others channelled their inner Glinda in sparkly floor length gowns.Speaking to BBC News, Erivo, who was recently nominated for two Grammys, said it felt “overwhelming” to be closing the Wicked chapter.“It feels beautiful though,” said Grande. “This project will always be part of our lives.”The sequel picks up where the first film left off and covers the years after Elphaba and Glinda's decision to part ways.Elphaba is now an enemy of the state of Oz, while Glinda has become a public figure controlled by the Wizard.The sequel will see Grande and Erivo joined once again by co-stars Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Bailey and Jeff Goldblum as the Wizard.Bridgerton star Bailey, 37, who reprises his role of Prince Fiyero, has recently made history by becoming People's first-ever openly gay \"Sexiest Man Alive\".When asked by BBC News who his sexiest man of the year is, he didn’t skip a beat.“Jon M Chu,” he said, naming Wicked’s film director. “Because his genius, and his compassion, knows no end.”He then laughed, adding: “And because he cast me in this film, so that is entirely sexy.”PA MediaJonathan Bailey reprises his role of Prince Fiyero in the new filmThe sequel has a romantic plotline, which could lead some to wonder whether Bailey was channelling his inner Anthony (his Bridgerton character).“I’m sure I’m mining something that’s in my bones somewhere,” he says.As a sidebar, I also had to ask him whether would ever do Celebrity Traitors.“The answer is, we’ll have to find out,” he said, pausing dramatically before laughing. “I feel like I’m already exposing my game play.”When Grande unveiled her new look on Instagram recently, many fans speculated that it was a way for her to bid farewell to her Good Witch character.But when asked about that, she said: “No, I think it was just a way of doing something different for the second movie, and playing into the darker tones, with clothing and beauty.“It’s fun,” she said, while Erivo smiled and nodded.The films have been adapted from the hugely successful Broadway and West End musical, which itself was based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel.However, the stage musical was split into two films for its big-screen adaptation, with the second due to be released on 21 November.The two movies were shot simultaneously at Sky Studios Elstree in Hertfordshire between December 2022 and January 2024, with production interrupted mid-way through by the Hollywood actors' strike.PA MediaThe sequel will see co-star Michelle Yeoh join Grande and ErivoWicked was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations - winning two for best costume and production design.At two hours 40 minutes, the first film alone was almost as long as the entire length of the stage show.But the second film is slightly shorter, at 2 hours and 18 minutes.Erivo and Grande's chemistry and real-life friendship prompted several viral interview moments during the first film's promotional run last year, and the pair jointly opened the Academy Awards in March with a Wicked medley.One challenge facing the sequel is that most of the best known songs from the musical, such as Defying Gravity, Popular and The Wizard And I, featured in the first film.But the forthcoming follow-up will feature two brand new songs, with Chu telling BBC News that the first time Grande and Erivo heard them, “they just cried”.“It means a lot to now, however many years later, we’re here and people get to see it on the big screen. I’m so excited.”Wicked For Good is in cinemas on 21 November.",

    "description": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy",
    "body": "Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been released from jail, three weeks into a five-year prison term for taking part in a criminal conspiracy.He will be subject to strict judicial supervision and barred from leaving France ahead of an appeal trial due to be held next year.On 21 October, the former centre-right president, 70, was sentenced to five years for conspiring to fund his 2007 election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. His legal team immediately filed a request seeking his release.Writing on social media after the release, Sarkozy said his \"energy is focused solely on the single goal of proving my innocence.\"  \"The truth will prevail... The end of the story is yet to be written.\"Sarkozy's car was seen leaving La Santé prison in Paris just before 15:00 (14:00 GMT), less than an hour-and-a-half after a court agreed to his early release. Soon after, he was seen arriving at his home in western Paris.Christophe Ingrain, one of Sarkozy's lawyers, hailed his client's release as \"a step forward\" and said they would now be preparing for the appeal trial expected in March.One condition of Sarkozy's release is he does not contact any other witnesses in the so-called \"Libyan dossier\" or any justice ministry employees. During his incarceration, he was visited by Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin. The visit prompted 30 French lawyers to file a complaint against Darmanin, highlighting what they said was a conflict of interest as Darmanin was a former colleague and friend of Sarkozy's.Speaking to a court in Paris via video link on Monday morning, Sarkozy described his time in solitary confinement as \"gruelling\" and \"a nightmare\".He said he had never had the \"mad idea\" of asking Gaddafi for money and stated he would \"never admit to something I haven't done\".Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who had made his time in prison \"bearable\". \"They have shown exceptional humanity,\" he said.Sarkozy's wife, the singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and two of the former president's sons were present in the courtroom to support him. Sarkozy is the first French ex-leader placed behind bars since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Pétain was jailed for treason in 1945.Since entering prison, Sarkozy has been held in a cell in the isolation wing. He had a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV – for which he paid a monthly €14 (£12) fee – and the right to a small fridge.He also had the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits, as well as written and phone contact – but was in effect in solitary confinement. He was allowed just one hour a day for exercise, which he did by himself in the wing's segregated courtyard.Two bodyguards were stationed in nearby cells, which the interior minister Laurent Nuñez said was due to Sarkozy's status. There was \"obviously a threat against him\", Nuñez said.Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012. Ever since he left office, he has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.",

    "body": "9 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterEPA/ShutterstockA second migrant who had been sent from the UK to France under the government's \"one in, one out\" deal has returned to the UK, the Home Office has confirmed.The man was detained immediately, having been detected by biometrics, and will be sent back to France \"as quickly as possible\", the Home Office has said.The \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme with France is aimed at deterring migrants from coming to the UK in small boats across the English Channel.Last month, an Iranian man re-entered the UK by small boat one month after being removed to France. He was deported again last Wednesday.A Home Office spokesperson said officials would continue to catch and return anyone trying to re-enter the UK.\"Anyone looking to return to the UK after being removed under the UK-France agreement is wasting their time and money,\" the spokesperson said.\"This individual was detected by biometrics and detained immediately. His case will be expedited, and he will be returned to France as quickly as possible.\"The message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. We will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.\"The first flight carrying a cross-Channel small boat migrant, an Indian national, landed in Paris on 18 September.The UK-France deal for a pilot scheme was struck in September and aims to deter small boat crossings by returning migrants.About 100 men were detained after arriving in the UK on a small boat, sent to  immigration removal centres near Heathrow, and told they may be returned to France. Last week, the Home Office confirmed 94 migrants have been returned to France and 57 people have arrived in the UK under the scheme so far.More than 500 migrants crossed the Channel by small boat on Saturday, 349 on Sunday, and 39,075 have made the journey so far this year.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is now considering a major restructure of the UK's immigration rules modelled on Denmark's system. At Labour conference in September, Mahmood promised to \"do whatever it takes\" to regain control of Britain's borders and is said to be impressed that Denmark has driven down its number of successful asylum claims to a 40-year low.Mahmood wants to reduce incentives for people seeking to enter the UK by tightening rules on family reunions, and make it easier to remove those found to have no right to stay.Downing Street insisted that the detection of a second \"one in, one out\" migrant returning to the UK showed the system was working.The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"You've got a person who's arrived at the front door, who's been detected immediately, their journey has been wasted completely.\"They are in line to return to France, just as the previous case was - out of pocket and out of chances - they are destined to go back straight to France and their money spent on this dangerous crossing will have been spent in vain.\"Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Max Wilkinson accused the Home Office of \"staggering levels of incompetence\" and called for asylum seekers to be moved out of hotels as well as \"large-scale returns agreements\" with all safe countries. \"Failures like this show just how broken our system is,\" he said. \"Now is the time for Labour to back up their big promises with actions.\"Shadow home secretary Chris Philp nearly 18,000 migrants had arrived in the UK since the deal was struck, with \"only a handful removed...which is why they continue to flood in\". Philp said only the Conservatives had a clear plan to tackle illegal migration, saying the party would leave the ECHR and remove all illegal immigrants within a week of arrival.He added: \"But Keir Starmer doesn't have the backbone to do this, and Reform are a one-man band with no detailed plans.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "7 hours agoAlys DaviesAFP via Getty ImagesThe Prince of Wales has described how he and the Princess of Wales approached telling their children about difficult moments they have faced over the past two years, such as Catherine and King Charles' cancer diagnoses. \"We choose to communicate a lot more with our children... most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work\", Prince William said during an interview in Brazil.\"Every family has its own difficulties and its own challenges. It's very individual and sort of moment-dependent as to how you deal with those problems\", he added.The prince visited the Latin American country for the first time last week to mark the fifth Earthshot Prize, of which he is the founder and president.The prize celebrates people who have come up with ideas to help tackle issues affecting the planet. The winners of each category win £1m to further develop their ideas.Speaking to Brazilian TV host Luciano Huck in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the awards ceremony, which took place on 5 November, Prince William was asked how he and Catherine navigated the difficult things they have faced over the past two years.\"Sometimes you feel you're oversharing with the children\", said Prince William, who is father to Prince George, 12, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, seven. \"But most of the time, hiding stuff from them doesn't work, and so explaining how they feel, why that's happening, giving them other viewpoints as to why they might be feeling like they are sometimes helps give them a bigger picture, and they can relax more into it rather than being really anxious about 'what are you hiding from me'?\".\"There's a lot more questions when there's no answers.\"\"But it's always a balancing act\", he added, \"How much do I say? What do I say? When do I say it? There's no manual for being a parent, you've just got to go with it\".The Princess of Wales revealed she was in remission from cancer in January. King Charles continues to undergo treatment.In the interview, which covered a range of subjects, Prince William also said they do not allow their children to have phones.\"It's really hard. Our children don't have phones, I think when George moves onto secondary school then maybe he might have a phone that has limited access,\" he said.\"It's getting to the point where it's becoming a little bit of a tense issue but I think [Prince George] understands why, we communicate why we don't think it's right, and again I think it's the internet access we have a problem with. \"I think children can access too much stuff they don't need to see online,\" he said.He added that either he or Catherine do the school run most days and jokingly referred to himself as a taxi driver when conversing with Huck.Speaking about the Earthshot Prize, being held in Brazil for the first time this year, Prince William said: \"We're halfway through the ten years that we've identified as the decade of change, where if we want to leave a lasting legacy and really change the way we protect and restore and live on the planet we have to do it in this decade of change. \"So am I pleased with the progress the Earthshot has made and where the world is headed in environmental and climate leadership? Yes, I think we've made progress. Is there a lot more to do? Yes.\" Winners of this year's prize included a project to restore tropical forests and a global ocean treaty initiative.Following the trip to Rio, officials announced they would be making Prince William an honorary citizen of the city, known as a carioca.",

    "body": "The BBC has confirmed that Celebrity Traitors will return for a second series on BBC One in 2026, following a hugely successful debut that became one of the broadcaster's biggest entertainment hits.It will be hosted once again by Claudia Winkleman and filmed at Ardross Castle in the Scottish Highlands. Companion show Celebrity Traitors: Uncloaked will also return.An average of 11.1 million people tuned in to watch the final episode of this year's Celebrity version last week - the biggest live audience of the year for a single TV show.It was the highest overnight audience since the Gavin and Stacey finale, which attracted 12.3 million on Christmas Day last year, the BBC said.In July, England's victory in the Euro 2025 final had an average of 12 million who watched the match from start to finish, split across BBC One and ITV.The Celebrity Traitors finale saw traitors Cat Burns and Alan Carr, and faithfuls Joe Marler, Nick Mohammed and David Olusoga, compete for a £87,500 prize for charity.Comedian Alan Carr was crowned the winner of the series on Thursday evening after he convinced Mohammed and Olusoga that he was a faithful.An economic impact report, published on Monday, suggests the Traitors franchise - including the UK, US, and Celebrity editions – has added an estimated £21.8 million (gross value added) to Scotland's economy since production began in 2022.The report, compiled with Screen Scotland and Visit Scotland, credits the programme with supporting hundreds of local jobs and promoting the Highlands as a filming destination.The Traitors, based on a Dutch format created by Marc Pos, first aired on BBC One in 2022 and has since become an international phenomenon, spawning multiple editions worldwide including in Australia, Canada and Italy.Kalpna Patel-Knight, head of entertainment at the BBC, said the show had \"truly captivated the nation, becoming a bona fide highlight of the year\".She added: \"In 2026 the doors of the castle will be opened again to welcome celebrity players to the game to see who can charm, who can scheme and ultimately who can survive in series two which promises to be just as unmissable as the first.\"A fourth season of Traitors UK will also air in 2026.

    "body": "3 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr at the White House & Raffi BergSyria will join the international coalition to combat the Islamic State group, marking a shift in US foreign policy in the Middle East, a senior Trump administration official confirmed to CBS, the BBC's US media partner.The announcement came as President Donald Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa at the White House - the first such visit from a Syrian leader in the country's history.Diplomatic relations between Syria and the US have been suspended since 2012, although Trump has moved to restore them after the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad.Trump has expressed his support for al-Sharaa, who until recently was designated a terrorist by the US government.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office several hours after the meeting, Trump said that \"we want to see Syria become a country that's very successful.\" \"And I think this leader can do it,\" he added. \"I really do.\" Trump said more \"announcements\" are forthcoming, although he provided no details.This is the third meeting between the two leaders, following one in May on the sidelines of the Gulf Cooperation Council and a dinner during the UN General Assembly in September. Al-Sharaa's visit to the White House caps a remarkable re-branding for the former jihadist. Not long ago, he led a branch of Al-Qaeda - the group behind the 9/11 attacks and many others - before breaking off ties. Even until this year, he was the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an armed Islamist group which the US officially considered a terrorist organisation until four months ago, with a $10m bounty on his head. The Treasury Department removed al-Sharaa from its \"specially designated global terrorist list\" just last week.But since becoming interim Syrian president, al-Sharaa has worked to soften his public image as he tries to rebuild Syria, with foreign support, following 13 years of war. \"He has had a rough past,\" Trump said on Monday. \"And I think, frankly, if you didn't have a rough past, you wouldn't have a chance.\" Al-Sharaa's rule, however, has been marred by killings of members of Syria's Alawite minority, as well as by deadly violence between Sunni Bedouin fighters and Druze militias.He has vowed to root out members of his security forces that have committed human rights violations. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly expressed support for al-Sharaa, referring to him as a \"young, attractive guy\" and a \"fighter\" with a \"strong past\". In June, President Trump signed an executive order lifting sanctions against Syria, which the White House said would help support the country's \"path to stability and peace\". At the time, the administration said it would monitor the new Syrian government's actions, including \"taking steps toward normalising ties with Israel\" and addressing \"foreign terrorists\" and militant groups operating in the country.

    "body": "3 hours agoKatie RazzallCulture and Media EditorI don't like the word unprecedented. But I've used it twice in less than 24 hours.The first time was on Sunday night, after the resignations of Tim Davie and Deborah Turness. That, in fact, might have involved a bit of overreach.After all, this has happened before at the BBC. Back in 2004, two senior figures departed - admittedly not on the same day, but on subsequent days.The then BBC chairman, Gavyn Davies, and the director general, Greg Dyke, resigned in light of the Hutton report. That was the inquiry into the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly which found that the BBC's reporting on the Iraq \"sexed-up dossier\" was flawed.But my use of unprecedented on Monday feels entirely appropriate.A US president threatening to sue the BBC for $1bn is completely new territory for the corporation.We've seen a succession of US media operations previously cave in as Donald Trump launched lawsuits. Paramount Global paid him $16m to settle a dispute over an interview broadcast on CBS with former vice-president Kamala Harris. ABC News paid him $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit after its anchor falsely claimed he had been found \"liable for rape\".Now the president has the BBC in his sights. He wants a full retraction of the Panorama documentary, an apology for the \"false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements\" made about him in it, and appropriate compensation \"for the harm caused\".If he doesn't get them by Friday, he's put the BBC \"on notice\" that he will be looking for damages of \"no less than $1,000,000,000\".Whether you are a supporter or a detractor of the BBC, I think everyone would agree these are incredibly testing times for the corporation.Events have developed rapidly over a week.First we got the series of claims about the Panorama documentary and also wider systemic bias first made in the Telegraph.Six days later came the resignations of director general Tim Davie and news CEO Deborah Turness.Quickly some were voicing concerns about a politically orchestrated campaign against the BBC from the right. Others said this was all about accountability in the face of gross failures.Now the BBC faces a potentially very costly legal battle with Donald Trump.It should be basking in the success of Celebrity Traitors with the programme's hugely popular finale broadcast just last Thursday. Instead the BBC is plunged into a crisis some would argue of its own making.It's taken until Monday to apologise for the Panorama edit and to push back on the notion that the corporation suffers from institutional bias.The interview I did with BBC chair Samir Shah should have been done much earlier - with the DG or Deborah Turness last week, as the headlines ramped up.The apology should have come then. Now the BBC is on the back foot.It will take robust leadership to steer a course through. But two of the leaders most likely to have been able to steady the ship are now on the way out.",

It's just not like any other book,\" said author Roddy Doyle, who chaired the judging panel. \"It's a dark book, but we all found it a joy to read.\"Actress Sarah Jessica Parker was among the other Booker judges, while Flesh has been championed by Dua Lipa and Stormzy.Getty ImagesDua Lipa interviewed David Szalay at New York Public Library in SeptemberSzalay told the BBC he was feeling a \"bit dazed\" after winning the prize and it was going to take a while to \"sink in\". \"I did maybe too thorough a job of convincing myself that I wasn't going to win in order to get through the evening without too much stress, and now I have to catch up a bit in my head,\" he said. \"But it's fantastic, of course.\" Stormzy recorded an extract of the book for a short film that was played at the Booker Prize ceremony in London on Monday.And Dua Lipa described it as a \"tense and gripping read\" when she picked it for her book club last month.Flesh has had rave reviews across the board.The Guardian called it a \"brilliantly spare portrait of a man\" and a \"thrilling exploration of what it means to be alive\", while the Sunday Times praised how Szalay uses \"just one character, Istvan, to tell these three stages of modern man\".Blank pagesCritics and judges have also praised Szalay's pared-down, minimalist dialogue and descriptions.\"We loved the spareness of the writing,\" Doyle explained. \"We loved how so much is revealed without us being overly aware of it being revealed. \"It's just extraordinary how he uses white space. Grief is depicted by a few blank pages.\"Referring to the writing style, Doyle added: \"I found it riveting, and I thought the dialogue was superb - and the absence of it was superb.\"Booker organisers described Flesh as \"a meditation on class, power, intimacy, migration and masculinity\", and called it \"a compelling portrait of one man, and the formative experiences that can reverberate across a lifetime\".'Honest and heartbreaking'The judges spent more than five hours discussing the six shortlisted novels before settling on the winner. Doyle said it became \"very clear that this was the book that all five of us liked most\".\"They found it spare, disciplined, urgent, honest and heartbreaking,\" said Gaby Wood, chief executive of the Booker Prize Foundation.\"With Flesh, they all agreed, David Szalay breaks new ground. I share the judges' excitement over the work of an author who has been writing with ferocious and stark commitment for many years.\"Flesh is Szalay's sixth novel, and he was previously nominated for the Booker for All That Man Is, another exploration of modern masculinity, in 2016.He collected £50,000 as this year's winner.The other shortlisted novels were:Yuki Sugiura/Booker Prize FoundationSusan Choi - FlashlightKiran Desai - The Loneliness of Sonia and SunnyKatie Kitamura - AuditionBen Markovits - The Rest of Our LivesAndrew Miller - The Land in WinterThe Booker Prize is the UK's most prestigious fiction award and is open to novels written in the English language.Past winners include Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Bernardine Evaristo, Hilary Mantel and Douglas Stuart.",

Smith says that beneath the chaos, it's \"a really touching story about a father and son\". Cave nods in agreement, adding that the tale of Bunny makes him want to hug his kids. \"It's a reminder of the vulnerability of our children and of the need to hold them while there's still time.\"Set in 2003 in Brighton, the adaptation turns Cave's novel into a period piece that feels close enough to the present day but distant enough to reflect how the world, and its tolerance for men like Bunny, has changed.But both men resist saying that the show makes a statement about masculinity.\"That's for other people to decide,\" Smith says. \"But for me, it's really a story about the sins of the father and about Bunny Junior breaking that cycle.\"Cave calls it a story about inheritance - what we carry from our parents and what we choose to leave behind. \"Little Bunny needs to get away from his father as he's chaotic and a threat to his safety but Bunny is essentially good and we wouldn't want his son to escape those parts of him.\" Sky UKBunny takes his son on a chaotic road trip after his wife takes her own lifeThe singer also suggests it's much deeper than an exploration of masculinity as it reflects \"how we deal with our own nature and humanity.\"That sense of humanity has always been at the core of Cave's work and his music with The Bad Seeds is \"essentially autobiographical\".In 2015, Cave's son Arthur died after falling from a cliff in Brighton and in 2022 his eldest son, Jethro, died at the age of 30.The singer has previously written about the \"vastness\" of his grief and about how the death of his sons changed him. He also moved to Los Angeles because \"Brighton had just become too sad\" but he later returned after he \"realised that, regardless of where we lived, we just took our sadness with us\".\"If you listen to my songs and the words, they paint a very clear picture of what I'm like and what I've gone through,\" he tells the BBC. \"Even the despicable characters, they're not removed from me, they are just part of a complex character.\"In contrast, Cave explains that Bunny Munro isn't autobiographical but there is some overlap between his life and that of his creation.\"I wasn't writing about someone I didn't understand,\" he says. \"I felt extremely connected to Bunny - not that I went around trying to seduce women, though there was a bit of that, being in a band and all – but that interior masculine monologue, that first impulse towards being in the world.\"Most men, if they're honest, understand Bunny on some level.\"However, Cave says that where he differs most from Bunny is when it comes to women as he's \"much shyer around women\".His confession strips away any rock-star bravado as he admits that he's \"quite terrified of women and their power and I've just never been that comfortable around them\".The Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic from 20 November.",

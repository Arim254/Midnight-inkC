The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria. Anti-government youth protesters in South Korea are taking cues from the American right's MAGA movement. Italy announces a fee for tourists to visit the Trevi Fountain in Rome. Putin vows revenge on Ukraine after an oil tanker was blown up in the Mediterranean Sea. Palestinians tell the BBC they were sexually abused in Israeli prisons.

    "body": "Watch: Moment German engineer becomes world's first wheelchair user to go into spaceAn engineer from Germany has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. Michaela Benthaus, who suffered a spinal cord injury in a mountain bike accident seven years ago, had reached out to a retired space engineer online to see if her dream of being an astronaut was still possible. He then helped organise the historic 10-minute flight with Blue Origin, the space tourism company founded by Jeff Bezos. Ms Benthaus and five others blasted off from Texas on Saturday and reached a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space, known as the Kármán line.\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing in a video shared by Blue Origin.\"I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"New Shepard, Blue Origin's reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle, took off from the company's Texas launch pad at 14:15 GMT.Ms Benthaus, who works at the European Space Agency, said she had \"really, really figured out how inaccessible our world still is\" for people with disabilities following her accident.She made her own way from her wheelchair into the capsule, using a bench extending from the hatch. Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organise the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Ms Benthaus said. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?\" Koenigsmann said Ms Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. \"It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time,\" he said.Blue Origin said ground support equipment was added to help Ms Benthaus enter and exit the capsule. \"Michi's flight is particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone, and we are proud to help her achieve this dream,\" Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said. The cost of the mission, which is the 16th suborbital space tourism launch carried out by Blue Origin, has not been revealed. The company has taken dozens of tourists to space. In April, pop star Katy Perry, Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King were among six women blasted into space aboard a Blue Origin rocket for a flight that lasted about 11 minutes.The high-profile flights come at a time when private space companies are fiercely competing for dominance in space tourism.

    "body": "Anxious waits for arrivals are nothing new at Christmas as people track special deliveries.But for one Shropshire woman, the package two years ago was more precious than something due in the post. It was the child she adopted - the sister of the boy she had made part of her family the year before.\"[We were] on tenterhooks as to whether she would be here for Christmas,\" remembered Sarah, 44.She was not disappointed. In that December of 2023 she formally became a mum of two. Adopting siblings, she said, was \"the best decision I ever made\". It was, then, the best of times and the busiest of times. Christmas, she recalled, \"is carnage in the best possible way with small children\". And it was a journey to get there. It began when Sarah found out she would be unlikely to have a healthy pregnancy. Her story took a huge stride forward when she adopted her son in July 2022.Sarah described how she had read the then 17-month-old's profile prior to adoption and \"knew he was mine\". She said she \"got butterflies\".She then found out that her son's birth mother was pregnant, and decided to put herself forward as a potential parent for this new baby, should that be needed.The girl, the half sister of Sarah's son, was born on Christmas Day 2022, and the family became a trio the following December.They are about to celebrate their third Christmas together, but Sarah insists on trying to make \"every day special\".She said: \"If I see in a shop a toy or something that I think they'd like, I'll buy it, because it doesn't have to wait until one single day a year.\"Especially with adopted children, a lot of them have trauma in some way, shape or form.\"They can push you away because they feel unsafe. But if you can show them that you aren't going anywhere and you're there forever – if it means that once a month they get a treat – then so be it.\"And to be honest,\" she said, \"as long as the children are happy and content and have got somewhere safe, especially at Christmas, that's what matters.\"",

    "body": "9 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent An appeal for information has been sent to all MI5 staff over false evidence the service gave to three courts in a neo-Nazi spy case.MI5's regulator is investigating how it came to make false claims about conversations with the BBC.The Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson, who is overseeing the inquiry, said it was \"surprising\" that new material was being uncovered years after the case began.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ordered the investigation in September after the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts.The prime minister's demand followed requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened. MI5 also gave false evidence to its regulator, Sir Brian Leveson himself, whose office is conducting this new investigation.The case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X, who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.Sir Brian has now sent a letter updating the prime minister, the attorney general and the home secretary on the investigation into the false evidence. In the letter, he reveals the investigation team \"asked that a message be disseminated to all current MI5 staff\", inviting anyone who believes they have information which may assist, to make contact. He adds: \"I am grateful for MI5's prompt and constructive engagement to achieve this.\"But he also notes that \"relevant material\" continues to be identified, adding that it is \"surprising\" four years after the case began and \"over three years after my inspectors first considered the Agent X case.\"Earlier this month, MI5 was heavily criticised by the police investigation into the state agent Stakeknife for only disclosing crucial documents years after that inquiry began. The investigation into the false evidence in the Agent X case is being led by Sir John Goldring, the Deputy Investigatory Powers Commissioner.In the update letter, it is revealed that Sir John and his investigators have interviewed 36 people over the past five weeks, including \"current and former staff of the intelligence services\", as well as BBC staff, government lawyers, and barristers representing MI5.The new investigation is said to have identified \"additional lines of inquiry\" after obtaining material beyond that which was disclosed in the three court cases. The investigation report is not expected to be completed before March.In February this year, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation. Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities.In fact, MI5 had disclosed Agent X's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate him. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls.Following the BBC's revelations, MI5's Director General Sir Ken McCallum issued an \"unreserved apology\" for the false evidence.Two official inquiries then took place which absolved MI5 and its officers of deliberate wrongdoing, claiming the false evidence was down to mistakes and poor memories.But, in July, a panel of senior high court judges ruled that the \"investigations carried out by MI5 to date suffer from serious procedural deficiencies\" and that \"we cannot rely on their conclusions\".They said it would be \"premature\" to decide whether to begin contempt of court proceedings against any MI5 officers before a new investigation took place.Sir Ken previously said the service would co-operate fully with the new inquiry.",

    "body": "Former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas Skinner has claimed the BBC rigged the vote that saw him leave the show.The social media personality alleged in an online post that the night he left the competition he was sent an \"anonymous email claiming to be from a BBC exec with stats\" that showed he had \"received far more votes than it appeared\".He went on to say the email also claimed the BBC was \"angry\" and \"nervous\" over his meeting the US Vice-President JD Vance.It follows reports Skinner is suing the BBC over claims the vote was rigged against him. A BBC spokesperson rejected the allegation, saying Strictly's public vote was \"independently overseen and verified to ensure complete accuracy\".They added: \"Any claims to the contrary are entirely without foundation.\"PromoVeritas, the company which verifies the show's public vote, said all the votes it receives are \"validated\" and \"independently and comprehensively verified by two auditors\".It is understood the BBC is not aware of any legal complaint over the matter.Skinner was the first celebrity contestant to be voted out in this year's series.Ahead of Saturday's final - which sees former contestants return - he announced he would not be attending.\"I spoke with my lovely dance partner, Amy Dowden to make sure she was okay with me not attending,\" he wrote in a lengthy post on X, explaining he was commenting publicly \"so people know the truth\" regarding his absence.\"I don't want people thinking I am bitter when I ain't.\"Skinner claimed he had the authenticity of the alleged email from a BBC executive \"independently verified\", though it is unclear how he did so.He said he had asked to see the official voting tallies \"to back up the ones I was sent in the email but was told they couldn't be shown to me\" and \"have never been shown in the history of the show\".He added that there were \"smaller things\" that added to the feeling of \"how unfair it all was\", such as his welcome gift to the show being the only one that \"got stolen apparently\".The BBC spokesperson said Skinner had yet to share the email with anyone from the broadcaster \"despite requests for it\", and so they were unable to comment.They added that the Strictly team \"categorically did not supply 'welcome gifts' to any of the cast\".Skinner first hit TV screens on The Apprentice in 2019, and has since appeared on shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats, Michael McIntyre's Big Show, Good Morning Britain and Celebrity Masterchef. He is also due to appear on Celebrity Apprentice this Christmas.He is also known for his social media videos encouraging people to think positively, which typically end with a trademark \"bosh\".But he has attracted criticism in recent months for meeting Donald Trump's vice-president over the summer and being pictured wearing a Make America Great Again cap.Skinner stressed in his post that he was \"not a political bloke\", adding: \"I just love my country and am patriotic.\"He said he had a \"private\" Zoom call with BBC executives on Wednesday about \"going forward\" that had been leaked and was \"national news\" by the following morning.",

    "body": "3 days agoChristian FullerSouth EastJuliette ThymiSenior technician James Wood stepped in to the dame role of Sherie Trifle with 45 minutes' noticeAfter pantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill before a performance, the show seemed destined to be cancelled.But in true theatre fashion, the phrase \"the show must go on\" was put into action as senior technician James Wood took his place at the Hazlitt Theatre in Maidstone, Kent, with 45 minutes' notice.After years of working at the venue, the unlikely understudy took centre stage in the dame role of Sherie Trifle at the near sold-out performance.Despite no rehearsal time, the light operator said: \"It was loads of fun and my feet hurt from the heels. But it is all worth it for our Hazlitt audience.\"Mr Wood said he was armed with nothing but Dame Sherie Trifle's recipe book, filled with his lines, an outrageous wardrobe and a performance degree from Canterbury Christ Church University.\"I did train to be a performer when I was at university, but I wasn't expecting my stage debut to be in a dress,\" he said.The senior technician ended up starring in all of the theatre's weekend performances of Dick Whittington & His Cat.Dan BaughPantomime dame Joe Meloy fell ill and was unable to perform at the Hazlitt Theatre in MaidstoneAudience member Rachel Gadd said: \"As someone who has seen a fair few pantomimes in their day, I can safely say this was the best show I've seen.\"Of course, the show was fabulous on its own, but with the wonderful James standing in, it really added another layer of charm. \"I think the act of stepping up and helping people out is really what Christmas is all about.\"Director and producer Martin Cleverley, on behalf of Parkwood Theatres, added: \"In over a decade of producing panto, the Hazlitt has never seen their light operator step in for the panto dame.\"2026 will see a new special clause that sees all technical staff add panto understudy to their job role.\"Professional dancer Brad Wright also stepped in for Jared Leathwood in the title role of Dick Whittington that night, while fellow professional dancer Luke Baugh stepped in for Emmanuel Duarte as Idle Jack earlier in the run.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "The US has seized a vessel in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, US officials have told BBC News partner CBS.It is the second time this month that the US has seized a ship off the country's coast. The move comes after US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he was ordering a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.Venezuela has not yet responded to the latest US seizure, but has previously accused Washington of seeking to steal its oil resources. The BBC has contacted the White House for comment.The operation was led by the US Coast Guard, similar to the operation earlier this month, CBS reports. The ship was boarded by a specialised tactical team.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.The US has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.The US has accused Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro of leading a designated-terrorist organisation called Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.The Trump administration accuses him of and the group of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\".Venezuela - which is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.Trump's announcement of a \"blockade\" came less than a week after the US seized an oil tanker believed to be part of the \"ghost fleet\" off the coast of Venezuela, which allegedly used various strategies to conceal its work.The White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port.Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.",

    "body": "10 hours agoCarrie Davies,BBC Pakistan correspondentandAnna LamcheFormer Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have been sentenced to further jail terms following a fraud case involving state gifts.They were convicted of breaking Pakistan's rules on gifts after Bibi was given a luxury jewellery set by Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit.The pair are already serving time in prison for earlier convictions, and the new sentences - 10 years for criminal breach of trust and seven years for criminal misconduct, and a fine - will reportedly run concurrently to their earlier terms.Khan has described the charges as politically motivated and his lawyer told BBC News his team plan to challenge the verdict.Speaking to the BBC after the hearing, the former prime minister's lawyer, Salman Safdar, said Khan's legal team had only been informed about the sentencing late on Friday night, after normal court hours.They planned to mount a challenge to the verdict in the high court, Mr Safdar said.This case is the latest in a series of charges laid against the cricket star-turned-politician, who has been detained since August 2023. In January, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison over a separate corruption case.He has faced charges in more than 100 cases, ranging from leaking state secrets to selling state gifts. The BBC has been unable to confirm the exact number brought against him.The jewellery case, referred to as Toshakhana 2 in Pakistan, concerns a Bulgari jewellery set given to Bushra Bibi by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a state visit in 2021, according to court documents. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items go to Pakistan's Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians are able to purchase the items back.Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewellery set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.In addition to their jail terms, the pair were handed a fine of over 16 million Pakistani rupees (£42,600).Khan was also convicted in an earlier, different Toshakhana case - but he challenged that conviction, meaning his sentence is suspended until the outcome of his appeal. He also has other cases outstanding against him.These include terrorism charges relating to violent protests that took place on 9 May 2023, when he was previously arrested.Khan was Pakistan's prime minister until April 2022 when he was ousted in a vote of no confidence.Although he has not been seen in public, his social media accounts have continued to operate with messages attributed to him on X often appearing after jail visits.These have been highly critical of Pakistan's current government and its politically powerful army Chief Field Marshall Asim Munir, including posts calling him a tyrannical dictator.In November, he was denied any visitors for nearly a month.After campaigning by his family and party, his sister was allowed to visit in early December; a few hours after she saw him, his account posted a comment credited to Khan calling the Field Marshall Asim Munir a \"mentally unstable person\". Khan has not been allowed any family visits since.The judgement states the judge was lenient in sentencing because of Khan's \"old age\".Update: This story was updated to clarify the latest legal status of Khan's earlier, separate Toshakhana case.",

    "body": "6 hours agoNoor NanjiRoyal correspondentUS Department of JusticeA photo of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying on the laps of women is among the thousands of Epstein files which have been released by the US Department of Justice.In the picture, convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell hovers in the background smiling at the former prince. The photo appears to have been taken in the saloon room at Sandringham, the royal estate in Norfolk.The emergence of the photo will add to scrutiny on Mr Mountbatten-Windsor, after he was stripped of his remaining titles and honours over his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.Two of the photos also show Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, in the company of women whose faces are covered by black squares.Ms Ferguson's representatives declined to comment.Simply appearing in the photos or documents is not evidence of wrongdoing.US Department of JusticeSarah Ferguson is pictured in some of the photosThe heavily-redacted tranche of some of the so-called Epstein files - the long-awaited documents relating to the US Department of Justice's investigations into Epstein - were released on Friday night.The documents were highly anticipated after Congress passed a law mandating the files be released in their entirety by 19 December.They contain photos of the interiors of Epstein's homes, his overseas travels and celebrities including US President Bill Clinton, Mr Mountbatten-Windsor and Michael Jackson. President Donald Trump was hardly mentioned in the files.Many of those identified in other releases, including President Trump, have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.In the undated picture of Andrew, the former prince - now 65 - looks much younger. He is smiling with his eyes closed.The faces of those with him, who are sitting in front of a grand fireplace, have been redacted with black squares. The photo appears to be at Sandringham, King Charles's private estate in Norfolk.In another picture, he appears to be at Royal Ascot with Epstein and Maxwell.US Department of JusticeJeffrey Epstein, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Ghislaine Maxwell appear to be in the royal box at AscotAlso among the files are undated photos of Maxwell standing outside the door of 10 Downing Street.In the picture she is alone and no context was provided with the photo about why she is there or when the image was taken.US Department of JusticeThe issue over Andrew’s friendship with Epstein has continued to dog the royals.The King stripped his younger brother of his prince title following weeks of intense pressure over his links to the paedophile financier.He is also expected to shortly move out of his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge.It came after Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - as he is now known - gave up his other royal titles, including the Duke of York, after more questions and allegations about his private life.At the start of this year, emails showed that he had stayed in contact with Epstein for longer than he had previously admitted.In a posthumous memoir published in October, Virginia Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - repeated allegations that, as a teenager, she had sex with Andrew on three separate occasions. Andrew has always strenuously denied the claims.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities. He had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.Separately, two photos of Ms Ferguson - then the Duchess of York - have emerged in the document dump.One shows her standing on a pavement next to an unidentified woman holding a shopping bag. In the other, she is sitting cross legged on a green sofa.US Department of JusticeMs Ferguson has also faced her own Epstein controversy earlier this year, after an email from 2011 revealed she called him her \"supreme friend\".Multiple charities dropped the then-Duchess of York as a patron or ambassador after the emergence of that email, in which she also seemed to apologise for her public criticism of him.The extensive redactions have been criticised by Democrats for violating the transparency law.But the White House says the Trump administration is the \"most transparent in history\", as the DoJ says it has \"erred on the side of redacting to protect victims\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoJaroslav LukivUS President Donald Trump: \"We hit every site flawlessly\"The US says its military has carried out a \"massive strike\" against the Islamic State group (IS) in Syria, in response to a deadly attack on American forces in the country.The US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery \"struck more than 70 targets at multiple locations across central Syria\". Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.It said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.President Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.In a statement on X, Centcom – which directs American military operations in the Middle East, north-east Africa, central and southern Asia – said Operation Hawkeye Strike was launched at 16:00 Eastern Time (21:00 GMT) on Friday.Centcom commander Admiral Brad Cooper said that the US \"will continue to relentlessly pursue terrorists who seek to harm Americans and our partners across the region\".Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), told news agency AFP that \"at least five members of the Islamic State group were killed\" in eastern Syria's Deir ez Zor province, including the leader of a cell responsible for drones in the area.Petra, Jordan's state-run news agency, announced the Royal Jordanian Air Force had participated in the strikes to \"prevent extremist groups\" from \"threaten[ing] the security of Syria's neighbours and the wider region\".IS has not publicly commented. The BBC was unable to immediately verify the targets.US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the operation \"is not the beginning of a war - it is a declaration of vengeance. \"If you target Americans - anywhere in the world - you will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,\" the US defence secretary added.US Air Force/ReutersThe US Army identified the two soldiers killed in the attack as Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, 25, and Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, 29Posting on Truth Social, President Trump said the US \"is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible\".He said the Syrian government was \"fully in support\".Centcom earlier said that the deadly attack in Palmyra was carried out by an IS gunman, who was \"engaged and killed\".Another three US soldiers were injured in the ambush, with a Pentagon official saying that it happened \"in an area where the Syrian president does not have control.\"At the same time, the SOHR said the attacker was a member of the Syrian security forces.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the identity of the gunman has not been released.US Air Force/ReutersA US Air Force photo handout shows a KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft taking offIn 2019, a US-backed alliance of Syrian fighters announced IS had lost the last pocket of territory in Syria it controlled, but since then the jihadist group has carried out some attacks.The United Nations says the group still has between 5,000 and 7,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq.US troops have maintained a presence in Syria since 2015 to help train other forces as part of a campaign against IS.Syria has recently joined an international coalition to combat IS and has pledged to co-operate with the US.In November, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa - a former jihadist leader whose coalition forces toppled Bashar al-Assad's regime in 2024 - met Trump at the White House, describing his visit as part of a \"new era\" for the two countries.",

    "body": "A wildlife park has welcomed the birth of its second rhino calf in 2025, marking a rare success for the species in captivity.Cotswold Wildlife Park said the female, named Mo, was born to Ruby, a 19-year-old white rhino, earlier than keepers expected. She is Ruby's sixth calf with breeding male Monty and the 13th rhino born at the Oxfordshire park in the past 12 years.It is difficult to catch rhino births on camera as females usually give birth during the night but the quick-thinking team at the park managed record the unique moment.Her arrival follows the birth of a male calf, Markus, to another female, Nancy, earlier this year and the pair are the only white rhinos born in the UK in 2025.Across Europe, just six calves were born in 2025 and park curator Jamie Craig said: \"To have such a successful record breeding this incredible species is down to our team of dedicated keepers. \"A paddock full of rhino is a great sight and the new arrivals are certainly keeping the team on their toes.\"After some wobbly first steps Mo has already been delighting visitors with playful charges in the Rhino paddock.She has met some of her older sisters and will stay with her mother for at least two years, benefiting from her protection. Females guard their offspring aggressively and are intimidating adversaries if challenged.She was named in honour of Maureen Clifford, a long-serving member of staff who worked at the park for nearly four decades.Maureen, affectionately known as \"Mo\" to close friends, still visits with her family and is delighted that the new calf is named after her.White rhinos were once on the brink of extinction, with fewer than 50 animals remaining in the early 1900s. Thanks to conservation efforts, they are now the most common of the five rhino species, though poaching remains a serious threat.Cotswold Wildlife Park works with UK charity Tusk to support conservation in Africa and has raised more than £120,000 for the cause over the past decade.",

We spent all our summer holidays here, so I've kind of grown up here,\" said Jennie.She gets \"quite emotional\" at the thought of leaving but, after her father died last year, she realised it was time for a new chapter.Jennie BaileyJennie and John Bailey and their sons Henry and Sebastian turned their holiday home into their full-time residence nearly three years agoOne of Jennie's best friends sent her a link to an article about a woman in Ireland who raffled off her home and the idea stayed with her.\"My first response was 'don't be so stupid, there's no way in the world I'm doing that'.\"But curiosity got the better of me and I spent probably a month really researching it. I got loads of legal advice, which was really difficult to get because a lot of people just don't understand it.\"Michael SpeakThe two-bedroom flat is one of three properties inside a converted house by the beachJennie and John had to take the property off the market when they set up the raffle using an online platform.Tickets are £5 each and their goal was to sell 150,000 in six months, with a deadline of 1 January.Even if they do, they won't get £750,000 as 10% goes to the platform, as well as costs such as legal fees, stamp duty and marketing.As of Friday, the family had sold 50,531 tickets.If they don't hit their goal, they'll keep the property and the winner of the raffle draw will get half of the pot with the other half going towards covering costs, then the family can keep anything left.Jennie BaileyThe Bailey family have always enjoyed spending holidays by the sea, but decided to make the permanent move to Anglesey in 2023Which? Money has previously said entrants should pay close attention to terms and conditions, and that the number of failed housing raffles \"far outweighs the small number of successes\".Jennie said friends had told them about negative comments online and in person surrounding the raffle, including the cost of the flat and the fact they are not originally from the area, but \"I've just ignored it all\".She added: \"We're genuinely just a family who are trying to sell our property in a bit of an unusual way.\"It gives a chance for someone who might not be able to buy this kind of property - £5 is like a coffee these days.\"If you don't like it, just don't enter.\"Michael SpeakWhat started as a holiday home became a permanent residence when the family moved from ManchesterJennie said \"only a low percentage of people actually complete\" after doing this type of raffle, but she was staying optimistic as the latter stages of the raffle tended to be when more tickets were sold.She said the experience had been \"a complete learning curve\" as she had no idea how to approach marketing or the other skills needed before attempting it.\"I work on this every day. Some days all day long, sometimes at night,\" said Jennie, who also runs a handmade home decor business, while John works from home as a packaging designer.\"It's really hard. I don't know whether what I'm doing is right or not, I'm just literally trying anything and everything.\"Would I recommend it? If you can be quite thick-skinned and just carry on, then yes, do it. But you've got to devote time to it.\"Michael SpeakAs 11-year-old Henry and Sebastian, nine, grow up, they crave their own space, Jennie saysStelios Kounou, founder and CEO of global raffle technology firm Raffall, said the first house raffle on his platform took place in 2020 and, since then, it had hosted 54 UK and Ireland house raffle attempts, 18 of which had resulted in the property being exchanged.\"I don't see this becoming a trend,\" he said, adding house raffles were not something he had thought about when first setting up his company.\"People who do this know probability of success might be low but, for those willing to put in the hard work, the time risk is worth the possible reward.\"The Bailey family plans to stay in the area once they sell the property, but Jennie admits they'll miss the beach view.\"It would be amazing to see someone else enjoy this like we've done. \"More top storiesRelated internet links",

    "body": "6 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorHurtling into view, noisily and quickly, comes another twist in the rollercoaster that is diplomacy in the era of President Trump.Splenetic social media posts, bold claims in front of the cameras and provocative and to some deeply offensive AI-generated images of an American-owned Greenland.And now, so many of America's allies allow themselves a deep breath and an expression of relief.Just as so many of the furious rows begin on social media under this US president, this latest one has cooled considerably via social media too - with another post on his platform Truth Social.Within the government here in the UK, there is a quiet pride that Britain made its contribution to the welter of diplomacy European neighbours and others have been doing in recent days.I hear that the British diplomatic machine cranked up at every level: involving ministers, officials and embassies.The prime minister insisted on what he saw as the merits of \"calm discussion\" - but had to judge how to calibrate his response, both publicly and privately.At the core of this row, there was a fundamental public disagreement between Downing Street and the White House, something Sir Keir Starmer has sought to avoid where possible.But for him the integrity of a state - with Greenland's future being for Greenlanders and Denmark to decide - was a non-negotiable bottom line.In the 48 hours or so since spelling that out explicitly, in front of the cameras, on Monday morning, risk hung in the air - could the carefully cultivated relationship with President Trump be uprooted before our eyes?By Tuesday morning, it looked like the answer could be yes, with the president sounding off in capital letters about the government's deal to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, an arrangement he had previously endorsed.What might come next? Again Downing Street held its breath, before deciding to notch up its critique in the Commons on Wednesday.The prime minister told MPs he would \"not yield\" over his support for Greenland, despite the threat of tariffs. His team knew this wasn't without risk.Now, almost as quickly as the row accelerated, President Trump has hit the brakes.A deal has been done, the threat of tariffs and reality of tub thumping language has gone.And yes, we have heard this album before.The president makes a provocative and to many outrageous suggestion, reaction around the world scatters in multiple directions, the White House has seized the agenda.The world, or at least the West, splutters, frets, contorts and argues – and a solution is arrived at, but not before so many are brutally reminded of America's brute force, when led by a man happy to be brutish in his approach.And America's friends and foes, catching their breath, ponder what will prompt the next diplomatic grenade from the Oval Office.",

    "body": "Australia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, has split after a row over hate speech laws, casting the future of Liberal leader Sussan Ley into doubt.The centre-right Coalition, which has been on rocky ground since a resounding election loss last year, had been divided over how to respond to reforms moved by the government after a terror attack targeting a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach killed 15 people last month.The Nationals ultimately refused to follow the shadow cabinet decision, a breach of longstanding Coalition rules.\"Our party room has made it clear that we cannot be part of a shadow ministry under Sussan Ley,\" leader David Littleproud told reporters.Announcing the split on Thursday - a national day of mourning for those killed in the shooting on 14 December - Littleproud said the Coalition \"was made untenable\".He did not rule out a return to the Coalition, refusing to \"speculate\", but said it was \"probably a good thing\" if Australia's two main conservative parties spent \"some time apart\".It is the second time in less than a year that the Nationals have pulled out of the Coalition, with a brief split - largely over climate and energy policy - in May last year resolved within a week.Ley, whose leadership is under pressure, is yet to comment on the split. She released a statement on Thursday to mark the national day of mourning, saying \"my responsibility as leader of the opposition and leader of the Liberal party is to Australians in mourning\".Though both parties in the Coalition voted against legislation tightening gun controls, the Liberals had sided with the Labor government on Tuesday to pass hate speech reforms introduced after the Bondi Beach attack.But their Nationals colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the senate, despite a shadow cabinet agreement, citing concerns that the legislation had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.The laws includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.On Wednesday three Nationals frontbenchers offered their resignations, which Ley accepted despite a warning from Littleproud that if she accepted them the rest of the Nationals front bench would follow. The rest of the shadow cabinet duly resigned. \"This process was wasn't all Sussan Ley's fault,\" Littleproud said. \"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese put her in this process. But it has been mismanaged by Sussan Ley.\"Ley had already been struggling to assert her authority over the Coalition after being elected the Liberal party's first female leader after last year's bruising election defeat.  Some political analysts and observers had predicted she would be ousted by the end of last year and Thursday's events have reignited those conversations.The Coalition, in its current form, dates back to the 1940s, and before the brief break-up last year, had not parted way since 1987.The Nationals mainly represent regional communities and often lean more conservative than the Liberals.On local radio, senior Nationals member Bridget McKenzie - who was one of the senators who went rogue - was asked: \"Why on earth are you playing leadership games today?\"\"I think the timing's appalling,\" McKenzie told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), but said the question was unfair.Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, himself no stranger to scuffles with the Nationals, told the ABC both Coalition party leaders had \"mismanaged\" the disagreement and now faced an un-electability crisis.\"It looks like just a smouldering wreckage, doesn't it?\" he said of the Coalition.Another former Liberal leader and one of the nation's longest serving prime ministers, John Howard, told The Australian Ley had had \"no choice\" after the Nationals senators' revolt and had \"behaved absolutely correctly\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoDonald Trump's announcement that he has reached an agreement with Nato allies on Greenland dominates Thursday's papers. The Times leads with the US president announcing a \"framework deal\" has been reached after talks with Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, saying it \"gives us everything we needed to get\".The Financial Times says the US president signalled there would be \"additional discussions\" on Greenland's role in the Golden Dome, a planned missile defence system to protect the US from all missile attacks.In light of the deal, the Guardian says Donald Trump is stepping back from his threat to impose tariffs on European allies who opposed his acquisition of Greenland.As a result of Donald Trump's climbdown from his tariff threat, markets in the US have rallied, with stocks surging back on Wednesday, reports the Daily Mail. Elsewhere, the paper continues to tease more details from the Beckham family row.\"It's a Don deal\" says the Daily Star, as it calls the Greenland saga \"manbaby mayhem\".Despite the easing of tensions, the i Paper quotes a senior Nato official warning that \"if we don't give Greenland to the US they will stop supporting Ukraine\".The Daily Telegraph fills its front page with a picture of a smiling Donald Trump in its coverage. Elsewhere, the paper highlights one of the US president's jibes at the audience during his speech at the World Economic Forum: \"You'd all be speaking German if it wasn't for us.\"The Independent follows with more details of the US president's speech in Davos, where he insisted the US must own Arctic territory in order for its national security. The paper sums up his remarks with the headline: \"All I want is a piece of ice.\" The Daily Mirror describes Donald Trump's Davos speech as a \"delusional rant\" during which he insisted that European leaders \"loved him\" before his Greenland ambitions. The paper also dubs him \"Daddy fool\", a play on the Boney M 1970s hit.Moving to news closer to home, the Daily Express reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been criticised by the Tories for costing the UK jobs after it emerged that pubs will face \"years of huge tax rises\". The party is accusing Reeves of \"shutting up shop\" in the nation's High Streets after the Treasury said tax relief to help landlords cope with increases to business rates will \"slowly unwind\" over the next three years.The Metro carries a report from an ongoing court case in London where a jury heard that a friend of Donald Trump's son Barron said he saved her life during an attack. The paper says the US president's youngest son called police after seeing his friend being assaulted by her former boyfriend during a FaceTime call.Finally, in the wake of Prue Leith stepping down as judge of The Great British Bake Off, the Sun reports that Nigella Lawson is a \"choux-in\" for her replacement.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Blue Origin, the rocket company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, says it will launch more than 5,400 satellites to create a new communications network.Named TeraWave, it will offer continuous internet access around the world, with the ability to move large amounts of data much more quickly than rival services.But even after launching thousands of satellites, Blue Origin would still have far fewer in orbit than Elon Musk's Starlink, which currently dominates the satellite internet market.Starlink - part of Musk's rocket firm SpaceX - also offers internet and phone services to individual customers, while Blue Origin says TeraWave will be focused on data centres, businesses and governments.Blue Origin said its network, at its fastest, would allow upload and download speeds of as much as 6 terabits per second, much faster than rival commercial satellite services currently offer.Another competitor to TeraWave is Amazon, the technology giant that made Bezos a multi-billionaire. He is still Amazon's executive chairman after stepping down in 2021 as its chief executive.Amazon's satellite venture is called Leo. While it currently has around 180 satellites in orbit, having launched dozens more just last week, it plans to have more than 3,000 in orbit.Like Starlink, Amazon is also more focused on the general public than businesses and governments, pitching Leo as a way to offer high-speed internet access globally. It has not said when all of the Leo satellites will be in orbit.Blue Origin said it will start launching its TeraWave satellites by the end of 2027.In November, the company successfully landed a rocket booster on a floating platform for the first time.Only SpaceX had previously accomplished this feat.In April, Blue Origin launched an 11-minute space flight with an all-female crew, including Bezos' now-wife Lauren Sánchez, singer Katie Perry and CBS presenter Gayle King.But some commentators said it was \"tone deaf\" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.",

    "body": "If Leonardo DiCaprio's Catch Me If You Can ever needed a sequel, prosecutors say real life may have already written one.A Canadian man, Dallas Pokornik, is accused of masquerading as both a pilot and a flight attendant, allegedly raking in hundreds of free flights over four years, US authorities said. Prosecutors allege the 33-year-old Toronto native created a fake employee identification card to receive free flights on US airlines - and at one point even asked to sit in the cockpit.Pokornik was arrested in Panama and extradited to the United States, where he now faces wire fraud charges.The BBC has contacted Pokornik's lawyer for comment. The scheme, outlined in court documents, bears striking similarities to the 2002  DiCaprio film in which a charming teenager running from the FBI impersonates a pilot to jet around the world.Prosecutors say Pokornik had previously worked legitimately as a flight attendant for a Canadian airline from 2017 to 2019, but was not employed by any airline at the time of the alleged fraud.In the years after Pokornik's employment on that airline, prosecutors allege that Pokornik used a fake badge defrauding three US airlines out of flights reserved for pilots and flight attendants. At one point, Pokornik requested to sit in a \"jump seat\" in a plane's cockpit, a spot reserved for off-duty pilots, despite not being a pilot or having an airman's certificate, prosecutors allege in court documents. But whether Pokornik ever actually did ride with the pilots on a flight is unclear. The US airlines are not named in the indictment but are identified as being headquartered in Honolulu, Chicago and Fort Worth, Texas. Though the indictment currently only covers a period from January through October 2024, prosecutors are aware of Pokornik's alleged misconduct over the course of four years, from January 2020 to October 2024, a justice department spokesperson told the BBC. If convicted, Pokornik faces up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, the Department of Justice said.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has agreed to testify under oath before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files.Committee chairman James Comer, who is leading the investigation, says Maxwell will depose virtually on 9 February. Maxwell's legal team has previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity. Comer, previewing the deposition, said, \"her lawyers have been saying she is going to plead the Fifth,\" referring to the US Fifth Amendment right to decline to speak to authorities.The announcement from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes as the Trump administration continues to face fierce scrutiny for its handling of the Epstein case.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking  teenage girls for sexual abuse by Epstein.  In July, the committee declined to offer Maxwell legal immunity in exchange for her testimony.In August, the committee issued legal summons to Maxwell, requiring her to submit evidence under oath. Maxwell's legal team said that requiring her to both testify from jail, and without any legal immunity, were \"non-starters\".The lawyers said she \"cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity\" as speaking from prison \"creates real security risks and undermines the integrity of the process\".House lawmakers cannot force Maxwell to waive her Fifth Amendment protections.On Tuesday, Maxwell's legal team said in a letter to the committee that she would continue to refuse to testify.\"Put plainly, proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater and a complete waste of taxpayer monies,\" the attorneys wrote. \"The Committee would obtain no testimony, no answers, and no new facts.\"Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021, had appealed against the conviction to the  Supreme Court last October but the top court declined to hear the former British socialite's appeal.Her only route to leave prison early would be a presidential pardon, unless she is able to persuade a federal judge in New York to vacate or amend her sentence. The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out.Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in its possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public.The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations.Meanwhile, the House committee is also meeting to discuss former President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton's refusal to appear before the panel to answer questions related to the investigation into Epstein.The committee has said it is considering filing contempt charges against the two.

    "body": "Oldest cave painting of red claw hand could rewrite human creativity timeline13 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentA stencilled outline of a hand found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi is the world's oldest known cave painting, researchers say.It shows a red outline of a hand whose fingers were reworked, researchers say, to create a claw-like motif which indicates an early leap in symbolic imagination.The painting has been dated to at least 67,800 years ago – around 1,100 years before the previous record, a controversial hand stencil in Spain.The find also strengthens the argument that our species, Homo sapiens, had reached the wider Australia–New Guinea landmass, known as Sahul, by around 15,000 years earlier than some researchers argue.Over the past decade, a series of discoveries on Sulawesi has overturned the old idea that art and abstract thinking in our species burst suddenly into life in Ice Age Europe and spread from there.Cave art is seen as a key marker of when humans began to think in truly abstract, symbolic ways – the kind of imagination that underpins language, religion and science.Early paintings and engravings show people not just reacting to the world, but representing it, sharing stories and identities in a way no other species is known to have done.Professor Adam Brumm of Griffiths University in Australia, who co-led the project, told BBC News, that the latest discovery, published in the journal Nature, adds to the emerging view that there was no awakening for humanity in Europe. Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.Ahdi Agus OktavianaMore recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoArchie MitchellBusiness reporterUS President Donald Trump's proposal to cap credit card costs would be \"an economic disaster\", the boss of one of the world's biggest banks has warned.JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon said the plan would remove credit from the majority of Americans and hit restaurants, retailers, travel firms and schools.Trump this month wrote on Truth Social that interest rates on credit cards should be limited to 10% for one year from 20 January.The cap has yet to come into force and the president did not say how it might be introduced or whether such a move would be legally enforceable.Asked about the cap at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Dimon said: \"It would be an economic disaster, and I'm not making that up because our business… we would survive it by the way.\"He said capping interest rates on credit cards at Trump's suggested level of 10% would be \"drastic\" and cut access to credit for 80% of Americans, adding that it is \"their back up credit\".In a dig at senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have supported such a cap, he said if Trump did go ahead with the plan, it should be trialled in their respective states of Vermont and Massachusetts.Dimon added: \"The people crying the most won't be the credit card companies, it will be the restaurants, the retailers, the travel companies, the schools, the municipalities because people will miss their water payments.\"Top JP Morgan executives including Dimon had previously warned that a 10% interest rate cap would severely hurt consumers, adding their voices to criticism of the proposal.Trump doubled down on his suggestion on Wednesday, telling the business news channel CNBC: \"I've had calls from credit card companies, people that are friends of mine, actually, and I treat them good.\"I respect them greatly, but they make a lot of money, they got to give people a break.\"US banking associations have said capping interest rates would make it harder for people to access credit and be \"devastating\" for millions of families and small businesses.The average interest rate for credit cards in the US is roughly 20%.In his statement on social media on 13 January, Trump called for a 10% limit, reviving an idea he put forward during his 2024 presidential election campaign.\"Effective January 20, 2026, I, as President of the United States, am calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%,\" he wrote. \"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"The social media post spooked investors in credit card firms American Express, Visa and Mastercard, while UK bank Barclays also saw its shares dip.",

    "body": "A powerful blast of cold air from the Arctic is expected to sweep through much of the United States, bringing snow and ice to nearly 30 states and affecting nearly 160 million people, forecasters warn.The cold front is expected to ramp up on Thursday in the southwest, before pushing into the East Coast over the weekend. Meteorologists say temperatures could plunge well below freezing in some areas as the frigid northern air, known as the Polar Vortex, settles over the country. Transportation officials, including airport authorities in several major cities, are warning travellers to brace for significant delays amid the severe winter weather.The weather system is expected to take shape in Texas and New Mexico before moving eastward, blanketing cities including Memphis, Nashville, Washington DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York with snow.Forecasters say states across the interior plains could see temperatures plunge to -40F (-40C) or even lower. Rocky Mountain states can expect to see large amounts of snowfall by Friday.While it remains too early to predict exact snowfall totals in urban areas, some places are expected to see over 12in (30cm), weather experts say. States further south may experience freezing rain, which could coat trees with ice and weigh them down, possibly leading to power outages. The National Weather Service (NWS) has warned that wind chills could reach well below average, creating conditions in which exposed skin could suffer frostbite within minutes.\"With the extreme cold temperatures, expect prolonged snow and ice impacts which may include hazardous travel conditions, power outages, tree damages, snow-covered roads, and reduced visibility,\" the NWS said in its forecast.Governors in several states, including Texas, North Carolina and South Carolina, have declared states of emergency, allowing emergency officials - including National Guard troops - to begin mobilising response efforts. \"Based on current forecasts, the State of Texas is acting to ensure Texans have the resources they need before severe winter weather impacts communities across Texas,\" Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement.The warnings come amid memories of the bitterly cold winter storm that struck Texas in 2021, causing the energy grid to fail and leaving millions of residents without power for several days.Officials caution the cold temperatures could again cause pipes to freeze and then burst. Roadways could also be blocked for days, especially in southern states with limited de-icing equipment.Cold temperatures are expected to persist into next week. ",

    "body": "4 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC NewsBBCNicky spent 10 years as a hostage negotiator for the Metropolitan PoliceBeing a parent and working as a hostage negotiator don't immediately appear to have a lot in common, but someone who has been both says tricks she learnt in her profession can help you at home.Nicky Perfect spent over 30 years as a Metropolitan Police officer, including 10 years as an international hostage and crisis negotiator, in the elite New Scotland Yard Hostage and Crisis Negotiation Unit.At times, she says, knowing what to do or say as a parent, can feel high-stakes - the difference between keeping the peace and a full-on meltdown or argument.Here are the three techniques from her high-pressure career which will help you stay calm and in control as a parent, she told the BBC's Parenting Download podcast, 1. Give them a 'no choice choice'Getty ImagesKids regularly push boundaries and often want to do the opposite of what you ask them.In situations like these rather than asserting your authority and using the \"because I said so\" phrase, try the \"no choice choice\", trick, says NIcky.This means reframing the situation by continuing to enforce one choice, but doing so in a manner that still gives your child a sense of control and influence. So, asking a child whether they want to put their coat on in the house or when they go outside, for example, can help them feel heard, respected and involved - all while leading to the same outcome.Another example could be giving a child that is refusing to eat vegetables the option between broccoli or sprouts.This may not work every time, but it can help limit immediate resistance.2. Wait 90 seconds before respondingGetty ImagesWhen dealing with sensitive topics, Nicky advises not responding for 90 seconds to  stop you responding emotionally.As an FBI agent once told her: \"your job in life is not to change people… you can't… the only thing you can choose is how to respond.\"It is important to remember this choice exists even when emotions threaten to overwhelm the logical side of our brain.\"The response might just be, 'do you know what? I'm being quite emotional now. I need to go away and think about this',\" says Nicky. \"Or it might be you just don't say anything, and you listen to what they've got to say.\"As a co-parent, she had to put this into practice herself when her stepdaughter admitted she wanted to spend Christmas Day with her dad and siblings after they moved further away.Internally, Nicky desperately wanted her to stay. But, she says, \"somewhere along the line you have to press the pause button... and say this is your Christmas. It's a day in my life. What do you want?\"Accepting this made it easier for her to decide how to spend the day herself - as well as plan a new way of celebrating together with her stepdaughter, either before or after.3. See their perspective Getty ImagesSeeing the world from the other person's point of view, be they big or small, is key, says Nicky.This way you can sell the benefits of your outcome to the other person, while also making them feel heard.\"It's called the 'power of' negotiation, because if you give people reasons why something should or shouldn't happen, they're more likely to accept it,\" says Nicky.\"It's about recognising it and being really honest with people. People are far more receptive to your honesty than you think they're going to be,\" she says.Take the common problem of tantrums over bedtime. Children can often struggle with the loss of autonomy that a sudden bedtime announcement brings.A solution, says Nicky, is to consider how the child feels in that moment, rather than view it as an adult.  If they're enjoying playing and then you suddenly say it's time to go to bed, this can feel abrupt and naturally upset them.Instead, her suggestion is to prepare the child as soon as they get home - weaving the night time routine naturally into the conversation and reinforcing it regularly throughout the evening. Something like \"we'll have dinner, then watch some TV and then it's bedtime\" acts as a good framework.The child then feels more involved and aware of what is coming, even if they don't necessarily like it - meaning hopefully fewer tantrums.",

    "body": "9 hours agoThomas MackintoshandRachel HaganThe US military has begun the transfer up to 7,000 Islamic State (IS) group detainees from prisons in north-eastern Syria to Iraq, as Syria's new government takes control of areas long run autonomously by Kurdish-led forces.US Central Command (Centcom) said it had already moved 150 IS fighters from Hassakeh province to a \"secure location\" in Iraq.It said the move aimed to prevent prisoners breaking out and regrouping.The transfer follows a ceasefire agreement that has brought much of Syria's north east under Damascus control, after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) withdrew from key areas, including detention sites holding thousands of IS suspects and their relatives.CENTCOM said its commander Admiral Brad Cooper discussed the transfers with Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, stressing the need for Syrian forces to uphold the ceasefire and avoid any action that could interfere with what he described as an \"orderly and secure transfer\" of detainees.Rights group Reprieve warned that detainees transferred to Iraq could face torture and execution and urged the UK government to establish whether any British nationals were among those being moved.The charity said it believed there were no more than 10 British men held in the prisons, though exact numbers were unclear. Around 55 to 60 British nationals, most of them children, remain detained across camps and prisons in the region, it said.Despite the ceasefire there have been fresh clashes, with Syria's defence ministry saying seven soldiers were killed in a drone attack in Hassakeh on Wednesday, describing the incident a violation of the ceasefire.The SDF denied carrying out the strike and accused Damascus of also launching attacks, including near the town of Kobane on the Turkish border.The government and SDF had earlier blamed each other over the escape of suspected IS fighters from an SDF-run prison in Shaddadi, in southern Hassakeh.Syria's interior ministry said on Monday night that its special forces and army soldiers had entered the town following \"the escape of around 120 [IS] terrorists\" from the prison. It said security forces later recaptured 81 of the fugitives.The SDF said it had lost control of the prison following clashes with \"Damascus-affiliated factions\", warning of a \"serious security catastrophe\".SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members may have escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency. The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is also holding IS members and leaders.The SDF helped US-led forces defeat IS during Syria's 13-year civil war and, backed by the US, went on to jail around 12,000 IS members, including thousands of foreigners, while detaining tens of thousands of relatives in camps across the north east.However US special envoy Tom Barrack has said the US alliance with the SDF had \"largely expired\" and that his country was currently focused on securing IS detention facilities and facilitating talks between the SDF and al-Sharaa's government.\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondentGetty ImagesWhat on earth has the last fortnight been all about?In the wake of a successful military operation in Venezuela earlier this month, a buoyed-up Donald Trump started to ratchet up the rhetoric on Greenland.Day after day, the world was treated to claims of ownership, threats of military action and tariffs against traditional allies in Europe.Now, in an apparent puff of smoke, it may all have gone.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, arguably the Trump whisperer-in-chief, seems to have talked the president down from his dangerously high hobby horse.Watch: Trump takes aim at world leaders in Davos speechThe ground may have been laid last week during a visit to Washington by the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. The visit concluded with agreement on a \"working group\" to discuss Greenland's future.But Rutte appears to have finessed an issue that had threatened to shatter the north Atlantic alliance.We don't yet know the details of the deal, but many will wonder why it needed a frenetic two-week crisis to get here.Denmark had long said that it was only too happy to see an increased American military presence on Greenland.If Nato has now pledged to up its presence on and around the island, then that will go some way towards reassuring Donald Trump that the alliance is finally paying proper attention to Greenland.The New York Times quotes anonymous officials as saying one idea under discussion is for Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases - similar to the arrangement by which the UK maintains sovereign bases on Cyprus.Watch: How was Trump's Davos speech received?Trump said the deal would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources.Neither Denmark nor Nato has confirmed these or any other reports.Nato said discussions would \"focus on ensuring Arctic security through the collective efforts, especially the seven Arctic Allies\" (the US, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland) and aimed to prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold, economic or military, in Greenland.It won't be long before details of the deal emerge. But the fact that Donald Trump triggered a fortnight of high drama and a sense of existential crisis within Nato to get here will not easily be forgotten.Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney called it a \"rupture\", saying the old order was \"not coming back.\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke of \"seismic change\" and urged greater European independence.It's hard to see a quick return to business as usual.",

    "body": "German nurse gets life in jail after murdering 10 to reduce workload2 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.Prosecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.The offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany. Investigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.According to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007. Prosecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\". The court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a muscle relaxant, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.He was arrested in 2024.When issuing the life sentence, the court said that the man's crimes carried a \"particular severity of guilt\" which should bar him from early release after 15 years.He will be able to appeal the verdict.Prosecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.The case bears similarity to that of former nurse Niels Högel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany. A court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.He is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germany's modern history.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesIf you've ever wanted to create your own computer program but never learnt how to code, you might try \"vibe coding\".Collins Dictionary's word of the year - which is confusingly made up of two words - is the art of making an app or website by describing it to artificial intelligence (AI) rather than by writing programming code manually.The term was coined in February by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, who came up with the name to represent how AI can let some programmers \"forget that the code even exists\" and \"give in to the vibes\" while making a computer program.It was one of 10 words on a shortlist to reflect the mood, language and preoccupations of 2025.By giving an AI tool a simple description such as \"make me a program that schedules my weekly meals\", people can use \"vibe coding\" to make basic apps without any previous programming knowledge.More complicated tools still require skill, but the practice has opened up creating digital platforms to non-coders.As many have discovered, it isn't perfect - with no guarantee the code will actually work or be free of bugs.Alex Beecroft, the Managing Director of Collins, said the term \"perfectly captures how language is evolving alongside technology\".'Clankers' and 'broligarchy'Not all the words necessarily first emerged in 2025 - but Collins decided this was the year they became popular.For example \"clanker\", a term used to describe robots in Star Wars games and movies since the mid 2000s, made the list after it went viral on TikTok in July as people shared their frustrations with AI-powered machines.While \"aura farming\" - people doing things for the sake of looking cool, often when they know they're being filmed - was first used in January 2024, but became increasingly popular over the course of 2025.And the portmanteau \"broligarchy\" took off in 2024 to describe the owners of the world's biggest technology companies and their purported political influence - and was used frequently in 2025 following the appearance of many of the bosses at US President Donald Trump's inauguration.The other definitions in the shortlist were:Biohacking, the activity of altering the natural processes of one's body in an attempt to improve one's health and longevityCoolcation, a holiday in a place with a cool climateGlaze, to praise or flatter someone excessively or undeservedlyHenry, acronym for \"high earner, not rich yet\", or a person who has not accrued substantial wealth from their high incomeMicro-retirement, a break taken between periods of employment in order to pursue personal interestsTaskmasking, the act of giving a false impression that one is being productive in the workplace",

    "body": "King handed Nvidia boss a letter warning of AI dangers5 hours agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorBBCJensen Huang, the head of the world's most valuable company Nvidia, says King Charles III personally handed him a copy of a speech he delivered in 2023 that included a warning about the dangers of artificial intelligence.\"He said, there's something I want to talk to you about. And he handed me a letter,\" Huang told the BBC, speaking after receiving the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering in a ceremony at St James's Palace.The letter was a copy of the speech delivered by the King in 2023 at the world's first AI Summit, held at Bletchley Park. In it the monarch said that the risks of AI needed to be tackled with \"a sense of urgency, unity and collective strength\".\"It was his speech on AI safety. He obviously cares very deeply about AI safety,\" Mr Huang said.Mr Huang said the King wrote in his speech that he believed in the \"incredible capability\" of the technology to transform the UK and the world.\"But he also wants to remind us that the technology could be used for good and for evil, and so to make sure we do everything we can to advance AI safety.\"In the King's address he describes the development of advanced AI as \"no less important than the discovery of electricity\".On Wednesday, Jensen Huang received the the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering alongside six other foundational figures in AI, including Professors Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who have warned that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity.But US president Donald Trump has urged the AI sector to make rapid rather than cautious advances in the technology, and the AI Safety Summit was rebranded the AI Action Summit earlier this year.Jensen Huang received the award along six other laureates - in the back row (L-R)  Yoshua Bengio; the King; Yan LeCunn; Geoffrey Hinton and front row, (L-R): Jensen Huang; Fei-Fei Li; Bill Dally; and John HopfieldSenator Howard Lutnick has discouraged the use of the word safety on the grounds that, \"It makes us sound like we're afraid\".Mr Huang's company, Nvidia, was valued at $5tn this week. It specialises in advanced computer chips including those which power AI.Mr Huang added that in his view the UK is in a good position to take advantage of what he described as \"an industrial revolution that's happening right now.\"\"It's your opportunity to grasp,\" he said.Large US tech firms including Nvidia are investing billions of dollars in building AI infrastructure in the UK, in the form of enormous data centres, which Jensen Huang has called \"AI factories\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoSeveral papers lead on the mistaken release of two prisoners from Wandsworth Prison in London. \"Not again\" is the Daily Mirror's assessment of the mishap, which occurred soon after sex offender Hadush Kebatu was wrongly freed from a prison in Essex. The blunders show that prisons are \"in chaos\", the paper writes.Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was \"grilled\" by MPs at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday over whether he knew of any more inmates that had been wrongly released, Metro leads. The paper reports that Lammy was told about at least one of the prisoners before PMQs, but instead \"castigated the state of the criminal justice system inherited from the Conservatives\" at the despatch box.The government was told to \"get a grip on the prison fiasco\" following the \"shocking\" release of the prisoners, the Daily Express writes. A \"major manhunt\" is under way to find 24-year-old Algerian national Brahim Kaddour-Cherif and 35-year-old William Smith. The hunt for the two men comes as police chiefs warn that Labour's \"soft-justice\" reforms will \"unleash a crimewave on the streets\", the Daily Mail reports. The \"unprecedented intervention\" was issued as the government \"was left reeling by another day of chaos in the creaking criminal justice system\", according to the paper. Lammy is \"absolutely outraged\" by the mistakes, which he says \"expose deeper flaws\" about the criminal justice system, the i Paper writes. The former security chief of Wandsworth Prison says: \"This is a prison in freefall\".Sex offender Kaddour-Cherif was free for six days before the error was spotted, according to the Times, which reports that Lammy has been \"snared\" by the latest prison blunder. The paper writes that the mistake happened because of a \"complete breakdown in communications\", and officials only realised the inmate was missing when he was due to appear in court and could not be found.During PMQs, Lammy \"refused multiple times to say whether any more prisoners had been released in error\", the Guardian reports. But Kaddour-Cherif's mistaken release was announced almost immediately after the \"bruising session\" of questioning ended. The paper's front page also features a photo of Zohran Mamdani, the winner of Tuesday's New York City mayoral election.\"Democratic cheer\" is the headline for the Financial Times, which writes that Mamdani's victory is a \"resounding snub to Trump\". Elsewhere, the paper features warnings from Nvidia boss Jensen Huang that China \"is going to win the AI race\" with the US.The Daily Telegraph leads on a new pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicle drivers set to be unveiled in the Budget. The paper also reports on whistleblower accusations that the BBC's coverage of transgender issues is subject to \"effective censorship\" by reporters who refuse to cover gender-critical stories. Asked by BBC News, a BBC spokesperson said: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully. We have taken a number of actions relating to our reporting of sex and gender including updating the news style guide and sharing new guidance, making our Social Affairs Editor responsible for this coverage, and where there have been concerns about particular stories, we have addressed them. We continually review our coverage to reflect developments such as the recent Supreme Court Ruling.\"In a Hollywood exclusive, the Sun leads on the \"acting return\" of the Duchess of Sussex, who this week filmed scenes for the movie Close Personal Friends eight years after announcing her retirement from the screen. A source tells the paper that \"this is a massive moment for Meghan\".Finally, the Daily Star reports that British troops based overseas will get free mobile use thanks to a \"Remembrance Day tribute\" from Vodafone. \"Call of duty\" is their headline.

It hasn't changed much over the past 10 years.\"It's the same concept, the same structure. What changes is the subjects and the elements we can put on.\"She said it was \"a little bit more controversial every year\".\"It's harder to decide what is appropriate, what the backlash is going to be, that bit is quite hard,\" she added.Chair of the bonfire society, Bill Cummings said: \"We hold everyone to account and we'll burn anyone, no matter how important.\"We torched an effigy of Liz Truss a few years ago and the lettuce on her shoulder wouldn't light, so we now have someone bearing it at the very front of our procession.\"The not-for-profit organisation has been celebrating Bonfire Night for nearly 100 years.The 11m effigy of Sir Keir will take centre stage on Saturday, alongside a giant Guy Fawkes.More on this story",

    "body": "2 hours agoYasmin Rufo and Michelle RobertsGetty ImagesHeadaches are something almost all of us deal with at some point.They can last from a couple of minutes to days and the pain can be sharp, dull, throbbing or stabbing and sometimes spread beyond your head to your scalp, face or even your neck.Dr Xand van Tulleken, who hosts the BBC's What's Up Docs wellness podcast, knows the feeling all too well and says he gets headaches once a month or every six weeks and it \"feels like someone's drilling into my eyeball\".While it's easy to panic about what might be behind a bad headache, Dr Katy Munro, a GP and expert at the National Migraine Centre, says it's rarely something serious.\"It's natural to worry that something is seriously wrong, but the chances of that are actually very small,\" she explains.She advises that if it's your \"first or worst headache, get it checked out by a doctor,\"  but if you're getting a pattern of milder, recurring headaches, there are a few simple things you can try at home as well as seeing your GP.1. How big was the impact on your day?Dr Xand says understanding your own headaches can be surprisingly helpful as they  often don't have a single cause so keeping a diary can help you spot patterns and triggers.For some people, weather such as thunder and lightning could trigger it, while for others it might be sensitivity to light.\"The worst time for me is when we're driving in the autumn and the sun is low and the sun is flickering through the trees...it really aggravates,\" says Dr Munro.It's worth noting down things like:What you were doing when the headache startedWhat you ate or drankHow well you sleptThe weatherFor women, track your menstrual cycle, as headaches can be linked to hormonal changesBut, Dr Munro cautions that you shouldn't overdo it.\"I made the mistake of making mine very detailed, which was depressing. Instead keep it simple and maybe write a number from one to 10 to summarise the impact it had on your day.\"It's also useful to track how many crystal-clear days you have, not just the bad ones.Your doctor can then review it to help identify patterns.2. Use caffeine wisely You might think that caffeine is something you should instantly avoid if you have a headache but Dr Munro says the truth is more nuanced. In small, careful doses, it can make painkillers more effective if you are not having too much caffeine on a daily basis.\"Caffeine is a co-analgesic which means it can boost the effect of a painkiller,\" Dr Munro explains, but avoid it in the afternoon and evening as it can disrupt your sleep.It's worth also thinking about your caffeine consumption more broadly - consuming lots of it every day can cause a caffeine overuse headache and if you suddenly stop, you might get a withdrawal headache.3.  Don't skip mealsWhat you eat and when may make a difference if you're suffering from headaches.Dr Munro recommends following a diet similar to the Mediterranean one that is rich in protein, healthy fats and complex carbs which can help stabilise your energy levels.You should avoid quick-release sugary snacks and definitely don't skip meals as that can be a common trigger.Dr Munro says she found her headaches were helped by cutting out dairy and gluten, though that's not universal.\"I also found eating regularly and taking lunch to work made a difference,\" she says.As well as thinking about food, Dr Munro says regular exercise, good sleep, stress management and staying hydrated can also help reduce headaches.You should drink enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour and you don't feel thirsty. 4. Avoid painkillers with codeine\"There are lots of things, like painkillers or anti-nausea tablets, you can buy over the counter that may be helpful to manage headaches\" says Dr Munro.She cautions that you should avoid \"anything containing codeine\" as it can make some headaches occur more frequently and can worsen symptoms like nausea. \"Painkillers can work extremely well but it does depend on how severe your headache is.\"If they're becoming more frequent or intense, your GP can help you find a more suitable medication.\"Make sure you don't regularly take painkillers on more than two days a week as this will reduce your risk of rebound headaches.Drs Chris and Xand van Tulleken are on a mission to help us take better care of ourselves.

    "body": "Several contestants have walked out of a Miss Universe event after an official from host nation Thailand publicly berated Miss Mexico in a tense confrontation. At a pre-pageant ceremony, Miss Universe Thailand director Nawat Itsaragrisil told off Fatima Bosch in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity.Video of the incident, which was live streamed, has been shared online. The Miss Universe Organisation (MUO) has condemned Mr Nawat's \"malicious\" behaviour, for which he has since apologised.The Miss Universe contestants, who are the winners of national pageants in their home countries, attended Tuesday's event in their sashes and gowns.Some can be heard shouting back at Mr Nawat in the video, after he raises his voice to reprimand Ms Bosch and repeatedly tells her to stop talking. As many of them stand to show support, Mr Nawat says: \"If anyone wants to continue the contest, sit down. If you step out, the rest of the girls continue.\"Despite this, the majority of the women in the video appear standing, with several heading towards the door.After leaving the event on Tuesday, Ms Bosch told the press the 60-year-old executive was \"not respectful\" and said he had called her \"dumb\". Mr Nawat has disputed this, claiming his words had been misunderstood. He is widely reported to have called the 25-year-old a \"dumbhead\". But at a press conference he later claimed he was saying she had caused \"damage\".His conduct prompted a stern rebuke from the MUO, which has sent a delegation of international executives to take over running the competition.In a video statement, MUO President Raul Rocha said Mr Nawat had \"forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host\". He said the Thai official had \"humiliated, insulted and showed a lack of respect\" to Ms Bosch, and committed the \"serious abuse of having called security to intimidate a defenceless woman\".Mr Nawat's participation in the pageant would be limited \"as much as possible\" or eliminated entirely, he said, adding the MUO would be taking \"legal actions\" against him.\"I wish to reiterate that Miss Universe is an empowerment platform for women so that their voices can be heard in the world,\" Mr Rocha said.Among those to walk out on Tuesday was reigning Miss Universe Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark. \"This is about women's rights,\" she said as she left the event. \"This is not how things should be handled. To trash another girl is beyond disrespectful... That's why I'm taking my coat and I'm walking out.\"Ms Bosch later said in an interview: \"I just want to let my country know, I'm not afraid to make my voice heard. It's here stronger than ever. I have a purpose. I have things to say.\"We're in the 21st century. I'm not a doll to be made up, styled and have my clothes changed,\" she added. \"I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I'm completely committed to that.\"Video of Mr Nawat has outraged fans of the pageant, with many heavily criticising his actions and praising Ms Bosch's response.In a social media video statement, Mr Nawat said: \"If anyone feels bad, uncomfortable, or affected, I apologise to everyone. I especially apologised to the girls who were present, around 75 of them.\"The Miss Universe competition has pressed on despite this controversy, with contestants taking part in a welcome event in Bangkok on Wednesday.The winner will be crowned the new Miss Universe on 21 November.",

    "body": "MSPs pass land reform which could force break up of huge estates9 hours agoAngus CochraneBBC ScotlandGetty ImagesThe government wants to change the way land is managed in Scotland The Scottish Parliament has passed land reforms which could force the break-up of some large estates.The bill is designed to help reduce the concentration of rural land ownership among a small number of people, and to give communities a greater say in what happens on privately owned land.It also seeks to increase opportunities for community buyouts of land and could allow for large estates to be split into smaller plots when they are put up for sale. After three days of debates, with almost 400 amendments lodged, the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was passed with 85 supporting, 28 in opposition and nine abstaining.About half of Scotland's land is owned by just 420 people, according to research by former Green MSP Andy Wightman. The government said its reforms would help address that imbalance.Land reform campaigners welcomed some aspects of the bill, but said it did not go far enough. Opponents warned the wide-ranging legislation would not work in practice and argued against government intervention in land transactions. What is in the land reform bill?The parliament backed the creation of a \"transfer test\", which would ensure that the sale or transfer of a large landholding (bigger than 1,000 hectares) cannot be completed without owners first applying to ministers for a decision on whether to sub-divide the land into \"lots\".The bill also says that if someone wants to sell a large landholding, they must notify the government. Ministers would in turn notify community groups, offering them the chance to buy the land. The legislation will compel owners of large landholdings to tell the surrounding community more about what happens on their land by publishing a land management plan. A failure to comply with this requirement could result in a fine of up to £40,000.The legislation will also pave the way for the creation of a Land and Communities Commissioner to oversee, investigate and report on some of the bill's key aims. Getty ImagesRural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon steered the bill through parliamentPatrick Colquhoun, assistant chief executive of Luss Estates, which owns almost 50,000 acres of land around Loch Lomond, said the legislation could lead to an \"infringement\" on property rights.Mr Colquhoun, who is also vice-chairman of Scottish Land and Estates, told the BBC's Scotcast podcast that he feared the definition of a large landholding could be reduced in future.\"Already the government are being pressed to reduce that down to 500 (hectares), then it's 200, then it's 10, then it's five and suddenly your plot at home, your garden ground could be under threat,\" he said. Some lawyers have also raised concerns. Don Macleod, head of land and property at law firm Turcan Connell, described the bill as \"junk\", arguing that ambiguity over the definition of a large landholding could make the law \"unworkable and impossible\".Community Land Scotland, which represents community landowners, said the bill was a \"step forward\" for land reform.However, it warned that the measures did not \"go far enough to meaningfully intervene in the land market and change landownership patterns\". 'Lack of ambition' Rural Affairs Secretary Mairi Gougeon told MSPs the reforms would improve how land is owned and managed for the benefit \"of the many, not the few\". She told MSPs would allow communities to \"breathe new life into rural communities\". Addressing concerns that the bill was not sufficiently radical, she said the reforms were \"balanced and proportionate\". Scottish Conservative rural affairs spokesperson Tim Eagle described the bill as \"unworkable and devastating\", arguing it would \"damage rural businesses and reduce the land available for rent\".Other parties argued the reforms did not go far enough.  Scottish Labour rural affairs spokeswoman Rhoda Grant said: \"We support any improvements to Scotland's land management, but this weak bill is largely tinkering around the edges.\"The only significant change is to introduce untested lotting provisions and to take steps to stop off-market sales.\" Green rural affairs spokesperson Ariane Burgess said ministers had shown a \"lack of ambition to deliver the real land reform that is so vital\".

    "body": "5 hours agoBecky Morton,Political reporter, Sima Kotecha,Senior UK correspondent and Chris Mason,Political editorMet PoliceThe Met Police have released image of two men who were mistakenly released from Wandsworth Prison -  24-year-old Brahim Kaddour-Cherif and 35-year-old William SmithPolice are searching for two prisoners separately released in error from a London prison in the past week.Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, an Algerian man, who is a sex offender, was let out of Wandsworth Prison by mistake on 29 October.Convicted fraudster William Smith was released in error days later on 3 November. This comes just weeks after migrant sex offender Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was  mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford in Essex.It leaves Justice Secretary David Lammy under fire, after he had promised to put in place extra checks to prevent similar cases after Kebatu's release.During Prime Minister's Questions, Lammy, who was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer, was repeatedly asked whether any asylum-seeking offender had been accidentally let out of prison since Kebatu was released but he refused to answer.As PMQs was ending, the Met Police released a statement revealing a foreign prisoner had been released by mistake last Wednesday, with the force informed on Tuesday.The police later confirmed the man was 24-year-old Kaddour-Cherif and they believed he had links to Tower Hamlets and Westminster in London. The Met police said in a statement about the manhunt that he was convicted in November 2024 of indecent exposure relating to an incident in March that year. He was sentenced to an 18 month community order and placed on the sex offenders' register for five years.The BBC has been told he is not an asylum seeker and that Lammy was informed overnight about the accidental release.Kaddour-Cherif is understood to have entered the UK legally on a visit visa in 2019 but overstayed his visa with a \"probable over-stayer\" case created in 2020.At Prime Minister's Questions, shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge, deputising for Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, repeatedly asked the same question which Lammy did not answer and instead attacked the Conservative government's record in office on prisons.Later, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"On entering the House [of Commons], facts were still emerging about the case and the deputy prime minister had not been accurately informed of key details including the offender's immigration status.\"The DPM waited until after PMQs and further facts had emerged before making a statement.\"Met police footage shows Brahim Kaddour-Cherif arrest in SeptemberAfter the Met Police announced the mistaken release of Kaddour-Cherif, Lammy put out a statement in which he said he was \"absolutely outraged and appalled\".\"Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers. \"That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases which has persisted for too long.\"Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"It is shocking that once again the Labour government has mistakenly allowed a foreign criminal to be released from prison.\"\"This makes a mockery of Lammy's claims at PMQs to have introduced the 'strongest checks ever' on release.\"The Liberal Democrats' justice spokesperson Jess Brown-Fuller called for \"a full explanation about how this has happened again\".Reform UK said it was \"seriously concerned that the deputy prime minister inadvertently misled\" the House of Commons.Andrew Slaughter, Labour MP and chair of Parliament's Justice Committee, said the prison system had been \"starved of investment\" and faced \"overcrowding and understaffing within a decaying prison estate characterised by chaos and instability\".Watch: The moment the Commons hears that second imprisoned migrant mistakenly freed from prisonHours after the Met Police's announcement, Surrey Police said another man - William Smith - had also been released in error from Wandsworth Prison in the past week.In a Facebook post, Surrey Police said Smith had been sentenced to 45 months for \"multiple fraud offences\" on Monday but had been released later the same day. The BBC understands that Smith was mistakenly recorded as receiving a suspended sentence rather than a custodial one.The error was corrected by the court but the amendment was sent to the wrong person.Smith is described as white, bald and clean-shaven, police say, adding: \"Smith was last seen wearing a navy long sleeve jumper with the Nike brand 'tick' across the front in white, navy blue tracksuit bottoms with a Nike 'tick' in white on the left pocket, and black trainers.\"The police urged the public get in touch if they had any information.Some 262 prisoners in England and Wales were mistakenly released in the year to March 2025, according to the latest figures, up 128% from 115 the previous year.Staff at HMP Wandsworth told the BBC the prison has been in a state of panic after the accidental release.Security has been a major concern at the prison for some time. An inspection report last year found chaos on the wings, with staff across most units unable to confirm where all their prisoners were during the working day.In 2023 Daniel Khalife escaped from HMP Wandsworth while awaiting trial for spying for Iran.",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorLast week, after a migrant sex offender was mistakenly released from prison, Justice Secretary David Lammy said he was implementing the \"strongest release checks that have ever been in place\".However, since then, details have emerged of two more prisoners being wrongly let out.It is always perilous for a government when it clearly lacks grip on an issue voters would reasonably expect it to be in control of.The stand out example of this in recent years has been the arrival of migrants on small boats.From Rishi Sunak's promise to \"stop the boats\" to Sir Keir Starmer's promise to \"smash the gangs\" both have been found wanting and the problem remains huge.Now the government confronts another example: a justice system that is palpably, transparently and repeatedly failing – and where measures designed to address the issue of letting prisoners out by accident aren't working.According to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March of this year - a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.In other words, it has been a problem for some time, and it is getting worse.And, context is everything in politics: this row now comes after the mistaken release of perhaps the most high-profile prisoner jailed this year.Hadush Kebatu, who arrived in the UK on a small boat, was jailed after sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman while living in an asylum hotel in Epping in Essex, only to be let out by accident. He has since been deported.It gave the issue of accidental releases from prison a salience and prominence it hadn't had until then.Once again, we are seeing ministers use the language we usually see from opposition politicians.The Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described the number of people arriving on small boats as \"shameful\".Now, the Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy is saying he is \"absolutely outraged\" over the mistaken release a week ago of Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, a 24-year-old Algerian sex offender.Lammy added that his officials have been \"working through the night to take him back to prison.\"Which brings us to the messy genesis of this saga, at B-Team Prime Minister's Question Time on Wednesday lunchtime.With the prime minister at the COP climate summit in Brazil, it was his deputy who was answering questions.The Conservatives put up the shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge, who repeated a question, using a very particular form of words, over and over again.He wanted to know if an \"asylum-seeking offender had been accidentally released from prison\".It was obvious from the Press Gallery that Cartlidge was on to something – because of the apparent precision of his language and his constant repetition of the question.But Lammy chose to repeatedly duck the question, despite, we later learnt, knowing about the case Cartlidge was referring to.So why didn't he address it?It turns out Cartlidge had got his facts wrong - Kaddour-Cherif isn't an asylum seeker. He arrived here legally but then stayed after his visa expired.Lammy wasn't certain on entering the chamber whether he was an asylum seeker or not.So setting out what he knew might also have exposed what he didn't.His team insist \"it is incredibly important to know the facts\" and they argue it was for the police in the first instance to do that publicly.Really? It seems reasonable to ask both whether Lammy could or should have known more when he arrived in the chamber and whether he could or should have disclosed more when he was there.The Conservatives later called for him to return to the Commons to set out what he knew. The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith suggested he may have misled the Commons. The Liberal Democrats and Reform have been very critical too.Some also suggest Lammy's manner – shouting \"get a grip, man!\" at Cartlidge, among other things – was a mistake.Could he instead have chosen to set out what he did and didn't know about the case at the beginning of the exchanges, before he took any questions?But it is the bigger picture here that really matters: the justice system is currently repeatedly failing in that most basic of its tasks – who should be in prison and who shouldn't.The reasons for that are complex – with difficult questions for the courts, individual prisons, the Prison Service, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office.It is not a new problem, but it is a growing one, and one the government doesn't have a grip on. And that, if you are the justice secretary, is a problem.",

    "body": "In pictures: Wednesday's Beaver supermoon captured around the world8 hours agoGeorge BurkeBBC NewsHuseyin Demirci / Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople around the world have been able to catch a glimpse of the Beaver supermoon as it rose on Wednesday.The largest, brightest Moon of the year has been shining in all its glory in the areas lucky enough to have a clear sky. Wednesday's supermoon is bigger and brighter than earlier supermoons this year due to the fact that it is the closest full Moon to Earth.This happens because the Moon does not orbit the Earth in a perfect circle - its axis of orbit more closely resembles an oval.The name Beaver Moon follows a longstanding tradition of nicknaming supermoons. While there is some disagreement as to the origins of the name, some sources attribute it to First Nations tribes in North America historically setting beaver traps in November.The last supermoon of the year will follow this month's Beaver Moon, taking place on 4 December.Photographers across the globe have been sharing their photos while out and about capturing the supermoon.Tatan Syuflana / APPeople could get a good look at the supermoon in Jakarta, Indonesia thanks to the planetarium providing telescopesCostfoto/NurPhoto via Getty ImagesFreight ships provided an atmospheric view of the supermoon over the Huai'an City skyline in Jiangsu Province, ChinaHollie Adams / ReutersA spectacular view of the Beaver supermoon amazed crowds of onlookers in North Bondi in Sydney, AustraliaNeil Hall / EPAPhotographer Neil Hall captured a clean, clear image of the Moon as it shone over London, despite some cloudy weatherJulian Stratenschulte / DPA via APJulian Stratenschulte positioned the Moon alongside the Torchbearer statue while photographing in Hannover, GermanyDawoud Abu Alkas / ReutersThe moonrise was clearly visible as it made an appearance in Gaza CityMarina Lystseva / ReutersThe Beaver Moon could be seen poking through cloud cover behind the Kremlin and St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, RussiaAlberto Pizzoli / AFP via Getty ImagesBirds could be seen flying over the city of Rome, Italy as the Moon shone a bright orangeIbraheem Abu Mustafa / ReutersA musician plays the saxophone as the Moon rises over the Qatar Boat Show 2025 in Doha, QatarOmar Haj Kadour / AFP via Getty ImagesA turning wheel provided a dazzling foreground to a photo of the Moon over the northern Syrian city of IdlibMustafa Yalcin / Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe moonrise was partially obscured by a dull haze hanging over the city of Paris, though still visible through the cloudsHarish Tyagi / EPAVivid street lights provided a playful scene for the Moon's rise in Delhi, IndiaSuhaimi Abdullah / NurPhoto via Getty ImagesAn abstract view of a street lamp is contrasted against the Moon's glare in SingaporeKostas Pikoulas / NurPhoto via Getty ImagesThe moonrise could be seen through foliage in Limassol, Cyprus Michael Bradley / AFP via Getty ImagesThose attending the Twenty20 cricket match at Eden Park were treated to a clear view of the Moon in Auckland, New ZealandTop image shows a man tending to his horse against the moonrise as the beaver supermoon appears in Sarikamis, Turkey",

    "body": "7 hours agoRobbie Kalus,in St Ives and Phil Shepka,CambridgeshireDave Scott said he drove at the alleged attackerA father has told how he used his car to hit a man suspected of stabbing 10 people on a train.Dave Scott, 57, was waiting to collect his daughter at Huntingdon railway station in Cambridgeshire on Saturday evening when a man holding a knife tried to get in his car.He said: \"It was a case of fight or flight, and I just powered away as quick as I could, also taking him with [me].\"Soon after Mr Scott's intervention, police officers arrested the man, British Transport Police confirmed. Anthony Williams, 32, has been charged with attempting to murder 10 people on board a train.Passengers on the 18:25 GMT Doncaster to London King's Cross LNER service were attacked shortly after the train left Peterborough.It was diverted to Huntingdon - an unscheduled stop - where Mr Scott was waiting  in the car park.He said he saw people running along the platform, which he initially thought was \"just a bunch of teenagers who'd been pratting around\".He then witnessed more people fleeing the station before seeing \"a large male\". PA MediaDave Scott's car was inside the police cordon and remained at Huntingdon station on Tuesday\"He was under the light at the time so it sort of shadowed him out and he was just heading straight for me. At that point I could see he had a knife in his hand,\" said Mr Scott.\"He came straight to my car and, if I remember rightly, he tried the door, couldn't get in and he started chopping down on the top of my car.\"Mr Scott drove off and spun his BMW around \"thinking that if I can I was probably going to hit him again if he was up or not, but at that point the police just appeared from everywhere\".He said he was yards away from where police made the arrest, and he left his car in position lighting up the area so officers could see better.After the arrest Mr Scott, from nearby St Ives, said the \"adrenaline was still pumping\", and when he phoned his daughter Helena, it was a \"massive relief\" to learn she was not on that train.Her train had been stopped elsewhere in Cambridgeshire and they made alternative arrangements to get her home.On Tuesday, British Transport Police, which is leading the investigation, said rail worker Samir Zitouni was still \"critically unwell\" in hospital.Rail operator LNER has described his actions as \"nothing short of heroic\", after he reportedly protected a girl from being stabbed. Three other people remain in hospital.CCTVThe BBC has obtained an image of Anthony Williams in Peterborough on FridayMr Williams, of no fixed abode, appeared at Peterborough Magistrates' Court on Monday and was remanded until the next court date on 1 December.As well as being charged in relation to Saturday's incident, he is also accused of carrying out a knife attack earlier in the day on another train in east London.Cambridgeshire Police is also reviewing three other knife-related incidents being investigated for possible links to Mr Williams, including an alleged attack on a 14-year-old boy.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoTom EdgingtonBBC Verify, Washington DCGetty ImagesPresident Donald Trump was swept to power for a second time on the back of a central campaign promise to tackle inflation.The steep rise in the cost of living was top of voters' minds and Trump blamed President Joe Biden.He also made sweeping promises to bring down prices for Americans \"starting on day one\".One year on from his victory, BBC Verify revisits some of the president's claims.Groceries\"When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One,\" Trump declared at an August 2024 news conference surrounded by packaged foods, milk, meats and eggs.Official data - which includes a four-month period when Biden was still president - shows grocery prices rose by 2.7% in the 12 months to September 2025, with some items seeing significantly sharper increases:Coffee: 18.9%Ground beef (minced beef): 12.9%Bananas: 6.9%Since Trump took office in January, the data also shows that apart from one recorded fall in April, grocery prices have risen each month.\"The president of the United States has very little control over the price of food, especially in the short term,\" food economics expert Professor David Ortega told BBC Verify.Trump's tariffs are driving up prices of certain foods, he said - a third of coffee  consumed in the US comes from Brazil and therefore has a 50% tariff.Trump's illegal immigration crackdown may also have had an impact, Ortega adds, especially in farming where as many as 40% of workers are estimated to be undocumented, which is close to a million people.\"As you know, farmers and companies have to raise wages in order to attract more labour. But trying to quantify those impacts in terms of price increase is almost impossible at the moment.\"Diane Swonk, the chief economist for KPMG, believes tariff and immigration policy changes have contributed to higher costs.\"There's no question that those shifts are now starting to show up as inflation pressures,\" she said.But she adds that other factors, including weather events, have contributed.\"On coffee you had climate issues for a very bad growing season and that was exacerbated by a tariff on Brazil and also Colombia,\" she said.Getty ImagesA White House official told BBC Verify President Trump did not control weather patterns in South America and coffee prices hikes were a global phenomenon.Data that tracks the cost of coffee shows prices have risen globally, peaking in February, but are now falling.The same official said the president was addressing rising beef prices by temporarily increasing imports.While grocery prices are up overall, not every item has become more expensive.When Trump succeeded Biden in January, the price of a dozen large eggs was $4.93 (£3.79), rising to a record high of $6.23 (£4.78) in March following bird flu outbreaks.Since then prices have fallen to $3.49 (£2.68) a dozen.\"President Trump's supply-side policies are taming Joe Biden's inflation crisis,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said.Other items that have fallen in price over the past 12 months include: butter and margarine (-2%), ice cream (-0.7%) and frozen vegetables (-0.7%).ElectricityDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to cut electricity bills sharply.\"Under my administration we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,\" he told a rally in August 2024.Since he became president, prices have risen.The latest figures show average residential electricity rates reached 17.62 cents per kWh (kilowatt hour) in August 2025 - up from 15.94 cents per kWh in January 2025, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\"It was technically impossible [to halve prices] at the time he made the promise,\" according to Professor James Sweeney from the Stanford Precourt Institute for Energy.Electricity prices not only reflect the cost of generation but also the expense of delivering it through \"the wires and the transformers and everything else\", he explained.Prof Sweeney attributes the increase to both demand and supply issues.\"We have a surge in demand mostly driven by data centres. People creating images using artificial intelligence are using significant amounts of electricity.\"Getty ImagesProf Sweeney says there has been a surge in demand for electricity mostly driven by data centres.He added that cuts to renewable energy subsidies and tariffs on imported steel - which raise the cost of building new power generators - have also pushed up prices.Swonk agreed that the AI boom is pushing up prices, especially for those on lower incomes.\"It exacerbates inequality because consumers that have more access to solar panels and renewables tend to be wealthier households,\" she said.In response a White House official said that Trump was expanding coal, natural gas and nuclear power, which was \"the only viable way to meet the growing energy demand and to lower energy prices\".CarsAt a campaign rally in September 2024, Trump extended his grocery pledge to cars, telling supporters: \"We're going to get the prices down… groceries, cars, everything\".However, the average price of a new car topped $50,000 (£38,411) for the first time ever in September, up from $48,283 (£37,092) in January according to Kelley Blue Book, a US vehicle valuation research company.Car prices typically rise 2-3% a year, explained Erin Keating from Cox Automotive.\"Tariffs, which have been the biggest factor in the automotive industry over the last 12 months, have been nothing but inflationary.\"She explained new car prices are increasing by about 4% a year, with tariffs contributing at least one percentage point.\"We really think in 2026 that's going to go higher because most of the manufacturers are holding their fire on raising prices directly due to tariffs, but they're going to have to come in at some point.\"Keating did point to tax breaks for people in Trump's spending bill, which she believes may incentivise people to buy new cars.When asked about the rising price of cars, a White House official told BBC Verify the administration had taken historic regulatory actions to \"reverse the left's radical energy scam and save billions annually\".Getty ImagesA White House official said the administration had taken historic regulatory actions to \"save billions annually\".Gasoline",

    "body": "10 hours agoLucy WilliamsonMiddle East correspondent, GazaWatch: BBC's Lucy Williamson taken to east of Gaza City in IDF-led visitFrom an embankment overlooking Gaza City, there's no hiding what this war has done.The Gaza of maps and memories is gone, replaced by a monochrome landscape of rubble stretching flat and still for 180 degrees, from Beit Hanoun on one side to Gaza City on the other.Beyond the distant shapes of buildings still standing inside Gaza City, there's almost nothing left to orient you here, or identify the neighbourhoods that once held tens of thousands of people.This was one of the first areas Israeli ground troops entered in the early weeks of the war. Since then they have been back multiple times, as Hamas regrouped around its strongholds in the area.Israel does not allow news organisations to report independently from Gaza. Today it took a group of journalists, including the BBC, into the area of the Strip occupied by Israeli forces. The brief visit was highly controlled and offered no access to Palestinians, or other areas of Gaza.Military censorship laws in Israel mean that military personnel were shown our material before publication. The BBC maintained editorial control of this report at all times.The remains of Shejaiya, an eastern neighbourhood of Gaza CityAsked about the level of destruction in the area we visited, Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani said it was \"not a goal\".\"The goal is to combat terrorists. Almost every house had a tunnel shaft or was booby-trapped or had an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade] or sniper station,\" he said. \"If you're driving fast, within a minute you can be inside of a living room of an Israeli grandmother or child. That's what happened on October 7.\"More than 1,100 people were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, and 251 others taken hostage.Since then, more than 68,000 Gazans have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there.The bodies of several hostages had been found in this area, Lt Col Shoshani said, including that of Itay Chen, returned to Israel by Hamas this week. Searches are continuing for the missing bodies of another seven hostages.The Israeli military base we travelled to is a few hundred metres from the yellow line – the temporary boundary set out in US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which divides the areas of Gaza still controlled by Israeli forces from the areas controlled by Hamas.Israel's army has been gradually marking out the yellow line with blocks on the ground, as a warning to both Hamas fighters and civilians. There are no demarcations along this part of the line yet - a soldier points it out to me, taking bearings from a small patch of sand between the grey crumbs of demolished buildings.EPAHamas fighters pictured on Wednesday in Gaza City (image brightened for clarity)The ceasefire is almost a month old, but Israeli forces say they are still fighting Hamas gunmen along the yellow line \"almost every day\". The piles of bronze-coloured bullet casings mark the firing points on the embankments facing Gaza City.Hamas has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire \"hundreds of times\", and Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry says more than 240 people have been killed as a result.Col Shoshani said that Israeli forces were committed to the US-led peace plan, but that they would also make sure that Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israeli civilians, and would stay as long as necessary.\"It's very clear to everyone that Hamas is armed and trying to control Gaza,\" he said. \"This is something that will be worked out, but we're far from that.\"Moose Campbell/ BBCBuildings in Gaza City have been reduced to grey, dusty rubble (image brightened for clarity)The next stage of the US-led plan requires Hamas to disarm and hand over power to a Palestinian committee overseen by international figures including President Trump.But rather than give up its power and weapons, Col Shoshani said, Hamas was doing the opposite.\"Hamas is trying to arm itself, trying to assert dominance, assert control over Gaza,\" he told me. \"It's killing people in broad daylight, to terrorise civilians and make sure they understand who is boss in Gaza. We hope this agreement is enough pressure to make sure Hamas disarms.\"Israeli forces showed us a map of the tunnels they said that soldiers had found beneath the rubble we saw – \"a vast network of tunnels, almost like spider's web\" they said – some already destroyed, some still intact, and some they were still searching for.What happens in the next stage of this peace deal is unclear.The agreement has left Gaza in a tense limbo. Washington knows how fragile the situation is - the ceasefire has faltered twice already.The US is pushing hard to move on from this volatile stand-off to a more durable peace. It has sent a draft resolution to UN Security Council members, seen by the BBC, which outlines a two-year mandate for an international stabilisation force to take over Gaza's security and disarm Hamas.But details of this next stage of the deal are thin: it's not clear which countries would send troops to secure Gaza ahead of Hamas disarmament, when Israel's troops will withdraw, or how the members of Gaza's new technocratic administration will be appointed.President Trump has outlined his vision of Gaza as a futuristic Middle Eastern hub, built with foreign investment. It's a far cry from where Gaza is today.Largely destroyed by Israel, and seen as an investment by Trump, the question is not just who can stop the fighting, but how much say Gazans will have in the future of their communities and lands.More on the Israel-Gaza war",

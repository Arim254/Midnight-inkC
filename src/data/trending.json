The Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control (DGCCRF) said the online description and categorisation of the dolls \"makes it difficult to doubt the child pornography nature of the content\".Shein later told the BBC: \"The products in question were immediately delisted as soon as we became aware of these serious issues.\"It said its team was \"investigating how these listings circumvented our screening measures\". Shein is also \"conducting a comprehensive review to identify and remove any similar items that may be listed on our marketplace by other third-party vendors\".The DGCCRF has reported Shein to French prosecutors as well as Arcom, the country's online and broadcasting regulator, according to French media.The news has emerged just days before Shein is set to open its first permanent physical shop anywhere in the world - in a Parisian department store.",

    "body": "The Kenyan government has confirmed that 21 people have died following a landslide in the western part of the country after heavy rainfall. Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said the bodies had been transferred to a nearby airstrip after the landslide in Marakwet East late on Friday night.He said on X that more than 30 people were still unaccounted for after being reported missing by their families while 25 people with serious injuries had been airlifted to receive further medical attention.The Kenyan Red Cross, which is helping to coordinate rescue efforts, said that the most affected areas are still not accessible by road due to mudslides and flash flooding. The Kenyan government paused the search and rescue operation on Saturday evening but said it would resume on Sunday.\"Preparation to supply more food and non-food relief items to the victims is underway,\" said Murkomen, adding: \"Military and police choppers are on standby to transport the items.\"Kenya is in its second rainy season when it usually experiences a few weeks of wet weather compared to a heavier, more prolonged period earlier in the year. The government has urged people living near seasonal rivers as well as areas that experienced landslides on Friday to move to safer ground.Meanwhile, flash flooding and landslides in Uganda, near the border with Kenya, have killed a number of people since last Wednesday.On Saturday, the Uganda Red Cross said another mudslide had occurred in Kapsomo village in the east of the country, destroying a house and killing four people inside. The Red Cross said floods had severely affected most villages near riverbanks in the Bulambuli District. It said continuous heavy rainfall had caused the River Astiri and the River Sipi \"to overflow, resulting in widespread destruction of homes, crop fields, and community infrastructure\".",

    "body": "Thousands of military homes across the UK will be modernised, refurbished or rebuilt over the next decade under a £9bn government plan to improve defence housing.The Ministry of Defence's new housing strategy will see improvements made to almost all of its 47,700 homes for military families in what Defence Secretary John Healey said will be the \"biggest renewal of Armed Forces housing in more than 50 years\".The plan is in response to consistent complaints from serving personnel about the state of their accommodation. In 2022, dozens of members and their families told the BBC they were having to live in damp, mould-infested housing without heating.A Commons defence committee last year found two-thirds of homes for service families needed \"extensive refurbishment or rebuilding\" to meet modern standards.Under the new strategy, service family accommodation (SFA) will be refurbished with new kitchens, bathrooms and heating systems.About 14,000 will receive either \"substantial refurbishment\" or be completely replaced.The plans are part of the government's wider defence housing strategy, to be published on Monday. A total of £4bn in funding to tackle the housing problem had already been announced. The government says it has also identified surplus MoD land which could be used to build 100,000 new homes for civilian and military families.Healey said: \"This is a new chapter - a decisive break from decades of underinvestment, with a building programme to back Britain's military families and drive economic growth across the country.\"Almost three years ago, the BBC was contacted by families in military accommodation in Sandhurst who had been living without heating for days.\"We're at breaking point and something has to change. The system is broken,\" they said at the time.In response to the story, the MoD said it was working with its contractors to improve the service. But a report released in December last year found those problems \"still exist\". \"It is shocking that until a policy change in 2022, it was considered acceptable to house families in properties known to have damp and mould,\" the report said.The MoD last year announced it would acquire 36,347 military houses from property company Annington Homes for nearly £6bn, reversing a privatisation deal struck in 1996 under the Conservative government.The deal would save millions in rent and maintenance costs, the MoD said, money that would be put towards fixing military accommodation.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivUkraine's top military commander has admitted his soldiers are facing \"difficult conditions\" defending Pokrovsk - a key eastern front-line town - against massed Russian forces.Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi said Ukrainian troops were facing a \"multi-thousand enemy\" force - but denied Russian claims that they were surrounded or blocked.He confirmed that elite special forces had been deployed to protect key supply lines which, army sources said, were all under Russian fire.The defence ministry in Moscow reported that Ukrainian troops were surrendering and 11 of their special forces had been killed after landing by helicopter, something denied by Kyiv.In Saturday's posts on Telegram, Gen Syrskyi said he was \"back on the front\" to personally hear the latest reports from military commanders on the ground in the eastern Donetsk region.In a short video, Syrskyi is seen studying battlefield maps with other commanders, including the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov.It is unclear when and where the footage was recorded.Ukrainian media earlier reported that Budanov was in the region to personally oversee the operation by the special forces.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Ukraine's 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Saturday Ukrainian troops \"have improved [their] tactical position\" in Pokrovsk - but the situation remained \"difficult and dynamic\".Late on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that the defence of Pokrovsk was a \"priority\".There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of the Russian-seized regional capital of Donetsk. Images shared with news agencies late on Friday appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the Donetsk and the neighbouring Luhansk regions (collectively known as Donbas) as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula Moscow annexed in 2014.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has publicly agreed with Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Putin is refusing to do so, insisting on his maximalist pre-invasion demands that Kyiv and its Western allies see as a de facto capitulation of Ukraine.Additional reporting by Jaroslav Lukiv",

    "body": "10 hours agoGetty ImagesThousands of people from some of Scotland's most deprived areas are to be offered free weight-loss jabs as part of government-funded research.Up to 5,000 people in Scotland will take the injections as part of the multi-million pound study being led by Glasgow University.The findings will provide insight into the lives of people living with obesity and health inequalities across the UK.If successful, it could lead to a wider rollout of the injections throughout the country.The jabs copy or boost the effects of natural hormones called incretins, which control blood sugar levels.They act on areas of the brain which impact hunger and appetite and can slow down how fast the stomach empties. This may help people living with obesity regulate their eating habits.The UK government has provided an initial £650,000 for the Scotland CardioMetabolic Impact Study (SCoMIS).As a leading cause of long-term illness such as heart disease and cancer, tackling obesity will help millions live longer healthier lives and reduce the pressure on health services, potentially saving the NHS billions annually.UK Health Innovation Minister Dr Zubir Ahmed said: \"As a practicing NHS surgeon and Glasgow MP, I know firsthand the impact of the obesity crisis that plagues Scotland – and the litany of health problems it leads to.\"More than 1 in 3 adults in Scotland's most deprived areas are living with obesity. The UK government is committed to tackling inequality wherever it finds it in our country. \"It's why this landmark UK government investment is targeting help where it's needed most in Scotland and meeting people where they are and backing helping the NHS services they trust to treat them.\"Aims of the study:To test how weight‑loss medicines can be delivered effectively and fairly in everyday NHS care. To measure the level of weight loss and improvements in quality of life, particularly for patients in disadvantaged areas.To examine the impact on obesity‑related illness, NHS use, and overall healthcare costs.To explore whether better health through weight loss can help people stay in work, reduce sick leave, and take a fuller part in society.Jason Gill, professor of cardiometabolic health at Glasgow University, who is leading the study, said: \"While tackling obesity requires multifactorial public health action, incretin therapies add a powerful new tool to the national obesity strategy. \"The burden of obesity is greatest in the most deprived segments of society and the status quo risks widening health inequalities.\"SCoMIS aims to be a landmark real‑world study evaluating a new model of obesity care, providing incretin treatment via primary and community care to Scottish adults living with obesity, with a focus on those in the most economically deprived communities.\"'Cutting-edge research'Jenni Minto, Scottish minister for public health, said the Scottish government was proud to be leading the way in tackling obesity through innovation and collaboration. \"This study places patients and communities at the heart of cutting-edge research into weight-loss medicines, ensuring we build the evidence needed to deliver the greatest benefit to those who need it most,\" she said.UK Science Minister Lord Vallance said: \"Scotland has always been at the forefront of medical innovation and public health, and this initiative is further proof of the world-class expertise that can be found here.\"By learning how these weight-loss medicines work, and how we can support them to reach our most deprived areas, we can slash health inequalities in Scotland and the rest of the UK so that our obesity strategy delivers a real, lasting change.\"The study, which will be launched next year, also involves industry leaders Novo Nordisk and IQVIA, as well as clinical leaders at the Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh.They will work out how to make best use of AI driven digital technologies to support patient access, engagement and data collection.The study will involve 3,000 to 5,000 Scottish patients living with obesity who will benefit from the medicines the most.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has unveiled renovations to the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom, as his remodelling of the White House continues.Trump shared photos of the new bathroom on social media, saying it had been \"renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era\".He claimed the new black and white marble is \"very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\".It is the latest change Trump has made to the White House this year. In October, its East Wing was demolished to make way for his new multi-million dollar ballroom.The bathroom is a part of Abraham Lincoln's office and cabinet room, which former President Harry Truman fixed up as a part of his massive renovation of the White House in the late 1940s. The wallpaper of Lincoln's office and bedroom was once coloured in green and gold, according to the White House Historical Association. After Trump's remodelling, it now features gold fixtures and accents for the sink, bathtub faucet and shower door, as well as a chandelier. The White House said the renovation was privately funded at no cost to the taxpayer.The US president's attempts to put his own stamp on the White House have prompted criticism from conservation groups and his political opponents.  Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the East Wing would not \"interfere with the current building\". But in October, he said the \"existing structure\" had to be torn down. Trump said the ballroom construction was being fully funded by him and \"some friends of mine - donors\".Conservationists argued Trump should have sought public review before making the changes, which they say would overwhelm the classical style of the White House. The White House hit back at its critics, saying \"unhinged leftists\" were \"clutching their pearls over President Donald J Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House - a bold, necessary addition\".Other changes to the White House include his decision in August to pave over grass in the Rose Garden with stone, transforming a lawn into a patio. Trump also added touches of gilded gold all over the Oval Office, including additional portraits framed in gold, gold-framed mirrors and a gold leaf for the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office.In response to his latest bathroom renovation, the Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on remaking the White House than solving the government shutdown.Central to the shutdown, which is now entering its second month, is a dispute over whether to extend health insurance subsidies.\"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on social media.Speaking at an event on Saturday, former US President Barack Obama said Trump has been \"focused on critical issues, like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don't get mud on their shoes and gold plating the Oval Office and building a $300m ballroom\" than resolving the shutdown. \"If you can't visit a doctor, don't worry. He will save you a dance,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Skateboarding the Wild Atlantic Way for suicide awareness8 days agoJamie McColganBBC News NIBecky GilmourBecky Gilmour set out on the west coast in June and is hoping to complete her mission by DecemberA young woman from Banbridge is skateboarding across the Wild Atlantic Way in Ireland to raise awareness of suicide.Becky Gilmour is at the final stretch of the journey and hopes to complete it by December before the weather takes a turn.The 26-year-old has spent the last five months travelling along the 2,500km (1,553 miles) coastal route that stretches from Kinsale in County Cork, to Inishowen in County Donegal.Becky set out on the west coast in June, inspired to help \"open up the conversation around suicide\", after losing a friend to it during the Covid-19 pandemic. Becky GimourBecky Gilmour is skateboarding the entire Wild Atlantic Way'I do just love an adventure'Skating anywhere from 20 to 60km (12 to 37 miles) a day, Becky said she \"is no athlete\", and hopes that those following her on social media will see that anybody can get out there and do the same.She noticed growing up that outdoor pursuits looked expensive, and felt put off from giving them a go.She said she hopes this trip proves otherwise.\"I want adventure and outdoors to be accessible for everyone,\" she said.She added that her skateboard has surprisingly needed \"no repairs\", and little maintenance.Becky has arrived in County Mayo, which she has really enjoyed so far as \"their road surfaces are the best\".\"I've had two hard falls now,\" she added.\"The road surfaces in some places are so tough for a skateboard. There's been times where I catch myself just laughing at what I'm doing because it's so utterly ridiculous but, you know, all part of the fun.\"Becky GilmourSome have noticed Becky on her journey from her social media postsShe has also taken to the sea on a paddleboard with the help of her friend Adam when visiting islands off the coast including Aran, Inishbofin, and Clare, much to the disbelief of the locals.Becky has slowed down recently to visit some schools, but looks to speed up again before winter sets in, and arrive at the north coast by mid-December.The trip will then finish in Portrush in County Antrim, where Becky bought her first longboard with her friend, before he died.'Together with the waves'Becky GilmourThis mural has an Irish message, meaning \"together with the waves\"With each county she visits, Becky leaves behind a mural to \"share hope and support for those who are struggling\".  These come out of pocket or donations she has received.\"I'm so well looked after by folks that I meet along the way,\" she said, with some offering bed and board to assist in her journey,  she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.Staying in a campervan with her friend by the coast, she once received an unusual gift from a local.\"He knocked on the van, woke us up, and just chucked a lobster at me while I was sleeping.\"He gifted it to us, but he left really quickly.\"We didn't have the heart to kill it, we ended up having to just put it back in the ocean.\"Allow Instagram content?This article contains content provided by Instagram.

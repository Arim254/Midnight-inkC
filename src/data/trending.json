    "body": "15 hours agoNick EardleyPolitical correspondentBBCA BBC investigation found asylum seekers in hotels were taking taxi journeys costing hundreds of poundsA ban on asylum seekers using taxis to attend medical appointments has come into force.The government changed the policy after a BBC investigation which showed people travelling long distances at high cost.In one case, an asylum seeker said he went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, costing the Home Office £600.The ban will not stop the use of taxis completely and there will be some exemptions for people with physical disabilities, chronic illnesses and pregnancy-related needs.These cases will have to be signed off by the Home Office under the new rules.Taxis can also still be used for other reasons - such as travelling between accommodation. The Home Office is continuing to review that situation.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"I have ended the wasteful use of taxis for medical appointments to protect the taxpayer's purse.\"I will stop at nothing to remove the incentives that draw illegal migrants to Britain, to restore order and control to our borders.\"It was revealed in November that an average of £15.8m had been spent a year on taxis for asylum seekers.Earlier this year, BBC Radio 4's File on Four found asylum seekers were being issued with a bus pass for one return journey per week. For other necessary travel, like doctor's appointments, taxis were used.One driver told the BBC his firm would do up to 15 drop-offs daily from a hotel in south-east London to a doctors surgery around two miles away. These journeys alone would cost the Home Office £1,000 a day, he said.Another taxi driver, who gave the name Steve, claimed firms would purposely increase the mileage on trips by dispatching drivers to another distant town to carry out short journeys.He said that on one occasion he was sent from Gatwick Airport to Reading - a round trip of about 110 miles (175km) and costing more than £100 - to take an asylum seeker from their hotel to a dentist appointment which was 1.5 miles away.Steve said that while working for a subcontractor he was sent from Gatwick to Southampton \"more than once\", and that he drove an average of 275 miles a day - half of which was without a passenger in his car.He claimed that some journeys were completely wasted.\"I'd be sitting there and [would be told] 'oh look don't worry, [the asylum seekers] don't wanna go' and they basically refused to move. It just logistically wasn't thought out very well and I think it was left open to abuse,\" he said.",

    "body": "When Chelsea's David Datro Fofana completed a deadline-day loan move to Strasbourg on Monday, he became the 12th transfer between the clubs this season.The activity between the BlueCo partners has started to raise eyebrows.Rather than simple loan arrangements like that of Fofana, some players have moved back and forth for fees. Chelsea plucked head coach Liam Rosenior away as well, much to the annoyance of Strasbourg. There is no suggestion there is anything untoward, and the deals have all been carried out within the rules. But could such a high number of transfers between two teams within multi-club ownership (MCO) be a trigger for Fifa or Uefa? The game's governing bodies are keeping a close eye on the situation.So far action has been limited to clubs being removed from competitions where there might be a conflict of interest.Last year, Fifa disqualified Leon from the Club World Cup, and Uefa demoted Crystal Palace from the Europa League.Chelsea's transfer business has been the catalyst for change in Fifa's transfer regulations once before. Could it be again?Chelsea and Strasbourg came together under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital's BlueCo group in 2023.Across the first two years Strasbourg got the best of the deal. Six players left Chelsea for the French club, five on loan and one permanently. Strasbourg were able to spend money they could only have dreamed about.In the three years before BlueCo, Strasbourg's total transfer fees paid per season were £6.1m, £3.9m and £9.5m.In the following three seasons Strasbourg spent £52.6m, £53.6m and £96.5m. They were the biggest-spending club in France last summer, outgunning even Paris St-Germain (£89.2m).Those additional resources helped Strasbourg challenge for a place in the Champions League last season.But last summer the way the two clubs did business began to change. The pendulum would swing towards the dominant MCO partner in Chelsea. Take central defender Mamadou Sarr, who in June joined Chelsea from Strasbourg on a permanent deal.The 20-year-old made only one appearance for Chelsea as a substitute at the Fifa Club World Cup. In August he went back to Strasbourg on loan. On Monday he was recalled by Chelsea.BlueCo would argue this is a key part of player development - that Sarr would get regular football at Strasbourg and return to Stamford Bridge a better player. Then there is the case of Ishe Samuels-Smith. The left-back moved from Chelsea to Strasbourg in July. He was then re-signed by Chelsea in September - and immediately loaned to Swansea City.In the world of multi-club ownership there is logic to it. With Ben Chilwell not part of Enzo Maresca's plans the full-back was sent to Strasbourg on a free transfer. The Ligue 1 club had also resolved a contract dispute with another defender, Ismael Doukoure.It left Samuels-Smith as a spare part in Alsace. Rather than leave the 19-year-old struggling for first-team football, Chelsea effectively refunded the £6.5m transfer fee and sent him to the Championship club.Club captain Emmanuel Emegha is already confirmed to be the next on the conveyor belt to Stamford Bridge.The 20-year-old striker, one of BlueCo's first signings at Strasbourg, will join Chelsea at the end of the season.The club's ultras - long-time critics of the association with BlueCo - demanded he hand back the captain's armband.Outsiders see players (and indeed the head coach) jumping around from club to club at the behest of Chelsea.Take Aaron Anselmino. The centre-back spent the first half of the season on loan at Borussia Dortmund from Chelsea.Yet when Chelsea wanted Sarr in their first team, Anselmino was recalled from the Bundesliga club and sent to fill the hole in the Strasbourg squad. Anselmino was reportedly in tears when he left Dortmund. Chelsea were shifting chess pieces to suit their own strategy.Yet recalling loan players from one club to send them to another should not be seen as special to a multi-club ownership structure. For instance, last month Manchester United brought Harry Amass back from a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday and sent him to Norwich City instead.Chelsea's transfer business has attracted the attention of Fifa before, leading to a reshaping of the regulations in 2022.  Along with Juventus and Atalanta, Chelsea had become the poster boys of player hoarding - signing a high number of players and loaning them out. Former Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo had drawn up the concept of the so-called loan army. Up to 35 players were sent out on loan across Europe at any one time.Fifa stepped in to \"develop young players, promote competitive balance and prevent hoarding\", and enforced a limit of six players aged over 21 who could be loaned out. Most importantly for MCOs, Fifa said a maximum of three players could be loaned to one club. Chelsea would point out they have simply been fully utilising this option. BBC Sport understands that Fifa does not have any appetite to look again at its transfer regulations.Indeed, football finance expert Kieran Maguire told BBC Sport that Fifa would be on \"a fairly sticky wicket\" if it was seen to be treating clubs unequally.Maguire added MCOs would simply find a way of getting around it, perhaps by changing the structure of shareholdings. \"They will find another loophole,\" Maguire said. \"It is a situation that is easy to manipulate.\"There would be other concerns, too, with half the clubs across the top five European leagues in some kind of MCO.\"So many clubs are in MCOs that to introduce a set of rules would impinge upon them,\" Maguire added.\"Chelsea are far from the worst offenders. Take a look at the number of transactions between Watford and Udinese. \"They would say that they're not an MCO, they just happen to be owned by different parts of the family, the Pozzo family.\"Watford and Udinese are just one example of clubs outside of an MCO engaging in multiple transfers. Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis signed four players from Botafogo in the summer. Murillo then went in the opposite direction with one of the signings, Jair Cunha, immediately going back on loan. John Textor, the majority owner of Botafogo, said Marinakis \"has effectively become that partner\" when discussing transfer agreements across leagues. Uefa has been talking critically about MCOs for some time. It its European Club Footballing Landscape report in 2023 it said that the \"growth in multi-club investment has the potential to distort transfer activity\".The report added that it has led to transfers at \"prices that suit investors, rather than at fair values, to the detriment of trainer clubs\".The Premier League says it has checks and balances in place to make sure all transfer deals are completed to fair market value - either loan or permanent. The only time related-party loan deals came up at a Premier League shareholders' meeting was in 2023.Clubs were concerned Newcastle could use their Saudi Arabian links to bring in players on loan at minimal cost.A vote to outlaw such incoming loans just for the 2024 winter transfer window was narrowly defeated. MCO-style transfer deals have not been discussed since.MCOs have grown further since the Uefa report. Indeed, it was later that year that BlueCo bought Strasbourg.Yet there is little Uefa can actually do, other than introduce tougher regulations on access to its own competitions.When Manchester United and Nice, and Manchester City and Girona, were admitted to the same European competition in 2024-25, transfers between the clubs were banned for three windows.Last year Uefa were more strict by bringing forward the deadline for MCO compliance to 1 March. That caught out Palace, but has yet to be tested with one of the bigger clubs like Manchester United or Manchester City.Uefa is expected to try to go further, concerned that MCOs present \"a material threat to the integrity of European club competitions\".Chelsea would argue it is unfair to single them out purely because they are part of an MCO, and that they play by the rules.In any case, MCO transfer deals are commonplace. They would say they behave in a similar way to the Red Bull Group, who sold Nicolas Seiwald and Benjamin Sesko from Red Bull Salzburg to RB Leipzig in 2023.Deals are planned according to strategic needs - good for players and probably good for both clubs.A player might return to Stamford Bridge ready for first-team football, as was the case with winger Andrey Santos and now Sarr.Or performances at Strasbourg can see a player's value increase and improve their career chances. Goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic was sold to Bournemouth for £25m last summer - double the fee paid to New England Revolution in 2023 and it made him a Premier League number one.Strasbourg have benefitted from Chelsea's scouting network and resources, too.Take forward Joaquin Panichelli, signed for £14m from Alaves last summer. The 23-year-old, who has scored 11 Ligue 1 goals this season, earned his first senior cap for Argentina in November. Panichelli was reportedly the subject of transfer enquiries at the end of the window, with Strasbourg quoting a price of £43m.The association with BlueCo has enabled Strasbourg to not only spend big on players, but also reject offers. Other clubs in France may argue it is too beneficial for Strasbourg with the resources they have access to. The problem for Strasbourg will always be when Chelsea come calling. Strasbourg can benefit from the loan system and finances but if Chelsea want the next Sarr, Rosenior or Emegha there is nothing anyone can do about it. That is the compromise. Football fans may not like it, but it has been going on for years in many different forms. Chelsea and BlueCo are just doing it their own way.",

    "body": "2 hours agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThirty-six infants in the UK have had suspected food poisoning from contaminated baby formula.It comes after specific batches made by Nestle and Danone were recalled because of contamination with the toxin, cereulide.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it has received clinical notifications of young children developing symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhoea, consistent with cereulide poisoning.None of the infants – all around or under one – are reported to be gravely ill, the BBC understands.Gauri Godbole, from UKHSA, said it was not unexpected, given \"the widespread availability\" of the affected products prior to the recall and \"subsequent testing\". Godbole said there did not seem to be any signs that huge numbers of children had been affected so far.\"Current surveillance indicators do not show unusual increases in reports of vomiting in children under the age of one for this time of year,\" she added.But the agency said it would continue monitoring the situation and providing updates.CrampsThe UKHSA has not been able to confirm categorically that the infants had been poisoned but it has been confirmed they consumed the specific brands of infant formula affected.The Danone batch affected is the 800g pack coded EXP 31-10-2026.Meanwhile, for Nestle it relates to a number of products, including SMA infant formula and follow-on formula. The batches  affected are listed on the company's website. Of the 36 cases, 24 were in England, seven in Scotland, three in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and with the final case reported to be in one of the Crown Dependencies, which includes the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.The UK is not the only country affected with both European nations and those from other parts of the world reporting products have been contaminated.Cereulide is a toxin which is unlikely to be destroyed by cooking, or when making the infant milk.If it is consumed it can lead to symptoms like nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps developing quickly.The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said the toxin was present in a specific ingredient identified as arachidonic acid oil. The oil is added to infant formula to give it some of the important growth properties contained in breast milk.The FSA has urged parents who had any of the affected products left, to stop using them and switch to an alternative formula.If you have fed it to your baby and are concerned, contact your GP or NHS 111 for advice, it added.The FSA is working with manufacturers to trace all products that may have used the affected ingredient and ensure all affected products are removed from sale.FSA director of policy Rebecca Sudworth said: \"Along with international partners as part of this global recall, we are investigating the supply chain. \"We need to know from manufacturers what went wrong and get assurances from the companies involved that it won't happen again. \"The FSA will not hesitate to take further action if required.\"",

    "body": "40 minutes agoZoe KleinmanTechnology editorGetty ImagesThe boss of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the public body which spends £8bn of taxpayer money each year on research and innovation in the UK, has warned the organisation faces \"hard decisions\" on funding future projects.In an open letter, Ian Chapman said the government had told it to \"focus and do fewer things better\", which \"will result in negative outcomes for some\".It represents a major reorganisation of the way Britain's scientific research and innovation is prioritised and funded with public money, and has angered many in the research community.Chapman said the changes have not yet been finalised, but he expected them to be fully implemented by April 2027.In a later briefing, he declined to explain how research projects would be selected in future.But he said overall, the money available to researchers was set to increase in the future with \"more emphasis on commercialisation\".Funding for what UKRI describes as \"curiosity driven\" research, which Chapman said the UK is \"really good at\", is to remain at the same level - effectively a decrease in real terms as time goes on.In the past this has included studying blood clot detection, plastic-eating enzymes and how babies learn.\"When you make choices some will miss out, but if you don't make choices everybody loses out,\" Chapman said.'The funding isn't there'UKRI is made up of eight separate research councils, which have various disciplines including medicine and biotechnology. One of them is the Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC), which is responsible for research into topics such as astronomy, computational science, and nuclear physics.It currently pays the UK's membership to the Swiss laboratory Cern and the European Space Agency, and it also supports and operates some of the world's biggest telescopes. It has been instructed to find £162m in savings.\"The STFC was extremely ambitious in what it wanted to do and the funding isn't there,\" said its executive chair Michele Dougherty.She said there were no plans to withdraw from existing international commitments.And she added it was too early to say whether the council would fund any new projects in the next couple of years - but did suggest if it did, it would be at the expense of something it is currently supporting.Other councils have also paused grants for new research.\"The UK punches above its weight in scientific impact and in space-related industry,\" said Chris Lintott, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University.\"This should be a national success story but instead we are facing the possibility of unsettling and destabilising threats to funding for cutting edge science.\"The changes have also impacted Innovate UK, which supports small and medium sized businesses with grants and advice.The BBC understands local business advisors have been laid off, and those left have been instructed not take on any new \"clients\" – science and tech businesses seeking funding and guidance.\"In the past we have supported thousands of start-ups with small amounts of money,\" said Chapman.\"We are now seeking to support fewer companies.\"He did not explain how those companies will be selected.Backing businessesIn the commercial sector, around 75% of businesses which receive private funding from venture capitalists fail. It is notoriously difficult to identify those which will succeed early on.\"Reducing budgets and staffing for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) support at Innovate UK is the opposite of what our domestic start-up and entrepreneur community needs,\" said Stephen Tulip, UK manager of the App Association.\"Cutting access to expertise and funding for UK SMEs will harm the UK's growth agenda and force start-ups to look elsewhere for investment and support.\"Mike Griffin, who founded a sustainable 3D printing company with the help of Innovate UK, agreed.\"For small companies, early-stage backing is the bridge to market,\" he said. \"If support shifts toward bigger, later-stage winners, many practical, life-changing innovations won't survive long enough to scale.\"",

    "body": "What do you do if you fall 40 feet on to hard-packed snow? If you're a Winter Olympian, you pick yourself up and try again.There is a fine line between success and failure in winter sports, where a few millimetres when landing difficult tricks on snow can make the difference between a medal or serious injury.Dealing with the fear of what might happen if things go wrong is just as important for an elite Winter OIympic athlete as honing any other skill of their craft.The jeopardy is real as athletes heading to the Milan-Cortina Games push the limits of what is physically possible in their sports while pushing themselves out of their comfort zones.\"The biggest challenge of my sport is definitely overcoming the fear,\" says freestyle skier and Team GB Winter Olympic medal hopeful Zoe Atkin, who is preparing for her second Winter Games.The 23-year-old competes in ski halfpipe, where competitors drop into a 22-foot deep pipe and complete as many tricks as they can while jumping as high out of the halfpipe as possible.They are judged on the amplitude - the height they reach - as well as the difficulty of the tricks and how well they have executed them.Stanford University student Atkin is studying symbolic systems in the United States. It has aided in her quest to emulate older sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal.\"Symbolic systems is interdisciplinary. It's a lot to do with computer science as well as cognitive science. It's studying machines that simulate the brain.\"Being able to understand fear from a biological process has helped me on the slopes,\" she says.For Atkin, fear is at its lowest, maybe unexpectedly, on competition day.\"That's just nervousness around the result and performing to your best, which is easier to combat,\" she tells BBC Sport. \"I do meditation in the morning, to focus on the now.\"The fear comes in training;  when you are practising something you are not familiar with, that is when the uncertainty comes in.\"When a spectator watches a sport, they might think we are adrenaline junkies. But it is very precise - we are just a niche athlete.\"Zoe's sister Izzy claimed slopestyle bronze in Pyeongchang in 2018.It gave Britain a first skiing medal at a Winter Olympics - 16 years after Alain Baxter lost his slalom bronze when he failed a drugs test after using an over-the-counter nasal decongestant that he believed to be permitted.Zoe was watching from the stands eight years ago in South Korea with her parents, and her sister's achievements spurred her on to pursue her own skiing career.\"Working with a sports psychologist has been important - when I was younger, I felt more intense fear, which was a barrier to performance,\" Atkin says.\"I am pretty young still, but there were a lot of expectations internally, things I want to achieve.\"She heads into the Games as the reigning world champion and this season has finished on the podium in each of the World Cups, including a win at Copper Mountain and claimed gold at the X Games.\"Now I've won things, surely I shouldn't be afraid and I should have confidence?\" she says.\"But no matter how established you are, there's always a comfort zone you need to push to progress. It's always a continuous progress, a journey I now have more fully embraced.\"Atkin has been fortunate in that she has avoided serious injuries, unlike her sister who broke her pelvis just before the 2022 Winter Olympics and has since retired from competitive skiing.GB team-mate Kirsty Muir has also had her fair share of injuries.The 21-year-old competes in ski slopestyle and big air. She rides rails and performs tricks of large ramps.She knows all too well about the horrors of serious injury in the line of duty.In December 2023, a scan revealed that repeated blows to her knee had resulted in a torn cruciate ligament, ruling her out for a year.Muir, having \"never not skied for that long in my life\", says she is fit and firing for Milan-Cortina – but admits the road back was hard.\"The sport progresses continually, so having that much time off was difficult,\" Muir tells BBC Sport.Muir has won World Cup events in ski slopestyle and big air this season and also won at the X Games but is no stranger to the occasional crash landing.The key to overcoming that fear, she says, is accepting they will happen.\"The injury wasn't my scariest, as it didn't happen at a specific moment,\" she says. \"It's more when things out of your control go wrong.\"I've had skis come off my feet or my goggles come over my eyes when about to jump, and I've been flying through the air without skis on my feet. That is a weird feeling.\"We are good at adapting to situations, not thinking about it until it happens. There is no point in worrying - be prepared, then adapt.\"In the moment before beginning a run, with a giant halfpipe or slopestyle course or big air jump in front of them, what is running through an athlete's mind?Atkin thinks of nothing at all.\"Meditation is more like an umbrella term for mindfulness,\" she says. \"But I do sit down, doing the hand pose, for about 10 minutes before going up. You can overthink things and overinflate the risks, wonder if fears are plausible and reframing them - it lets me disregard thoughts that are unhelpful, like 'what if I fall?'.\"I've had scary falls. It is all part of the process; it takes a certain mental strength - to be OK with falling.\"Part of our training is falling safely; if you are about to over-rotate, it is better to open and land on your side. That air awareness is something you train on. We can take big falls and know we are prepared to take them.\"I was working on this trick I previously had a mental block on.\"I would sit at the top, full of fear, trip and fall on my hip repeatedly. But I committed to finishing it - little steps every day, pushing myself to confront my fear. That allowed myself to build my confidence, and it felt like a personal victory as well.\"GB Snowsport, the national governing body, has worked with athletes on calming techniques – including by taking some freediving, to learn how to stay focused when out of their comfort zone, as well as breathing techniques under high pressure.According to Muir, the best way to prepare is to start that preparation long, long before you drop in.\"The times I feel fear are when I am trying something new, that feels more like a leap of faith,\" she says.\"When we are going for a new trick, it is never from zero to 100. You do each step to make sure you are comfortable. Then you go for it, which is difficult.\"I centre myself - there is a moment you have got to try. Those moments are scariest, but most rewarding. It is thinking toward that moment.\"The most important thing is accepting that our sport is risky, but it is something I have chosen to do. I am the one in control.\"At the top of the course, all those thoughts go away - I try to think it's just me and the course, and put in the best run I can.\"In the battle to make sure fear doesn't win, Atkin and Muir have very different approaches.Atkin says: \"I can tell me it is just bodily reactions, and it is understandable - it would be crazy if I didn't feel fear. Just reframing fear as something more positive, that you can do it even if you have that fear.\"If you were to take a regular person and drop them in a halfpipe, logically you feel fear. But we train our whole lives for one specific thing.\"Muir's attitude is a little less logical. While thoroughly grounded in training and technique as a world champion athlete, there is also superstition and a little bit of music sprinkled in the mix.\"I have a lucky snood - the face masks people use when they ski - always on my person,\" she says.\"I got it off one of the skiers I admired at the dry ski slope when I was younger, and I've always had it with me.\"And I have The Pretender by Foo Fighters as my competition song - I only play it at comps, that helps me switch off. Then during training, I have rock music.\"My dad listened to rock, and my sister loves [Foo Fighters singer Dave Grohl's former band] Nirvana, so I started listening and it spiralled from there.\"",

    "body": "Robbie Williams: British people are good at devaluing ourselves12 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesAfter more than three decades in entertainment, Robbie Williams is back on the road and ready to celebrate.The singer, whose Long 90s tour begins this week, is taking a moment to mark his achievement. \"I think as British people we're very good at piercing the balloon of our own success and undercutting it and devaluing ourselves,\" he tells BBC News. \"It's what we do best. In many ways it's why we're great.\"But with this one, I really want to let it sink in and I really want to stand in the middle of it and go, 'OK, success, do your thing to me'.\"The tour will take in smaller venues, the kind he would have played at the start of his solo stardom. The 51-year-old says Britpop is the album he wanted to make when he first left Take That. It sees him collaborate with former bandmate Gary Barlow, Gaz Coombes from Supergrass and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.But he looks back at the Britpop era with mixed feelings - he experienced professional huge success, but was also deeply depressed. Getty ImagesRobbie pictured with Liam Gallagher at Glastonbury in 1995, at the height of BritpopHe recalls: \"I was going through my own mental illness and anything good that's happening to somebody that is in the throes of depression... they can't experience joy and there were lots of incredible things happening and I couldn't experience joy from any of it.\"But now I look back at it and think, what a decade. The last great decade for popular culture because everything since then has become quite vanilla.\"You don't know 2007 from 2023, but you know the '50s, you know the '60s, you know the '70s you know the '80s and you know the '90s and so I look back and with a wry smile and say that the '90s was an amazing time to have a bad time.\"Robbie has spoken openly about suffering from stage fright in the past, experiencing terror before walking on stage. He tells me that everything \"clicked into place\" for him when his first child, daughter Theodora, known as Teddy, who was born in 2012. \"The world started to make sense because I'd been running away from responsibility and I should have been running towards it. \"And when things stopped being about me and started to become about precious souls, I started to realise I've got the best job in the world.\"Getty ImagesRobbie with Ayda and eldest daughter Teddy, who was born in 2012Williams says he also feels much happier being back in the UK, after a torrid experience with the British press, particularly in the early stages of his solo career. \"I think that everybody knows, because we've seen it countless times, that if you are on the crest of a wave, the media comes to bring you down and attack you and malign you at every opportunity they can. And that is heavy and brings its own problems.\"But that was then, I'm in a different place now,\" he continues. \"I'm left alone just to put my songs out and be married. \"There isn't anybody at my door trying to get pictures of me 24 hours a day or trying to pop microphones and bug my house or trying to hack my phone. There isn't any of that stuff that's happening anymore. This is what I thought it would be like when I set out on my journey when I was 16, I'm having an amazing time.\"Williams, pictured with the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher, says he's glad social media was not around earlier in his careerOne thing the singer did not have deal with back then was social media, and he tells me he thinks it would have \"seen him off\". \"I get way too invested in finding the negative things, everybody does,\" he says. \"I wonder if there's something wired in us where we go, ‘let's find the problem, let's find a threat and then we'll negate the threat’.\"Then, of course, there is the eternal question, will Robbie ever rejoin Take That? The band that launched his career.Williams has spoken of them \"riding again\" and says he \"absolutely loved\" the documentary, adding that he had \"overwhelming feeling of how much I love the boys\".Getty ImagesTake That were recently the subject of a Netflix documentary, which examined their successOn February 13 it will be 30 years since Take That split (the first time), it's also Robbie's birthday. So what was he doing that day in 1996? \"Buying a Scalextric from Harrods,\" he laughs. Not the rock'n'roll answer I expected.After breaking a record held by The Beatles and winning more Brit Awards than anyone else, I ask Robbie what he wants to do next.\"I want to build hotels with my own venues in and then I want to play my own hotels,\" he replies.\"I want to do a university of entertainment and I've got the syllabus in my mind and it would be a great revenge on education for somebody that left school with nothing higher than a D to go in and revolutionise education.\" Sign us up for the university of Robbie Williams.Britpop by Robbie Williams is out now. The Long 90s tour began earlier this week. ",

    "body": "53 minutes agoEthan GudgeSouth of EnglandGetty ImagesThe duke married Edla Griffiths, his second wife, in 2002 but they separated in 2024The Duke of Marlborough faces allegations of controlling or coercive behaviour towards his estranged wife, as well as accusations he strangled her on three occasions, according to a court indictment.He has also been charged with two counts of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship towards his wife between 29 December 2015 and 8 September 2024, the indictment says.Oxford Crown Court heard on Thursday an application to dismiss the case had been made, which will be heard on 27 April.Overseeing the hearing, Judge Ian Pringle KC set a provisional plea hearing for 22 June and a trial in January 2028.During the appearance, the duke spoke only to confirm his name and that he understood the conditions of his bail.He was not asked to enter formal pleas for the five charges.PA MediaThe duke appeared at Oxford Crown Court on ThursdayThe three attacks are alleged to have taken place in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, between November 2022 and May 2024.A previous hearing at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court heard the duke is accused of striking Edla Marlborough several times before placing his hands around her neck and squeezing them together before letting go on 13 November 2022.The court was told the 2022 incident occurred following an argument in the garden of their home.On 23 April 2023 he allegedly grabbed her hair, before hitting her with a closed fist and then grabbing her neck.The accusation describes Edla Marlborough running into a laundry room before being attacked.On 29 January 2024 he is accused of grabbing her \"tightly around the neck\".Prosecutors said, the duke, who previously gave his address as Blenheim Palace, grabbed her around the neck before throwing her on a bed.Getty ImagesBlenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, is the duke's ancestral homeThe twice-married aristocrat, formerly known as the Marquess of Blandford, married his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, in 2002.They are said to have met while she was living in Chelsea and working on her art, and they wed after dating for seven years.The pair are thought to have separated in 2024.He inherited his dukedom in 2014, following the death of his father, the 11th Duke of Marlborough.He is a first cousin, three times removed, of Sir Winston Churchill and a distant relative of the late Princess Diana through the Spencer family.His ancestral family home is Blenheim Palace in Woodstock – Sir Winston's birthplace - which is owned and managed by Blenheim Palace Heritage Foundation.The foundation said, in a previous statement, it was \"unable to comment on the charges, which relate to the duke's personal conduct and private life, and which are subject to live, criminal proceedings\".It added: \"The foundation is not owned or managed by the Duke of Marlborough, but by independent entities run by boards of trustees.\"Related storiesRelated link",

    "body": "2 hours agoPaulin KolaReutersEuropean allies of the US have made more concessions to the US over Greenland than they publicly admit, Vice-President JD Vance has said.\"We definitely have gotten much more than we initially had,\" Vance said in an interview on the Megyn Kelly Show.He suggested that the \"framework of a future deal\" - unveiled by President Donald Trump last month - would be of benefit to the US.Trump's announcement came as a relief after mounting fear that the US was prepared to use force against fellow Nato ally Denmark to seize its semi-autonomous Arctic island. Trump says Greenland is necessary to defend against possible attacks from Russia and China. Both Denmark and Greenland have said they will not agree to cede sovereignty. Their European allies have rallied to their support.Greenland is sparsely populated but its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks.Trump has claimed without evidence that it is \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\". He has also said the US needs to own Greenland to properly defend it.More than 100 US military personnel are permanently stationed at a US base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.Vance did not give details of what the Trump-announced plan contained that had not been available to the US before, but went on to repeat that the Chinese and the Russians had designs on the Arctic island. \"It's one of the unwritten rules that everybody knows that if the Chinese or the Russians affected one of our critical missile defence systems, we would necessarily defend that. But we're not getting anything for it,\" the US vice-president said.\"Let's rewrite the rules a little bit here and say that if the United States is going to protect the entire world's missile defence system - primarily our own, but other people benefit from it - we should get some benefit from the bargain.\"It is not clear if Vance was referring to Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts because of climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves. Trump has said the \"framework deal\" would involve access to Greenland's mineral resources.The US vice-president went on to accuse European allies of duplicity.\"It's so funny because the Europeans, they're so friendly in private, and they're willing to make a lot of accommodations, and then publicly they attack us.\"\"I'm sorry, it's all bogus,\" Vance said, adding: \"The idea that they haven't made any accommodations or concessions to the United States, it's not true.\"",

    "body": "15 hours agoBrian Wheeler,Political reporterandRianna Croxford,Investigations correspondentUnited States District Court Southern District of New YorkPeter Mandelson's friendship with Jeffery Epstein was known before he became US ambassadorPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said Peter Mandelson misled him about the extent of his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before he was appointed US ambassador.Emails released by the US Department of Justice illustrate the depth of that friendship and appear to confirm that it continued, and even flourished, after Epstein's 2008 conviction.In April 2009, while Epstein was still serving a prison sentence, he messages Lord Mandelson to say: \"ahh... here we go again\".A few minutes later, Lord Mandelson picks up his Blackberry and replies: \"Meaning? At least I am not involved.\"Epstein replies: \"Your romantic complexities\".On the day Epstein is released from jail, in July 2009, the two friends appear to have been in a jubilant mood.\"Free and home,\" Epstein emails the then Labour peer at 08.37am on 22 July.\"How shall we celebrate?\" writes back Lord Mandelson, who at the time was business secretary under Gordon Brown.\"With grace and modesty (those are the names of two strippers),\" Epstein replies.\"From now on, grace and modesty sd [should] be discovered in London,\" Lord Mandelson appears to joke back a few hours later, before adding: \"How is freedom feeling?\"\"She feels fresh, firm and creamy,\" Epstein says.Lord Mandelson responds with two words: \"Naughty boy.\"The tone of the messages from this time is often jokey and indiscreet, occasionally veering into excruciatingly frank.They also suggest that the pair were in frequent phone contact in addition to emails, with one or the other saying \"call me\".The veteran Labour politician appears to have valued his wealthy friend's advice and support, on his political career as well as his private life.When Lord Mandelson tells Epstein he is out of government in May 2010, and is at Labour Party headquarters for a \"farewell\" event for Gordon Brown, the disgraced financier offers a \"big hug\".Lord Mandelson jokingly replies \"you won't leave me will you?\"In November 2009, the pair are discussing pressure on Gordon Brown to resign as prime minister.\"What does tony [sic] say?\" Epstein emails, in what appears to be a reference to Sir Tony Blair, the previous prime minister.\"Talking to him tonight but he has said I sd [should] facilitate not initiate,\" Lord Mandelson writes back.Epstein responds, \"tell gb [Gordon Brown] you see the winds blowing and you are loyal, first second and third […] I don't suggest you tell him to step down…tell him you are his friend and am frustrated as much as he\".\"He will immed[iately] push panic button,\" replies Lord Mandelson.\"He would be stressed not knowing what you really think,\" Epstein responds, before emailing a bawdy joke about Lord Mandelson's judgement.\"Are you sure the backpressure from you[sic] lack of sex is not turning your brain into fois gras,\" Epstein writes.\"It's certainly a serious problem,\" Lord Mandelson seems to joke back. \"Cure coming to London from S'hai [Shanghai] next weekend.\"After his departure from government in May 2010, Lord Mandelson seeks Epstein's opinion on a draft of his memoir, The Third Man, which chronicles his role in New Labour's rise to power and his relationships with Brown and Blair.Epstein seems to be concerned about the impact the book could have on Lord Mandelson's future business plans, which are the subject of several other exchanges.\"I have finished my first read […] The deals you want to be involved in require discretion, trust, handshakes, privacy. This book announces that you are willing to sell all of these for a farthing,\" Epstein wrote as part of an email exchange dated 16 May 2010.\"Your friend, and boss, tony [sic], is more often described as frail, flustered, tired, weak, and Gordon, flawed, demanding, pig-headed, irrationally determined.\"Epstein adds: \"It is not uplifting, it is gossipy and defensive,\" saying he found the draft book \"troubling\" and recommending that Lord Mandelson look at his manuscript again.Lord Mandelson seems put out by his friend's assessment, saying: \"You have read it too fast. It is not those things. But nor is it yet finished.\"By 2012, the friendship between the two men appears to have soured somewhat.In one exchange, Epstein expresses his \"disappointment\" that their relationship has been a \"one way street\".\"… jeffrey can I have, jeffrey can you give jeffrey can you organize… can you call, can you arrange .. you have yet to offer real assistance, sign of gratitude or appreciation. …sorry.\"Lord Mandelson is apparently stung by Epstein's criticism and tells him in a reply \"how much I appreciate your support,\" adding \"during your trials and tribulations I never left your side, I was always there with advice and moral support, and I never turned away\".Lord Mandelson has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "26 minutes agoSimon JonesandRachel Muller HeyndykReutersLife jackets and other belongings seen on the shore of a beach in northern France from where crossings set off The deaths of at least 30 people who drowned while attempting to cross the English Channel in 2021 could have been avoided, an inquiry has found.The dinghy they were travelling on became swamped and capsized in the early hours of 24 November 2021, in what became the deadliest Channel small boat incident on record. Only two people survived, and were found almost 12 hours after they called for help. The inquiry chair Sir Ross Cranston pointed to a \"significant, systemic failure on the part of government\", and said that several of the casualties were preventable. Twenty-seven bodies were found after the boat sank, and another four were confirmed missing. The victims set off from a beach near Dunkirk in France and came from a number of countries, including Iraq, Somali, Ethiopia, Egypt and Afghanistan.Sir Ross's report said HM Coastguard in Dover was placed in an \"intolerable position\", with chronic staff shortages and limited capacity leaving them unable to rescue victims. A surveillance aircraft that should have provided critical intelligence on the number of crossings never launched due to poor weather conditions - and there was no contingency plan, the inquiry found. It was also found that calls and messages from the vessel were missed or not followed up, and search assets were not briefed on the possibility that a dinghy was sinking or that there were people in the water. There was also a widely-held belief that migrants calling from small boats exaggerated the distress, meaning the Coastguard underestimated the emergency. The inquiry said that the deaths could have been prevented, and pointed to three fatal errors: people smugglers overloading the boats, the slow response of French Naval vessel, Flamant, and flaws in the Coastguard's search and rescue operations. Survivors, and the victims' families gave testimonies in the inquiry having waited more than two years for the proceedings to start in March 2024. Many victims survived for several hours in the water, with experts suggesting that more people could have been rescued if operations had continued through to the morning. Witnesses said that during one call at around 01:30, a 16-year-old Iraqi Kurdish boy told the coastguard that everyone was in the water. He was told by the coastguard that help was coming, and to stop calling.By 07:00 on the morning of the 24th the incident had been marked as resolved.\"The practice of small-boat crossings must end. Apart from other reasons, it is imperative to prevent further loss of life,\" Sir Ross said. \"Travelling on board a small, unseaworthy, and overcrowded boat, and crossing one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, is an inherently dangerous activity.'The report recognises the dedication of the Coastguard, Border Force and Royal National Lifeboat Institute.The inquiry accepted that while the Coastguard now has more resources to draw on, \"systemic change is needed to support and strengthen their efforts\".The report recommended the Coastguard gives specific training to its staff about how to deal with small boats, as well as investing in new technology.A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesperson said: \"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of those who died and the survivors of this tragic incident. We will now carefully consider the findings and recommendations of the report. HM Coastguard remains focused on our vital role in safeguarding life at sea.\"Steve Smith from the Care4Calais aid charity said: \"For too long, consecutive governments have dehumanised refugees, and Cranston is confirmation that it has needlessly cost lives.\"He added: \"If the government heeds the findings of Cranston, they will create safe routes for refugees to claim asylum in the UK. Overnight, it will put an end to deaths in the Channel, and save lives.\"That's the justice that those who lost their lives, and their families, deserve.\"A government spokesperson said the capsizing was \"a tragic incident\" and \"sympathies remain with the survivors and the loved ones of those who lost their lives.\"They said while \"crucial improvements\" had been made to Channel responses, \"the business model which sees criminal gangs send people out to sea to risk their lives in unsafe boats without safety equipment must be ended\". The government said it would provide a full response to the inquiry's 18 recommendations, including oversight and resources of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, in due course. French Coastguards have been approached for comment.Additional reporting by Alex Forster and Lebo Diseko",

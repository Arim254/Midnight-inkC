    "body": "3 hours agoEmer MoreauandJemma Crew,Business reportersGetty ImagesThe increasing popularity of weight loss jabs presents an \"opportunity\" for the fast-food chain Leon, its boss believes.John Vincent told the BBC the dishes the brand is serving are the \"sort of food people on weight loss jabs want to eat\".Vincent, an original co-founder of the chain, bought the company back from Asda last year. Last month the firm appointed administrators and announced a major restructuring of its 71 restaurants, which employ 1,000 people.Speaking to the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast, he also set out his plans to revive the chain, which includes opening more restaurants in service stations, airports and train stations, after closing 20 on the High Street.Asked if the rise in weight loss jabs posed a challenge to the chain, Vincent told the BBC he thought \"there is definitely an opportunity for Leon-type food\", which he said was typically low sugar and flavoured with herbs and spices. \"We are actually seeing the food we enjoy eating at Leon, and we used to enjoy serving and we increasingly enjoy serving now, is actually the sort of food people on weight loss jabs want to eat.\"Helping people on the injections get enough protein and maintain their muscle mass \"is just as important as calories I think\", he added.He agreed the impact of the popular appetite suppressing drugs meant Leon would \"definitely\" need to think about portion sizes.Last week, the boss of Greggs said there was \"no doubt\" the drugs have led to people looking for \"smaller portions\", affecting the company's sales.Vincent also spoke about the impact of tax rises, which he said were \"incredibly toxic\" for the hospitality industry.He said the upcoming rises in business rates along with overall cost increases meant the High Street was no longer as profitable. Leon has been losing £10m a year.If taxes on businesses increase further, he said, \"the only people that are going to survive are those selling... food that's not very good quality\".In April, business rates relief for the hospitality sector which came in during Covid will end. At the same time, increases in the rateable value of premises take effect. The Treasury has indicated it will announce further assistance for pubs in the coming days but has faced a backlash from other hospitality businesses over why they are not included. Chancellor Rachel Reeves told a press conference on Wednesday she was \"working with the hospitality sector\". LeonJohn Vincent told the BBC Leon had moved away from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the massesVincent said that traditionally, \"the more fast food units you have, the better the operations, the better the supply chain, the better you can buy, the better your systems can be\".However, he added: \"I'm not sure this is true anymore because of pressure on the market.\"Vincent said he would be initially concentrating on London, plus service stations, train stations and airports, but added the high costs of operating in the capital was making business there \"incredibly difficult\" with \"incredibly high upward-only rents\".He said even though airports in particular take a large slice of a retailer's takings, a 2% profit margin there \"is worth the same as a 6% on the High Street\".\"You might be doing two or three times the revenue in that airport than you might in a High Street location,\" Vincent said.Responding to Vincent's comments, a Treasury spokesperson said: \"We're backing hospitality businesses with a £4.3bn support package to limit bill rises.The spokesperson said this was in addition to \"capping corporation tax at 25%, cutting red tape and taking action on the cost of living to boost high streets\".Aside from rising costs, Vincent feels Leon is struggling because it has drifted from its original mission of good-quality fast food for the masses.The menu started out simple: meatballs, a superfood salad and tapas - relatively healthy offerings at a time when fast food was dominated by burgers, fried chicken and kebabs, Vincent said.But Leon \"lost chutzpah, leadership and confidence\" after it was sold in 2021, which resulted in \"a lack of clarity about what it wants the menu to be\", he said.He has previously said he sympathises with the company's previous owners, because of the challenges that restaurants have faced since the pandemic.\"I think Leon needs to make sense again,\" he said. \"We don't always make sense to people at the moment.\"He plans to bring simplicity back with menu changes this year: \"We do have to, as a brand, realise and remember, we were always about the best food for the most people. \"We were not about posh fast food for posh people. That was never our intention.\"",

    "body": "24 minutes agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanBBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.The Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.",

    "body": "Hundreds of children in care in England are being placed at risk in unregistered homes for months at a time by councils, MPs have warned.A report by the cross-party government spending watchdog said the \"dysfunctional\" care system was \"not working\", with 800 vulnerable children placed in illegal settings for an average of six months each last year.The report said the lack of oversight for unregistered homes meant there was \"no assurance over the quality of care or that children are safe\".Last month, an Ofsted report found councils could often not find places in registered homes to cater for children's needs, with many turning to alternatives which can charge up to £30,000 a week per child.Such homes are not registered with or inspected by Ofsted - which is a criminal offence - but it can only issue warning letters to operators.This practice is expected to change under new legislation as part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, with the inspectorate given stronger powers to impose fines on the unregistered homes.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) report, published on Friday, said councils were facing rising costs as a result of a \"dysfunctional market where the need for homes in certain areas, particularly for children with complex needs, has exceeded the number of places available\".Conservative Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the PAC chairman, said the current system was \"forcing\" councils to routinely \"reach for solutions which will see our nation's children regularly put at risk\".The report said councils did not take the decision to use unregistered provision \"lightly\" and only did so \"when no registered settings are available\".It also said Ofsted had introduced targets to shorten the time it takes to register new homesBut it added that the Department for Education (DfE) expected it would take two years for the improvements to \"take effect and address the shortages of places that contributes to local authorities using unregistered homes\".The number of registered care homes in England reached a record high in 2024/25, at 4,010. But in its annual report, published in December, Ofsted pointed out that many were not in the areas where the needs were highest, while there were also ongoing issues with the affordability and suitability of places.It said the lack of available places in legitimate settings had led to a shadow market of illegal care homes which charge \"exorbitant fees\".A recent report from independent public spending watching, the National Audit Office, found the cost of children's residential care in England had nearly doubled in five years, to £3.1bn in the year to March 2024.The PAC report also noted that almost half (49%) of children in care in England were being placed in homes more than 20 miles away from their original family home.It said the government was relying on more foster carers to reduce demand for children's residential care, but had \"yet to address the significant challenges\" to boost numbers.A DfE spokesperson said the government had inherited a children's social care system \"unable to meet the needs\" of vulnerable children, but it was \"taking action\" to reform the sector. \"Running an unregistered children's home is illegal and those who seek to profit from children's social care illegally will face serious consequences,\" they added.",

    "body": "Jet to return TikTok star only option, police say57 minutes agoStuart MaisnerSouth EastGetty ImagesHSTikkyTokky, real name Harrison Sullivan, has a large following on social mediaExtraditing a TikTok influencer on a private jet from Spain at a cost of nearly £16,000 was the only viable option, a police force has said.Harrison Sullivan, 24, known as HSTikkyTokky, had to be repatriated to the UK after avoiding police custody for almost 12 months following a car crash in Virginia Water, Surrey, in March 2024.A judge sitting at Staines Magistrates' Court on Thursday deemed the use of the private jet \"not necessary or proportionate\".Justifying its decision in a new statement, Surrey Police said it was based on a risk assessment by the NCA's National Extradition Unit \"after all other options had been considered and were unfortunately not viable to mitigate the perceived risks\".The details of the risk assessment were not disclosed in court on Thursday.Surrey Police said Sullivan's extradition to the UK was \"imperative\" for the safety of the county's roads.It said: \"Surrey Police is committed to reducing the number of fatal and serious injury collisions on our roads and we will hold people to account who endanger the lives of others.\"The manner of Sullivan's driving was incredibly dangerous.\"The force said the influencer was driving at 70mph in a 40mph speed zone in his McLaren.Sullivan was handed a one-year suspended custodial sentence at Staines Magistrates' Court in November after pleading guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance.Surrey PoliceSullivan was driving a purple McLaren on the A30 when it crashedThe social media star has also been disqualified from driving for two years, will have an electronic tag for three months, and is expected to complete 300 hours of unpaid work and 30 days of rehabilitation.The total costs to both Surrey Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to bring Sullivan back to the UK after the crash amounted to £28,350.27, the hearing on Thursday was told.But Judge Cooper brought the total bill down to £17,320.27, ordering Sullivan to pay £8,050.27 in costs to Surrey Police, and £9,270 to the CPS respectively.When prosecutor Kane Alexander told the judge there had been concerns Sullivan - a fitness influencer - could be recognised by members of the public on a commercial plane, Judge Cooper said: \"It seems that Mr Sullivan travels around on planes with impunity without too much risk to himself, so I don't really understand.\"Referring to the costs incurred throughout the investigation, defence solicitor Shalin Sood said: \"It's not rocket science trying to locate where Mr Sullivan is – he livestreams every day.\"Additional reporting from PA Media.

    "body": "2 hours agoKate Whannelpolitical reporterThe Liberal Democrats have proposed introducing film-style age ratings to limit which social media apps children can access.Under the party's plan, platforms that use addictive algorithmic feeds or host \"inappropriate content\" would be restricted to users over 16 years old, while sites with \"graphic violence or pornography\" would be rated 18-plus. This approach, the Lib Dems have argued, would \"avoid the unintended consequences\" of banning all under-16s from using social media, as advocated by the Conservatives. In recent days, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated he is open to the idea of an outright ban, telling reporters that \"all options are on the table\". He said he would be watching to see how a ban recently introduced in Australia was working. The new Australian law, which came into force in December, requires certain social media companies including Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, X and TikTok to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep children off their platforms. In order to ascertain a user's age, the companies can use government-issued identity documents, face or voice recognition or analyse online behaviour to estimate a person's age. The Conservatives have said that, if elected, they would follow the same approach as the Australian government and ban under-16s from accessing social media. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The internet is a Wild West, social media in particular, we don't want children to be on there.\" However, Victoria Collins, the Liberal Democrats' science and technology spokesperson, said the proposal for a \"blanket ban\" was a \"blunt instrument that doesn't work in a digital age\". She said it showed Conservatives \"just don't trust parents\".The Liberal Democrats have argued that their \"tailored approach\" would allow governments to \"quickly categorise\" newly-emerging social media platforms based on the addictiveness or harmfulness of their content. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said: \"Our message to social media giants is clear: if your platform spreads harmful content or relies on addictive and harmful algorithms, you should not be allowed anywhere near our children.\"This issue cannot be kicked down the road any longer.\"The party says that under its proposal, apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would be classified as unsuitable for under-16s \"unless these companies fundamentally rewrite their code to remove addictive algorithmic feeds and inappropriate content\". The age ratings would be enforced by media regulator Ofcom, who could issue fines for companies that do not comply. Peers in the House of Lords could get a chance to vote on the proposal next week, when the Liberal Democrats seek to add it as an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill.During the same debate, a group of cross-party peers will push a different amendment which would prevent under-16s from accessing social media. It has been tabled by Lord Nash, a Conservative former education minister, but is jointly-sponsored by Baroness Benjamin, the Liberal Democrat peer and former children's TV presenter; the Labour peer Baroness Berger and Baroness Cass, an independent member of the House of Lords, who is a paediatrician.Those involved in the amendment are optimistic it will pass.The NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) has urged  peers to oppose a total ban saying \"action is needed but a complex problem requires more than a blanket solution. Bans are not the answer.\"The charity is backing the \"film ratings\" approach, arguing that children and young people should be protected but not \"shut out from the online world and the benefits it can offer for connection, fun, learning and support\". The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of Molly Russell who took her own life at the age of 14 after being exposed to images of self harm and suicide on social media - has also expressed concerns about a social media ban.The charity has warned of \"unintended consequences\" including \"pushing harm to unregulated areas\". Some social media companies have argued that a ban would be difficult to implement and easy for users to circumvent. Apps such as TikTok and Instagram generally restrict accounts to those aged 13 or over.Some of the big platforms also put in place protections for teenagers.For example, teen accounts on Snapchat are private by default and public accounts are only available to those who are 16 or over.  Snapchat has said it will comply with the ban in Australia but warned that \"disconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn't make them safer - it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps\".

    "body": "Work to fix hospitals built using unsafe concrete will not be completed in time to meet the government's target, a new report has warned.Seven hospitals built using Raac, or reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete, were prioritised for remedial work last year, with the government setting a deadline of 2030.The new buildings are now expected to open in 2032 and 2033 - but some are already facing pressure to meet the revised timetable, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.In a number of hospitals, roofs are being supported by metal props and some areas have been closed as unsafe.Meanwhile, affected health trusts face huge maintenance bills to keep their aging buildings safe.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the original New Hospitals Programme - 40 new hospitals by 2030 - promises \"that were never going to be met\".  In January 2025 he revised the scheme, prioritising 20 of the projects, including Raac hospitals, with more funding and later dates of completion.The NAO report says the 2025 review did put the programme on a \"more realistic, stable, long-term footing\". Standardising the design for some of the new buildings should speed up delivery and reduce costs, for example. But some of the new dates for completion have slipped. Torbay, Kettering and Musgrove Park hospitals are all delayed – they are estimated to be open nine to ten years later than under the previous plan.Raac is less durable than reinforced concrete as the \"bubbly\" structure can let water in, weakening the building material which can crumble and collapse. All of the seven \"prioritised\" schemes to replace Raac now won't be completed until 2032-33 and with \"significant operational and clinical risk and cost \", says the NAO.In the meantime, hospitals including the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds and The Queen Elizabeth Hospitals in Kings Lynn are facing huge maintenance bills to keep their sites open. By 2025 the seven hospitals will have required more than £500 million of investment to prevent structural failure.The NHS aims to remove all Raac concrete from its estate by 2035. The Department for Health and Social Care says so far there are 20 sites where it has been eradicated and that it is investing £1.6 billion across the next four years. Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown says the delays in addressing crumbling Raac must now be addressed \"as a matter of urgency.\"But the report warns that there is a tight construction schedule overall with little contingency in the next five years, so delivery dates could slip further.Mr Tim Mitchell, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: \"A steadier plan is better than drifting, but patients cannot wait a decade for capacity that we need now. \"NHS trusts will be pouring scarce funds into patching up old buildings for longer, when that money should be used to create extra operating theatres, securing ring‑fenced beds and making sure that there is enough staff to run them.\"A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We've confirmed a sustainable funding plan and an achievable timetable to deliver all schemes in the programme. We are now getting on with building these much-needed facilities as quickly as possible.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

    "body": "8 minutes agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to Chins is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent month and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner, recording more than C$118bn ($85bn; £63bn) in two-way merchandise trade in 2024. That's a long way behind the US, Canada's closest ally, which traded more than $761bn (£568bn) worth of goods with Ottawa in 2024.But economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney, who said ahead of his visit that Canada was focused on building a \"more competitive, sustainable and independent economy\" in the face of \"global trade disruption\".Carney, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

    "body": "A bipartisan group of members of the US Congress is visiting Denmark in what is seen as a show of support in the face of increasing pressure from President Donald Trump for the US to annex Greenland - a semi-autonomous region of Denmark in the Arctic.The 11-member delegation is due to meet MPs as well as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.The visit comes days after high-level talks in Washington failed to dissuade Trump from his plans.He insists Greenland is vital for US security - and that Denmark cannot defend it against possible Russian or Chinese attacks. Both Denmark and Greenland say they are opposed to a US takeover.Greenland is sparsely-populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But Trump has said the US needs to \"own\" it to defend it properly. He has consistently offered to buy it off - an offer rejected by Denmark and Greenland - whilst mooting the possibility of seizing it by force. Denmark has warned that military action would spell the end of Nato - the trans-Atlantic defence alliance where the US is the most influential partner. Nato works on the principle that allies have to aid each other in case of attack from outside - it has never faced an option where one member would use force against another. European allies have rallied to Denmark's support.They have also said the Arctic region is equally important to them and that its security should be a joint Nato responsibility - with the US involved.  To this end, several countries including France,  Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have sent a limited number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.French President Emmanuel Macron said \"land, air, and sea assets\" would soon be sent. The US Congressional delegation includes senators and members of the US House of Representatives who are fervent supporters of Nato.It is led by Senator Chris Coons who said earlier this week that \"we need to draw closer to our allies, not drive them away\".Though Coons and the majority of the delegation are Democratic opponents of Trump, the group includes Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, too.Democratic and Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation to stop Trump seizing Greenland by force. A Republican congressman has also introduced a rival bill in support of the plan to annex the island.",

    "body": "I didn't give up, I let go. How I came to terms with not having children11 hours agoLucy HookerCaroline StaffordTry hard enough, we are often told, and eventually you'll get what you want.But sometimes the hardest - and bravest - thing to do, is to stop trying.After years of hoping to start a family, including the painful rollercoaster of fertility treatment and a devastating miscarriage on Christmas day, Caroline Stafford, found the only way to find some kind of peace again was to accept it was not going to happen and to build a different future. But that meant overcoming what she calls the \"don't give up\" narrative. Like many people, Caroline and her husband Gareth, who she met at school, took it almost for granted they would have children in due course. \"We spend all our lives trying not to get pregnant. I just assumed as soon as I wasn't trying not to, I would,\" she says.Caroline StaffordCaroline and Gareth met at school in NottinghamshireNearly one in five women in the UK do not have children.That can be for a variety of reasons, including personal choice. But some simply find that the family life they had imagined, does not happen.After a year of failing to conceive Caroline and Gareth went to see the GP. A round of IVF in the UK was followed by more rounds abroad - a process of anxious appointments, medications and injections.At the same time she watched as her friends fell pregnant and had babies of their own.\"We were absolutely delighted for them, but the truth was, it was the worst thing to hear,\" she tells Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett.For anyone in Caroline's situation, simply seeing a parent with a pram can be painful, the source of a gnawing envy.That feeling ate away at her, changing who she was.\"Your world view becomes smaller and often more negative.\"I started to not really like how I was feeling towards other people,\" she says.Friends would tell her not to worry, it would happen in the end, or that she should stop trying, because then she would fall pregnant.Then in November six years ago, out of the blue, her friends were proved right.  Not trying seemed to have worked.She and Gareth had been living in a big farmhouse, in Rutland. They had just moved to a small cottage in a village, a kind of acceptance on some level that the large family they had been dreaming of was not going to be.As the festive season approached they began to share the good news with friends and family.Then on Christmas morning Gareth went out to deal with the dairy herd. By the time he was back she had lost the baby.\"It was the timing, the way it happened. It just felt so cruel.\"Her memories of that day are hazy.But both of them feel that it was the turning point.Caroline StaffordTaking up long-distance running allowed Caroline to change her relationship with her body\"It felt like we both knew it was time to begin to try to let go,\" she says, but that in itself required a huge effort.\"I didn't know at the point whether I was right. But we just began to tread forward,\" she says.She threw herself into work. She had started her business, selling biscuits stamped with personalised messages, during their second round of IVF.At first if people said her business was her baby, she would bristle. These days she finds it comforting. After all, it is something she has nurtured for a decade.She now has a team of 14 in the bakery, sends her biscuits all over the country, and has partnered with a mail order flower firm.For Gareth letting go has meant rethinking his work altogether. He is about to start a new job as a greenkeeper at his golf club.People do ask her if she considered adopting, but she says it \"wasn't the path that we chose.\"\"Adoption isn't just another way to become a parent. It's a major decision.A decade of IVF had changed Caroline's relationship with her own body.\"I was focusing on this one thing it couldn't do,\" she says.She started long distance running and instead of berating her body over its failure, she started celebrating what it could do instead. She has now done four half and full marathons, while Gareth is on his sixth.\"I love the life I've got. \"I don't feel that direct sense of loss any more. It's a different, a softer kind of sadness now.\"She has found a greater sense of peace as time passes. Even that comes though with pangs of guilt, wondering whether coming to terms with her childlessness, means she did not want it enough, or try hard enough.She knows that's still the \"don't give up\" message, nagging at her conscience. \"We're taught growing up that effort equals results, but it's often not how it works.\"Life can still have meaning and it can still have purpose, even when it looks so drastically different from what you expected.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by pregnancy issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help.All episodes of Ready to Talk with Emma Barnett are available on BBC Sounds.

    "body": "12 hours agoNardine Saad and Christal HayesLos AngelesActor Timothy Busfield has made his first court appearance after turning himself in on criminal charges that he allegedly sexually abused two boys on the set of a TV series filmed in New Mexico, prosecutors say.The Emmy-winning actor, who starred in Thirtysomething and The West Wing, was taken into custody in Albuquerque on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse that police allege happened on the set of Fox's crime drama The Cleaning Lady.Busfield, 68, strenuously denied the allegations through his lawyer.\"The claims being made against Tim are completely false, and we will fight this to the end until the truth prevails,\" the lawyer, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said.Stein said the actor, who is also known for his roles in the baseball film Field of Dreams and the comedy thriller Revenge of the Nerds, was being accused as an act of revenge after the children had been terminated from the series, which angered their mother. During a media conference on Thursday, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman said that Busfield made an initial court appearance on Wednesday and a judge ordered that he remain in custody. The case is now being transferred to district court and a hearing has been set for 20 January to determine whether Busfield should be released on bail pending trial.\"Our priority is to protect the rights of everyone involved,\" Bregman said at the news conference, urging anyone with information to contact law enforcement.In a warrant for Busfield's arrest, prosecutors say the parents of boys allege that Busfield groomed and sexually abused the youngsters while working on set for The Cleaning Lady, which Busfield both directs and executive produces. It airs on Fox in the US. In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. \"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. \"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. \"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.",

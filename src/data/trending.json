    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Thomas Tuchel has won nine of his first 10 games in charge of England - the only other England manager to pick up as many wins in his first 10 matches is Glenn Hoddle in 1996-97 (also W9 L1)ByChief football writerEngland completed a flawless World Cup qualifying campaign with victory in Albania, giving head coach Thomas Tuchel an outstanding record of eight wins from eight with 22 goals scored and none conceded.It concludes phase one of the job Tuchel was brought in to do by the Football Association after succeeding Sir Gareth Southgate. Namely win the World Cup.Tuchel's planning now moves to the next stage - so what are the major issues he must ponder before he names his World Cup squad as he looks to end a 60-year wait for a major men's trophy?Bellingham or Rogers?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, England's win over Albania saw Jude Bellingham start his first international since JuneThe rivalry between childhood friends Jude Bellingham and Morgan Rogers for England's number 10 jersey provides an intriguing sub-plot to Tuchel's World Cup build-up.Tuchel stresses the battle can remain friendly, although it has almost been stoked and encouraged by the German, so keen is he to create edge and competition in his squad.Along with Declan Rice, Rogers is the only other England player to feature in all 10 games under Tuchel.Rogers took his chance impressively when Bellingham was absent after shoulder surgery, then Tuchel kept faith with Aston Villa's 23-year old after he decided against giving one of the global superstars in England's squad an instant recall.After a 25-minute cameo as a substitute against Serbia at Wembley, Bellingham started in Tirana, delivering a bit of everything that makes him such a passionate point of discussion.Bellingham showed his range of passing, made trademark driving runs, almost scored in the second half – but also demonstrated petulance when he was shown a yellow card for a foul committed after he lost possession, then looked unhappy at being substituted, which Tuchel said he will review.The accomplished manner in which Rogers has taken to the England stage has given Tuchel a wonderful conundrum, while the searing heat at next summer's World Cup means he is likely to deploy \"starters\" and \"finishers\", Bellingham and Rogers can do both.Rogers has an avid admirer in Tuchel. He has made 10 appearances under him, starting six games and playing for a total of 531 minutes. Bellingham has started four, playing 374 minutes in total.Tuchel will not duck big decisions. He will not indulge in star systems or simply pack his team with the biggest names.So who will start?For all Rogers' impressive work, Bellingham has proved he can deliver game-changing moments at the highest level, his status also confirmed when Albania's Kristjan Asllani asked him to swap shirts at half-time rather than risk leaving it until the end.Phil Foden will be in Tuchel's thinking, with the German saying he does not see the Manchester City forward as a winger, and instead \"as a mix between a nine and a 10\".Chelsea's Cole Palmer also has the ability and class to force his way into the squad if he can recover from his groin injury.In reality, however, it looks like a choice between Bellingham and Rogers.Bellingham's greater experience of the rarefied air of major competitions will surely just give him the edge when Tuchel names his team for England's first World Cup game.Kane indispensable – but who are the alternatives?Harry Kane maintained his magnificent England record with the double in Albania that ensured they finished World Cup qualifying with a win.Kane may be 32 but looks at his peak, a master marksman as well as the complete player, willing to drop deep to do dirty work but still always arriving at the sharp end with perfect timing when goals are required.Former England defender Conor Coady told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't want to think of an England without Harry Kane. What he brings to this team is unbelievable.\"The way he keeps on producing these numbers is unbelievable and it is credit to him. He is the first on and last off the training pitch. He is our biggest hope going into next year.\"Kane is indispensable, England's record scorer with 78 goals in 112 internationals.If he is not playing the drop off is deep. Kane's potential deputies are all perfectly capable, but they are not Harry Kane.An injury to his captain will be Tuchel's biggest fear, particularly as ready-made replacements are hardly forming an orderly queue.Image source, EPAImage caption, Harry Kane has now scored 78 goals in 112 games for EnglandBrighton's 34-year-old veteran Danny Welbeck has been touted. It is testimony to the enduring skill of the striker, who last played for England seven years ago, but also suggests the cupboard is worryingly bare.Tuchel said Welbeck was \"very close\" to a call-up for England's latest camp, but added: \"I felt even without knowing him I know what he can give us. Do I really need to see this in November?\"Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins has been used, although Ivan Toney has disappeared from view after bizarrely being summoned from Saudi Arabia to play two minutes in the friendly against Senegal last June.Marcus Rashford can play as a striker, while Newcastle United's Anthony Gordon has played there for his club, but is not a natural fit.Foden has been mentioned as part of a tactical tweak if England are in need of a main striker, but the bottom line is they still have no-one who comes close to Kane's class.As Coady stated, England without Harry Kane at the World Cup is unthinkable.Tuchel ponders defensive questionsImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, John Stones brings class, experience and versatility to England's defence - so will he start at the World Cup?John Stones showed his class and versatility in a hybrid role in Tirana, ostensibly in his usual central defensive position but stepping into midfield when England were in possession. It is a ploy he can carry out with comfort, potentially giving Tuchel's strategy an extra dimension.Former England defender Stephen Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"This game against Albania is cementing why John Stones is so vital to this England squad. He is conducting the play from a centre-back position and a centre midfield position. Really impressive.\"It is likely to be a more orthodox back four at the World Cup, so it looks down to two from Stones, Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa and Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi in central defence.Stones may have the edge with his vast experience, while Konsa and Guehi, who both missed the win in Albania through injury, have grown as internationals.Coady said: \"I think it's really close. Konsa has been outstanding. For me, it's Stones and Guehi's to lose. To keep Stones fit for the World Cup is absolutely huge.\"Bayer Leverkusen's Jarell Quansah made his long-awaited senior debut against Albania and impressed as he started centrally before moving out wide.Tuchel must also decide on his left-back with an exciting trio of youngsters leading the race.Arsenal's Myles Lewis-Skelly, Tottenham's Djed Spence and Manchester City's Nico O'Reilly have all been handed senior debuts by Tuchel, but it is O'Reilly who started and impressed in the final two qualifiers.Newcastle United's Tino Livramento, currently out injured, may be in the lead for that place, with Lewis-Skelly left out by Tuchel because of lack of game time this season. O'Reilly may have edged ahead of Spence after this camp.It is still a position up for grabs.Will Rashford start on the left?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Marcus Rashford assisted Harry Kane seven minutes after coming on against AlbaniaBukayo Saka has nailed down the right wing slot, so who will play on the opposite side?Marcus Rashford left Tuchel with something to remember him by from England's World Cup qualifier with a superb cross for Kane's second goal in Tirana.Rashford has made his case, but Gordon has also impressed, while Tuchel is a big fan of Arsenal's Noni Madueke, currently out injured.Jack Grealish has done well on loan at Everton, but he simply has too much competition to fight his way past and has not featured for the Three Lions since October 2024.Eberechi Eze started against Albania and can play on the left or as a number 10, though he is not at the forefront of the conversations to compete with Bellingham and Rogers in that role.If Rashford wanted to give Tuchel food for thought, his superb cross for Kane to complete his double gave the head coach plenty to digest.",

This week, Amol speaks to Sir Nick Clegg — former UK deputy prime minister and former president of global affairs at Meta — about the power and responsibility of big tech companies. Sir Nick argues that breaking them up won’t solve the problem of their digital dominance, calling instead for greater regulation and user control. \nHe discusses how technology shapes young people’s lives, warning against moral panic whilst calling for stronger age-appropriate safeguards and phone-free schools. And with rare candour, Sir Nick offers an insider’s perspective on how Silicon Valley really works — and why governments, not tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg, must ultimately set the rules. \nHe also talks about politics and philosophy, arguing that true liberalism — rooted in reason, openness, and the belief in evidence over emotion — remains vital in an increasingly polarised world. \n(00:03:20) Concerns about the impact of AI \n(00:07:00) The power paradox and network effects \n(00:06:11) Children and smartphones \n(00:22:17) Social media and political polarisation \n(00:34:00) What’s Mark Zuckerberg really like? \n(00:37:56) Why tech bosses are not moral leaders \n(00:41:36) Why he left Meta \n(00:44:10) The future of technology and power \n(00:49:26) The race for AI ‘supremacy’ between the US and China \n(00:52:00) Preparing for this new digital world \n(00:53:11) Why has politics changed so much since he was deputy prime minister? \n(00:57:55) Is liberalism weak? \n(01:01:20) What’s next for Sir Nick Clegg? \n(01:05:16) Amol’s reflections \nGET IN TOUCH \n* WhatsApp: 0330 123 9480 \n* Email: radical@bbc.co.uk \nEpisodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are released every Thursday and you can also watch them on BBC iPlayer: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m002f1d0/radical-with-amol-rajan \nAmol Rajan is a presenter of the Today programme on BBC Radio 4.

    "body": "12 hours agoYasmin RufoGetty ImagesYou are not going to like all your children's friends and sooner or later, your child will bring home a friend you just don't warm to. Maybe they're rude, overconfident or have a habit of helping themselves to snacks without asking. Or maybe it's deeper than that and you feel they bring out the worst in your child.It's easy to just tell your child they can't hang out with a friend, but that often won't solve the problem.Parenting coach Sue Atkins and mum-of-four and comedian Ria Lina share three ways you can navigate this without driving your own kid away.1. Consider why you don't like themIs it something serious like disrespect, bullying or risky behaviour, or is it just that the child rubs you up the wrong way?Atkins says it's worth doing a little self-audit before reacting as it's important to separate what's annoying from what's harmful.If it's a genuine risk like dangerous behaviour or bullying then it's time to step in more firmly, but if the issue is something like manners, you can model the behaviour you want to see.This is something Lina, whose comedy is often about the trials and tribulations of raising four children, often does. \"When a child is under my care, they follow my standards,\" she explains. \"I tell my children off for putting their feet on bus seats and if other kids under my care are doing that, then I'll tell them to take their feet off too.\"Lina says that the reason you may not like your children's friends is often because of a \"clash of values\" with other parents.\"I've had moments where I thought, this kid makes my kid worse but often it's not really that child's fault.\"For example, I don't allow gun play at home at all, no finger guns or playing with toy guns, but lots of boys do that and that's caused tension when I've told my kids they couldn't join in.\"Sometimes talking to the child's parents can help find a middle ground that both parents are happy with, she says.2. Talk, don't banGetty ImagesIdentify the behaviour you don't like in your child's friend and talk to them about it directlyThe worst thing you can do is just ban your child from seeing a friend as \"you're not helping them engage in better friendships nor are you explaining to them why they can't spend time with that child,\" says Atkins.Being too heavy-handed can \"backfire and your child will probably hang out with that friend more just to spite you.\"You should ask your child why they like that friend - what do they have in common? What do they enjoy doing together?Listening to them share this doesn't mean you approve of their friendship but it helps build trust between you.\"When you talk, choose your moment carefully,\" says Atkins. \"Watch your tone and body language because if you go in aggressive or judgemental, they'll shut down.\"You want to build bridges, not walls.\"Lina says that it's important to tell your child \"you don't approve of a particular behaviour and you don't want to see them copying it,\" she adds. \"That way you're not stopping the friendship or forbidding the interaction but you're drawing a line about what shouldn't be repeated or endorsed.\"3. Widen the circleGetty ImagesJoining a sports group can be a good way for children to meet new people If your child seems stuck in a friendship you're uneasy about, subtly expand their social world.\"Introduce other friends into the mix,\" suggests Atkins. \"Invite cousins over, make them join a sports club or try after-school activities - anything that helps them meet new people.\"It's also important to remember that not every friendship is forever and kids often move through phases, so it's best to see how the friendship changes over a few weeks or months before intervening.\"Sometimes it's just a friend for the summer holidays or it's a teenage kid trying to spite you,\" says Atkins.The best thing you can do is model the kind of friendships you hope your child will form.Talking to them about your own relationships can show your child what respect, kindness and healthy boundaries look like and in turn, they are more likely to mimic that.",

    "body": "51 minutes agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem and Raffi Berg,LondonThe UN Security Council is expected to vote on a draft resolution backing Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza.The text, submitted by the US, would give a mandate for the deployment of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) and to set up transitional governance there.The US says multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute to the ISF, though it is unclear whether it would be required to ensure Hamas disarms or function as a peacekeeping force.Its formation is a central plank of Trump's 20-point plan which last month brought a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in their two-year war.The draft also raises the possibility of a Palestinian state - something Israel strongly opposes.There have been intense negotiations over the draft text of the resolution, with Washington warning that any vote against it could lead to a return to fighting with Israel.As well as authorising an ISF, which it says would work with Israel and Egypt - Gaza's southern neighbour - the draft also calls for creation of a newly trained Palestinian police in Gaza. Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.According to reports on the latest draft, part of the ISF's role would be to work on the \"permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups\" – including Hamas – as well as protecting civilians and humanitarian aid routes.This would require Hamas to hand over its weapons - something it is meant to do under Trump's peace plan. But in a statement published overnight, Hamas called the draft resolution \"dangerous\" and an \"attempt to subject the Gaza Strip to international authority\".It said Palestinian factions rejected any clause relating to the disarmament of Gaza or harming \"the Palestinian people's right to resistance\".The statement also rejected any foreign military presence inside the Gaza Strip, saying it would constitute a violation of Palestinian sovereignty.The draft goes on to endorse the formation of a Board of Peace, expected to be headed by President Trump, to oversee a body of Palestinian technocrats that will temporarily administer Gaza and take charge of its redevelopment.Following pressure from key Arab states, the latest text mentions a possible future Palestinian state, though without calling for one as the goal.Even so, the inclusion of such a reference drew sharp reaction from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after allies in his governing coalition criticised the draft, including threatening to leave the government if Netanyahu did not push back.\"Regarding a Palestinian state,\" he said on Sunday, \"our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory west of the Jordan [River], this opposition is existing, valid, and has not changed one bit.\"Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas which had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

I'm not going to hold my breath, but this is a step in the right direction.\"In May, South Western Railway launched its own, separate, \"superfast\" wi-fi rollout for its trains between Earlsfield and Basingstoke, using trackside poles and antennas to create a bespoke 5G rail network.",

    "body": "A court in Singapore has sentenced an Australian man to nine days in prison for grabbing Hollywood star Ariana Grande at a movie premiere.Johnson Wen, 26, was found guilty of being a public nuisance over the high-profile incident last Thursday at the Asia premiere for Wicked: For Good. Videos posted on social media show Wen jumping the barriers, charging at a visibly shocked Grande and grabbing her shoulders while jumping up and down.The incident sparked outrage in Singapore, where many called for the arrest and deportation of Wen, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events.Several accused him of \"re-traumatising\" Grande. The pop star turned actress has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.In Wen's trial on Monday, the court heard he had attempted to intrude on the movie premiere twice, Singaporean media reports.Moments after he grabbed Grande, her co-star Cynthia Erivo forcibly pried him off and security staff escorted him out.He then made a second attempt to jump the barricades. Security staff stopped him and this time pinned him down.Wen later posted videos of the incident on his social media accounts thanking Grande and stating that he was \"free\".Police in Singapore arrested him the next day and charged him with public nuisance. Wen pleaded guilty.Prosecutors sought a week's jail for Wen, arguing that he was a \"serial intruder\" who publicised his behaviour to gain popularity online.Wen has posted videos of himself disrupting concerts by Katy Perry and The Weeknd, and invading the pitch at various sporting events. Australian media have reported he is banned from some stadiums and has incurred large fines.Wen, who was not represented in the Singapore court, told the judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\".Under Singapore's laws against public nuisance, Wen could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$2,000 (£1,167; $1,537), or both.Grande has not commented on the case, while continuing to appear in public at events in Los Angeles over the weekend.But two days after the incident, Erivo appeared to allude to it when she spoke about her relationship with Grande while making the movie, saying: \"We have come through some stuff in our lives, our daily workings... even this last week, let's be honest.\"",

    "body": "30 minutes agoArunoday Mukharji and Mir Sabbir,in Dhaka, and Ewan SomervilleBangladesh's former prime minister has been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity over her crackdown on student-led protests which led to her ousting.Sheikh Hasina was found guilty of allowing lethal force to be used against protesters, 1,400 of whom died during the unrest last year.Hasina was tried in absentia by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, having been exiled in India since she was forced from power in July 2024.Prosecutors accused her of being behind hundreds of killings during the protests. Hasina has denied all charges, calling the trial \"biased and politically motivated\".The verdict marks a pivotal moment for Bangladesh, as the protests unleashed anger over years of repression. Families of those killed and injured had called for tough penalties. Reacting to the verdict in a five-page statement, Hasina said the death penalty was the interim government's way of \"nullifying [her party] the Awami League as a political force\" and that she was proud of her government's record on human rights.\"I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where the evidence can be weighed and tested fairly.\"The capital, Dhaka, where the tribunal took place, was under tightened security ahead of the verdict on Monday, with many of Hasina's critics staging a rally and cheering as the verdict was read. The city has seen a recent spike in unrest, with dozens of bombs exploded and buses set on fire in the days leading up to the verdict.At least one bomb explosion was reported in Dhaka on Monday morning, with no casualties reported, local police official Jisanul Haque told the BBC.The student-led uprising last year started with demands to abolish government job quotas but morphed into a wider anti-government movement.UN human rights investigators said in a report in February that the approximately 1,400 deaths could amount to \"crimes against humanity\".The report documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture.Leaked audio of one of Hasina's phone calls verified by BBC Eye earlier this year suggested she had authorised the use of \"lethal weapons\" in July 2024. The audio was played in court during the trial.Ahead of the verdict, family members of those killed during the protests told the BBC they wanted Hasina to be punished severely.Ramjan Ali, whose brother was shot dead in July 2024, said he wanted \"exemplary punishment\" for Hasina and others who have \"committed acts of vengeance and abused their power\".Lucky Akther, whose husband was killed near Dhaka in August 2024, said she wanted Hasina's sentence to be \"carried out before the election\".\"Only then the families of those killed [in the protests] will find peace in their hearts.\"Since Hasina's ousting, an interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus has taken charge. A parliamentary election is scheduled for February 2026.However, the Awami League, Hasina's political party, was banned by Bangladesh's interim government in May.Hasina warned last month that if the party's candidates were banned from standing in the upcoming election, millions would boycott the vote.The verdict now poses a diplomatic challenge for India and Bangladesh. Dhaka has formally requested her extradition but so far India has shown no willingness to comply.Hasina's state-appointed lawyer Mohammad Amir Hossain said he was \"sad [and wishes] the verdict had been different\".\"I even cannot appeal because my clients are absent; that's why I am sad,\" he added.Last week, Hasina's lawyers said they had filed an urgent appeal to the UN raising serious fair trial and due process issues at the ICT.Hasina was tried alongside her former home minister and police chief.While the sentence offers some closure to families of killed in the protests, it may do little to soothe the country's political divisions.\"The anger against Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League has not subsided,\" Shireen Huq, a Dhaka-based rights activists told the BBC. \"Neither she nor the party has apologised or shown any remorse for the killings of hundreds of people.\"She said \"It makes it difficult for the party to be accepted by a majority of people in this country.\"Ms Huq added that the punishment was not closure for the families of those killed and injured.\"We work with several people who lost their limbs forever, they are amputees now, due to the crackdown. They will never be able to forgive her.\"David Bergman, a journalist and a long-time Bangladesh watcher, said the \"very nature of the conviction could make it even more difficult\" for Awami League to become a normal feature of Bangladeshi politics again.This may change if \"there is some kind of apology and a distancing from Sheikh Hasina and the old leadership\", he said.",

The Refugee Council, which supports asylum-seekers, says making refugee status temporary is both \"highly impractical\" as well as \"inhumane\".Will Labour MPs vote for it?The home secretary's team are delighted at the newspaper headlines and TV coverage their announcements have secured in recent days, yet they know that was the easy bit.Persuading Labour MPs from all wings of the party to vote en masse for the plans is a far bigger challenge.Backbench frustration over winter fuel payments and welfare reform led to embarrassing government U-turns. Will restive Labour MPs try to shift government policy yet again?That may depend on whether a politician's constituency is under threat from Reform UK and Conservatives on the right, or the Liberal Democrats and Greens on the left.Some ministers are already raising concerns about Mahmood's proposals in private, and sceptical MPs have started to speak out in public.Rachael Maskell, a prominent critic of the government's botched welfare reforms, told me many of her colleagues are \"seriously concerned\". She said the government is going in \"completely the wrong direction\" on immigration and its plans to change how human rights law is applied in the UK are a \"step too far\".Another sceptical Labour MP, Brian Leishman, told me he had \"big reservations\" about the proposals, and cautioned ministers against \"trying to copy Farage and Reform who only want to demonise people\".Fast-track deportations to be announced as part of asylum reformsIllegal migration tearing UK apart, Mahmood saysUK set to limit refugees to temporary staysTo minimise the prospect of parliamentary opposition, Mahmood has been meeting groups of Labour MPs in recent weeks to make what her allies call \"the persuasive moral case for reform\".But privately they concede that it will be a difficult balance. Partly because many in Labour are uncomfortable with both these policies and the accompanying rhetoric.Both the Conservatives and Reform can sense those tensions and both are trying to capitalise on them.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage even put out a statement to say something he knows Labour MPs won't like - \"The home secretary sounds like a Reform supporter\".Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both doubt these plans will even get through the Commons.Will the proposals work?The government is billing these changes as the most significant reforms to the asylum system since World War Two.Oxford University's Migration Observatory says Mahmood's overhaul will make the UK's immigration system amongst the strictest countries in Europe. But that doesn't mean the number of small boat arrivals will come down.\"This won't be the silver bullet and I think the government recognises that\", argues Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the organisation.\"It is taking a broader approach, focusing on enforcement and return deals. Will people know about restrictions enough to deter them? We will have to wait and see.\"Reducing \"pull\" factors and making the UK less attractive to migrants is a massive long-term battle.In this fight the government is up against sophisticated people-smuggling gangs who have shown they can adapt fast.The home secretary will be hoping her \"throw the kitchen sink at it\" approach gradually reduces arrivals and increases deportations.Mahmood believes community cohesion across the country depends on it.But so does her future and that of her government.",

    "body": "3 hours agoPeter Mwai & Richard Irvine-BrownBBC Verify    Getty ImagesWarning: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence and gunshot injuries.A crowd runs in panic along a dusty street. Shots ring out. A woman wearing a purple jacket carrying a stick falls to the ground.Another woman can be heard pleading, \"Mama, mama, stand,\" as she tries to lift her. Blood is spreading around her stomach as another stain appears on her back.This verified footage, filmed in Tanzania's city of Arusha, is just one of many graphic scenes to have emerged showing the violent actions of police as they attempted to crush widespread protests last month during the country's presidential and parliamentary elections.The protests started in the city of Dar es Salaam on 29 October and spread across the country over the following days. The demonstrations had largely been organised by young people left angry at what they see as a political system dominated by one party since Tanzania gained independence in the 1960s.Several opposition leaders were arrested and others banned from standing during the elections while a number of opposition activists were detained. Incumbent President Samia Suluhu Hassan ultimately secured victory after the electoral commission declared she received 98% of the vote.Since then the UN human rights office (OHCHR) said it had reports indicating that hundreds of people were killed during the protests, with many more injured or detained. A diplomatic source in Tanzania told the BBC there was credible evidence that at least 500 people had died.President Samia has called for an official investigation into the unrest and asked prosecutors to \"show leniency\" towards those arrested.Footage of the protests was suppressed for almost a week when the government imposed a near-total internet blackout and threatened to jail anyone caught sharing any videos from the protests, saying it could cause unrest. Only once the block was lifted on 4 November did dozens of videos begin to emerge online showing violent scenes: uniformed officers appearing to fire at crowds, bodies lying on the streets, with others piled up outside a hospital.To understand what happened, BBC Verify has analysed, geolocated and confirmed footage, building a clearer picture of how police responded to the demonstrations.Violence in Tanzania's largest cityIn the footage our team has verified the protests appear to have been dominated by groups of young men, drawing strong parallels with a global Gen-Z youth movement frustrated at economic decline and entrenched leadership in countries across Africa.The first demonstrations we identified took place early on election day in Dar es Salaam, the country's largest city and economic hub. They spread to other urban areas across the country, including the cities of Mwanza and Arusha.The internet blackout makes it difficult to establish a clear sequence of events, but what is clear from videos and images posted online is that protesters were confronted by heavily armed police units blocking their progress and firing tear gas to disperse crowds. In many of the videos, gunfire can clearly be heard as people scatter in the ensuing chaos.ReutersPolice used tear gas to disperse crowdsA key flashpoint was along the Morogoro Road, a main highway through Dar es Salaam. In two separate highly graphic videos, two bodies can be seen lying on the side road next to St Andrew's Anglican Church. One lies unresponsive, with heavy wounds visible on their head, surrounded by a pool of blood.We identified more bodies lying nearby around the same stretch of road: one next to a bus stop and two more on the ground surrounded by blood. One body is later seen wrapped in a white shroud.Further casualties are also visible along this stretch of highway and in the neighbouring side streets.Footage from another location close to the Open University of Tanzania shows a motionless body on the ground with an open head wound. In a later video taken from the same scene we see the body covered in a cloth and carried towards a group of policemen standing by the university building.\"Killers, killers,\" the group chants at the officers, one of whom is armed with a rifle, another carries a pistol. The body is then placed in the back of a truck.BBC Verify has confirmed at least a dozen other videos from Dar es Salaam showing people with a range of injuries, some of whom are being carried away.ReutersWe have also documented casualties from protests more than 700 miles (1125km) away in Tanzania's second-largest city, Mwanza, that took place on election day.Within the grounds of the city's Sekou Toure Hospital, several videos show a pile of 10 bodies, all of whom appear to be young men. Some of them have visible open wounds. Other footage from within the hospital shows bodies laid out in what appears to be a hospital morgue.Footage shows police firing on crowdsWe have verified multiple videos of police shooting towards groups of protesters.In three videos posted online, police vehicles are seen chasing dozens of people as the attempt to flee along Nelson Mandela Road in Dar es Salaam. Several rounds of gunfire can be heard as the police advance.DouyinArmed police chase fleeing protesters in Dar es Salaam as shots ring outIn Arusha, footage shows a police vehicle passing a crowd of chanting youths. Gunshots ring out and people are seen scattering and running for safety. Another video taken shows an injured man with those around him saying he's been shot.In the northern Kijitonyama area of Dar es Salaam, two men in uniform were filmed taking aim and firing along a main road in the direction of protests. We have confirmed the location next to a local school. The green uniforms and flat-topped peak caps worn by the two men closely match those worn by the Tanzanian police.XMen in police uniform take aim towards protestersLess than 100 metres away a man is shown lying on the street with a bloody head wound. In the distance, men wearing similar green uniforms can be seen. Someone shouts: \"He has been shot in the head. They have killed [him].\" As the video continues, more gunshots can be heard.There are also multiple videos seen by BBC Verify of men in the same green uniforms firing weapons - sometimes into the air, sometimes along open streets.Investigators from audio forensics experts, Earshot, said what can be heard in those videos confirms live rounds were used on protesters.After analysing the audio from the scene, they said: \"Rubber bullets typically do not travel at supersonic speeds.\"The presence of these shockwaves therefore indicates the use of live rounds.\"Not all the people we've seen carrying guns are wearing uniforms. In footage filmed in Sam Nujoma Road, Dar es Salaam, three men in civilian clothing are seen firing guns by a saloon car. It's unclear who they are. TikTokThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, has called for an investigation into the killings and other violations committed during Tanzania's elections, and for the unconditional release of all those arrested before the vote took place and others who have since been detained.The Tanzanian government and police have been contacted for comment.",

    "body": "7 hours agoHelen BushbyCulture reporter'She's still the funniest person in the world,' Pauline's son told BBC Breakfast\"She's still funny, she's talking, she's happy.\"Birds of a Feather actress Pauline Quirke was diagnosed with dementia in 2021. Her family, who are unsure what stage she is at, have spoken of their \"disbelief\" at the time. Despite being \"very private\", they told BBC Breakfast they wanted to raise awareness and funds for the condition. \"My mum has always been a charitable person. It's what she would want me to do,\" said her son, Charlie Quirke.Best-known for playing Sharon Theodopolopodous in long-running sitcom Birds of a Feather, 66-year-old Quirke was also nominated for a Bafta in 1997 for playing a convicted murderer in BBC drama The Sculptress.In 2022, she was made an MBE for services to the entertainment industry, young people, and charities.But earlier this year her husband, Steve Sheen, who she married in 1996, had to announce her retirement.This ended both her 50-year acting career, along with her role as head of Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts, which has about 250 academies, and more than 15,000 young students across the UK.Charlie Quirke and Steve Sheen said Quirke still tells them she loves themSteve said they first got an inkling something might be wrong with Quirke in November 2020, after she received a script.\"She started reading it and she phoned me on that day and said, the words are not going in. That's where it started,\" he said.Their reaction after the diagnosis was \"disbelief, really\". \"We looked at each other and went, 'Can't be, it's long Covid. Got the flu'.\"Charlie added he was \"quite surprised that this was possible in a woman in her 60s, and it can happen to people in their 50s, people in their 40s, so it's something you have to deal with and learn about\".Dementia is described as \"young onset\" when symptoms develop before the age of 65. It most often develops in people between the ages of 45 and 65 but can affect people of any age.Asked what stage Quirke is at in her dementia journey, Steve said: \"We don't know. She's still funny. She's talking. She's happy.\"\"Is it four years, eight years, 10 years, 12 years, 20, who knows?\" Charlie added: \"And that's the problem, no one tells you. \"My mum knows exactly who we are. Every time she sees all of us, she smiles, laughs, says 'I love you', says 'hello'.\"They spoke about why they were sharing their experience, and what they had learned so far. \"Unfortunately we are not in the state where we can do much about it,\" Steve said. \"Just take every day and try and take the best moment out of that day you can.\"It's a long journey. If we can just help a little bit by using Pauline as the catalyst to make more people aware, then we should, to use her to boost awareness and raise funds for dementia research.\" (L-R) Pauline Quirke as Sharon Theodopolopodous, Lesley Joseph as Dorien Green and Linda Robson as Tracey Stubbs in Birds of a FeatherSteve said the impact of the condition hit them slowly. \"It's so gradual that for the first year, two years, you're thinking, ah, she's alright. \"Now, we're three or four years in, it's a little bit different. This is why awareness is important. We didn't know how long it lasts or how long you have with it, or how bad it is or how quick it is.\"Charlie added that it \"progresses and changes every day, but so do we - we change and progress, and so we're forever learning\".The NHS website states dementia is a syndrome (a group of related symptoms) \"associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Quirke was nominated for a Bafta for playing murderer Olive Martin in BBC series The SculptressNext month, Charlie is doing a fundraising walk for Alzheimer's Research UK, going 140 kilometres to places that shaped his mother's life, including homes she has lived in, theatres and TV studios she has worked at. It will also include the Buckinghamshire headquarters of her children's drama academy. \"This is my mum's legacy,\" he said. \"This is going to be one of the stops on my trek, because she wanted to nurture the next generation of young actors.\"Steve paid tribute to his wife, saying: \"What you see is what you get. Loving. Brilliant. She's an iconic actress because her talent is immense.\"Charlie added: \"She is an incredible, strong, courageous woman that's been through a lot and she keeps going. \"She's a fighter and it's incredible to see, yeah, very proud of her.\"If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.",

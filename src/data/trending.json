Police searched them and found \"magnetised probes\" and a mirror attachment for a phone allegedly used to rig games.The pair have been charged with dishonestly obtaining a financial advantage and remain in custody.New South Wales Police said the couple had arrived in Sydney from Kazakhstan in October and applied for membership to the casino the same day.Over the following weeks, they made a number of visits to the casino - reportedly the Crown on Sydney's waterfront - and accumulated winnings totalling A$1,179,412.50.This raised the suspicions of casino staff, who allegedly caught them in the act on Thursday.Police said the spying devices were connected to the couple's mobile phones, allowing them to capture and view images of the table.NSW PoliceCasino staff noticed Dilnoza Israilova wearing the small, discrete camera on her Mickey Mouse T-shirtThey also wore hidden earpieces, through which they allegedly received instructions on when to wager on card games. A New South Wales Police spokesperson told the BBC that they were not currently looking for any other person in relation to the alleged fraud.In a subsequent search of their accommodation near the casino, officers found other \"gambling props\", high-end jewellery and €2,000 (£1,750; $2,320) in cash.The pair appeared in court on Friday and were denied bail, New South Wales police said.Mrs Israilova is due back in court in February, the Guardian Australia reports, while Mr Israilov is scheduled to appear on 11 December.",

    "body": "2 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterThe new left-wing party being founded by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana has voted not to have a single leader.At the party's founding conference in Liverpool, voters opted to be led by a panel of members - avoiding a potentially explosive leadership race between Sultana and Corbyn. The party also overwhelmingly backed plans to allow members to remain in other left-wing groups, only days after several members were expelled for belonging to the Socialist Workers Party.It is due to announce its name on Sunday evening, ending months of speculation.Corbyn will close the conference by announcing the result of a ballot that saw members choosing between Your Party, Our Party, Popular Alliance and For The Many. A party spokesperson said the new leadership model \"shows that we really are doing politics differently - from the bottom up, not the top down\".\"In Westminster we have a professional political class increasingly disconnected from ordinary people, serving corporations and billionaires instead of the communities they are supposed to represent,\" the spokesperson added.\"With a truly member-led party, we will offer something different: democratic, grassroots, accountable.\"Under the model, the party will be led by a Central Executive Committee (CEC) made up of 16 non-politicians chosen by members, rather than a single leader.The decision, approved by only 51% of members, headed off a leadership race that many had expected between Corbyn and Sultana.A contest between its two most well-known figures could have re-opened many of the splits that have overshadowed the founding of the fledgling party.Since launching the party in a surprise announcement in July, Sultana has repeatedly clashed with party officials.And less than a month out from its founding conference, MPs Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed left the group overseeing the project, citing a \"toxic culture\" - particularly towards Muslim men.Before leaving, both Hussain and Mohamed both put their name to a letter criticising Sultana for failing to transfer an estimated £800,000 of Your Party donations held by a company she controls.Sultana has transferred £600,000, promising any remaining money would be paid \"as soon as possible, as the legal details are ironed out\".Sultana did not attend the opening day of the party's conference in protest of the expulsion of some members who had retained their membership of other left-wing groups, such as the Socialist Workers Party.On Sunday, the new conference overwhelmingly approved allowing members to have dual membership in the future - Sultana's preferred option.The CEC will be able to exclude groups deemed to be at odds with Your Party's  values and will also oversee the party's strategy, staffing and resources.A \"democratic whip\" system will allow the CEC to instruct MPs to vote in line with party policy on crucial issues, though local branches will decide any sanctions for breaking the whip.Under the new constitution, the Independent Alliance of MPs - made up of Corbyn, Ayoub Khan and Shockat Adam - will oversee the selection of candidates for next year's local election, alongside a members' oversight committee made up of randomly selected members.It is not known if Sultana will have a role in the selection process.",

    "body": "At least four people have been killed in a mass shooting at a family gathering in California, authorities say.Ten others were injured in the shooting on Saturday evening at a restaurant in the state's northern city of Stockton.Local police say the victims include both adults and children. The conditions of the injured have not been confirmed.A suspect is still on the loose and police say they believe the shooting may have been \"targeted\".The city's deputy mayor earlier said the shooting had occurred \"at a children's birthday party\". Police have not confirmed the type of event at which the shooting occurred, beyond it being a family gathering.\"[A] birthday party should never be a place where families fear for their lives,\" Deputy Mayor Jason Lee wrote on social media.The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office said the shooting happened shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT on Sunday), and is appealing to anyone with \"information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of the incident\" to come forward.Spokeswoman Heather Brent described the incident as \"unfathomable\", adding: \"This is a very active and ongoing investigation, and information remains limited.\"Early indications suggest this may be a targeted incident, and investigators are exploring all possibilities.\"Stockton's Mayor Christina Fugazi called the shooting \"unacceptable\".\"Families should be together instead of at the hospital, standing next to their loved one, praying that they survive.\"California has some of the strictest firearm laws in the US, and has in recent years faced challenges to it.In 2021, a federal judge overturned the state's ban on assault weapons, such as the AR-15 rifle. The following year, the US Supreme Court expanded gun rights as it struck down a New York law restricting gun-carrying rights, jeopardising similar regulation in California.''Families should be together instead of at the hospital'', says Stockton's mayor",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames Cook,Jerusalem,Paulin KolaandPatrick JacksonEPANetanyahu said a pardon would lead to national reconciliation in IsraelIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, for a pardon over corruption cases he has been battling.  The president's office said Herzog would receive opinions from justice officials before considering the request \"which carries with it significant implications\".  Netanyahu has been standing trial for the past five years on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three separate cases. He denies wrongdoing. He said in a video message that he would have preferred to see the process to the end but national interest \"demanded otherwise\". The Israeli opposition says he should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.Early this month, US President Donald Trump urged Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Netanyahu. At the time, Herzog made it clear that anyone seeking a pardon had to submit a formal request.On Sunday, his office released the request and a letter by Netanyahu himself, in light of \"the importance of this extraordinary request and its implications\".It offered no indication of when the president might reach a decision.In 2020, Benjamin Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to stand trial:In the first case, prosecutors alleged that he had received gifts - mainly cigars and bottles of champagne - from powerful businessmen in exchange for favoursHe is accused in a second case of offering to help improve the circulation of an Israeli newspaper in exchange for positive coverageAnd in a third, prosecutors have alleged that he promoted regulatory decisions favourable to the controlling shareholder of an Israeli telecoms company in exchange for positive coverage by a news website.Netanyahu has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and branded the trial as a \"witch hunt\" by political opponents.In Sunday's defiant video message, he claimed that the cases against him were collapsing, but that the process was tearing Israel apart from within.\"I am certain, as are many others in the nation, that an immediate end to the trial would greatly help lower the flames and promote broad reconciliation - something our country desperately needs,\" the prime minister added.Netanyahu said he was being required to testify before court three times a week, describing that as \"an impossible demand.\"A pardon, he insisted, would help Israel fend off threats and seize opportunities by fostering \"national unity\".His political opponents have accused Netanyahu of attempting to conflate his interests with those of the state.Opposition leader Yair Lapid said there could be no pardon without an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse and Netanyahu's immediate retirement from political life.Yair Golan, a left-wing politician and former deputy commander of Israeli forces, said \"only the guilty\" sought pardon.According to Israel's Basic Law, the president \"has the power to pardon criminals and reduce or transmute [alter] their sentence\".However, Israel's High Court of Justice has previously ruled that the president can pardon an individual before they are convicted if it is in the public interest or if there are extreme personal circumstances.Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and his supporters have always supported a  pardon for their leader.But for many in Israel - especially on the left - it would be seen as another move away from the country's sense of itself as a robust democracy with a strong legal system.Public concerns over the government's plans for judicial reform brought hundreds of thousands out on to the streets in protest for many months before the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023 which triggered the most recent Gaza war.In a separate case, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant last year for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant over war crimes and crimes against humanity that have allegedly been committed during the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu has condemned the move as \"antisemitic\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoDanny AeberhardandTom BennettUkrainian naval drones hit two oil tankers from Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\" as they travelled through the Black Sea, Ukrainian officials have said.Footage verified by the BBC shows waterborne drones speeding through the waves into the vessels, before detonating into a ball of flame, sending black smoke into the air.The targeted tankers were named by Turkish authorities as the Kairos and Virat, both flagged to the Gambia. Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.The two ships are reportedly part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" - a term that refers to the hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.The shadow fleet is largely made up of aged tankers, many with obscure ownership or insurance.The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment on Friday. The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday. Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's overseas envoy, will hold talks in Moscow next week.",

Millions have been affected by heavy rains across South-East Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines.  An exceptionally rare tropical storm, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.People are missing in Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra, the National Disaster Management Agency said.\"There are two cities that require full attention due to being isolated, namely Central Tapanuli and Sibolga,\" agency head Suharyanto was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Ships were expected in Sibolga on Monday, he added.ReutersAid was delivered by navy helicopter to Palembayan on Sunday In Sungai Nyalo village, about 100km (62 miles) from West Sumatra's capital Padang, floodwaters had mostly receded on Sunday, leaving homes, vehicles and crops coated in thick grey mud, AFP reports.The authorities had not yet begun clearing roads, residents said, and no outside assistance had arrived.\"Most villagers chose to stay; they didn't want to leave their houses behind,\" Idris, 55, told the news agency.Police spokesperson Ferry Walintukan said there were reports of people breaking into shops on Sumatra, and police had been sent in to restore order, the Associated Press news agency reported.\"The looting happened before logistical aid arrived,\" Mr Walintukan added. \"[Residents] didn't know that aid would come and were worried they would starve.\"In another development, tech billionaire Elon Musk said he would provide free Starlink services to support communications during the emergency.Aerial footage shows severe flooding across southern Asia after torrential rainsThere has been widespread devastation across the region.At least 170 people died in floods in Thailand and there were several deaths reported in Malaysia. In the Philippines, tens of thousands of people have protested against government corruption, following a series of floods which killed more than 200 people this month. And in Sri Lanka, at least 193 people died from floods and mudslides as the country grappled with one of its worst weather disasters in years.",

    "body": "Tories urge financial regulator to investigate Reeves and Treasury over Budget build-up3 hours agoMichael RaceBusiness reporterGetty ImagesShadow chancellor Mel Stride has called for the UK's financial regulator to investigate \"possible market abuse\" by people working in the Treasury and Downing Street in the run-up to the Budget.The move comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves denied she misled the public over the state of the country's finances, after it emerged she and officials had been told they were in better shape than widely thought - but she still gave briefings that the Tories described as overly pessimistic.The Conservatives have called on her to resign and Stride sent a letter to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requesting a probe into potential market manipulation.\"Confidential market sensitive information appears to have been spun, leaked and misused - and markets, businesses and families have paid the price,\" he claimed.The FCA regulates financial services firms in the UK and part of its role is handling and investigating reports of market abuse, such as insider dealing or market manipulation.In his letter to the head of the regulator, Stride outlined briefings which were made in the run-up to the Budget over the picture of the country's finances, the economy, and speculation over tax rises.\"It seems increasingly clear that the Chancellor has been giving an inaccurate picture of the economic and fiscal context and this appears to be driven by political considerations,\" he wrote.He claimed \"leaks and spin\" from the Treasury had led to market speculation being \"rife and the gilt markets volatile\".The FCA has confirmed it received the letter and the BBC understands it will respond. The reaction of financial markets has been closely watched in the run-up and aftermath of the Budget giving the impact the tax and spending policies could have on UK borrowing costs.Many governments sell bonds - essentially IOUs - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest. But how credible the markets deem a chancellor's grip on the finances can affect how much it costs governments to borrow money. Following Reeves's Budget on Wednesday, the cost of government borrowing fell slightly, signalling a vote of confidence with the policy annoucements.Reeves announced a series of tax rises, and extended a further three-year freeze of the thresholds at which people pay tax and higher income tax rates, meaning millions of people will be pulled in and have to pay more from their pay packets. She also scrapped the two-child benefit cap.But the chancellor has faced since accusations she misled the public about the state of the public finances in the run-up.Reeves repeatedly talked about a downgrade to the UK's predicted economic productivity that would make it hard for her to meet her borrowing rules, fuelling speculation that the income tax rates themselves would be raised, which would break a manifesto pledge.On 4 November, she used a rare pre-Budget speech in Downing Street to warn the UK's productivity was weaker \"than previously thought\" and that \"has consequences for the public finances too, in lower tax receipts.\"Then, on 10 November, Reeves told the BBC: \"It would, of course be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.\"However, it has since emerged that the Office for Budget Responsbility (OBR) had told the Treasury on 31 October that it was on course to meet its main borrowing rule by £4.2bn, although the figure was less than the £9.9bn buffer Reeves had left herself last year.In a letter to the Commons Treasury select committee, OBR chairman Richard Hughes revealed that he also told the chancellor on 17 September that the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.Jeff Overs/BBCAs well as the Conservatives, the SNP has also written to the FCA urging it to look into claims of \"deliberately false and misleading\" briefings.Reports in the run-up to the Budget had suggested the chancellor could have faced a £20bn gap in meeting her tax and spending rules as a result of the OBR's productivity downgrade.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch called on Reeves to resign.\"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR had told her the complete opposite,\" she said.\"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare.\"Reeves hit back at critics on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, arguing the £4.2bn headroom she had wasn't an \"extra 4bn to play with\", but rather a downgrade from the £9.9bn buffer she had last year.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoHafsa KhalilReutersAt least 146 people are now known to have died in the devastating fire that tore through high-rise buildings in Hong Kong on Wednesday.Police announced the new death toll on Sunday, cautioning that they \"cannot rule out the possibility of further fatalities\". There still 150 people missing, and the blaze left 79 injured.Seven of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex in the northerly Tai Po district rapidly went up in flames. Accusations that the fire was spread by flammable construction materials have sparked widespread anger.Three days of national mourning started on Saturday, and thousands have gathered at the scene to mourn the victims.There have been queues stretching a long as 2km (1.2 miles), as people wait to lay flowers and handwritten notes.Indonesian worker Romlah Rosidah said she was \"very surprised\" at how many people had turned up to pray for the victims.\"This event was only spread on social media, but [it] turned out their hearts moved,\" she told news agency Reuters.A Filipino worker said they had joined the prayers to \"show the Hong Kong community that we are one in this situation\".Officials observed three minutes' silence to begin the mourning period, and the flags of China and Hong Kong are flying at half-staff.The fire is Hong Kong's deadliest in more than 70 years, and the death toll has been rising each day, as officials work to recover and identify bodies.The exact cause of the blaze has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovations that had been taking place on the towers, while three others were detained on manslaughter charges.Ching Sze Yip/BBCChing Sze Yip/BBCAmong the tributes added are handwritten messages for the victims of the fireHundreds of flower bouquets have been laid down as people queue to mourn and pay their respectsThe fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.Police official Tsang Shuk-yin said on Sunday that officers had so far completed searches of four of the tower blocks.Indonesia's consulate in Hong Kong said at least seven of its nationals had died from the fire, while the Philippines' consulate said one of its citizens had died.Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.The fire department said the blaze had reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F), and 12 firefighters were injured.The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on plastic netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.The buildings were also covered in bamboo scaffolding, which is commonly used for construction work in Hong Kong. The fire has renewed a debate about whether it should still be used.Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said that those arrested in the corruption investigation included directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. A police spokesperson previously said they had reason to believe \"those in charge at the company were grossly negligent\", which led to the fire and caused it to \"spread uncontrollably\".Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday. He was part of a group petitioning for an independent inquiry into the fire.Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.Hong Kong's second-deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse. The most deadly was at Happy Valley Racecourse in 1918, when more than 600 people died. ",

    "body": "It's time to lock in and let your winter arc begin16 hours agoGeorge SandemanBBCDani compares locking in to tunnel vision and says it helps her get things doneHave you ever locked in?No, not finding yourself locked in a lift or a bathroom.We're talking about locking IN - the phrase you might have seen on social media or heard people saying lately. To lock in is to focus; to endure short-term pain for long-term gain - whether that be building your body or your business. Do it today - not tomorrow. Everything else is a distraction.Motivational and ironic videos feature the phrase, which has been searched for online more this year than ever before, according to Google. So how exactly are people locking in and is it helping or hindering them?Locking in at the library\"My generation thrives off romanticising things,\" says Dani, a 20-year-old student at the University of Manchester.\"I feel like locking in is a way of romanticising getting into your deep work and making that decision of like, 'okay, it's time to get stuff done'.\" She compares it to tunnel vision.In her case it was a marathon revision session until 3am recently ahead of 10 hours in exam labs the following day. Her phone was kept on silent; electro-beats hummed in the background; digestive biscuits were devoured.@daniistypingtooDani thinks locking in is a way for her generation to romanticise the idea of working hardIn recent weeks as the nights have drawn in and days become colder, some influencers have been telling followers to stop missing the summer and see this as the perfect opportunity to lock in - to embrace their winter arc.\"I think it comes from TV shows and anime where you have characters with a villain arc,\" says Dani. She thinks feeling as though you are on a transformative journey of your own helps you stay on track with the tasks necessary to achieve your goals.Locking in on streamsKaragii agrees. She has turned her passion for gaming into a living and now works as a professional content creator in that industry - she locked in.For her, the phrase also serves as a personal rallying cry because of the sexism she faces \"almost every other day\" when playing games online. Her streams can last 11 hours so she has to ensure she eats regularly and spends time away from the keyboard - usually watching anime, playing with her cat or reading.@karagiiKaragii says she tells herself to lock in when she encounters sexism during online gamesThe 29-year-old says the comments she receives range from the patronising, \"you're good for a girl\", to the insulting - \"get back in the kitchen\".\"I tell myself 'I need to lock in' so [I remember] I can also play well, just like everyone else,\" she tells me from her home in Surrey.\"And also, remind myself that I need to be a role model to the young women that watch me.\"Locking in at the gymThat struggle for acceptance is also something Emma felt about joining a gym - but she found a way to overcome it.She initially did workouts at home and reduced the calories in her diet, as she felt she needed to fit a certain image of a gym goer. Now Emma, 28, feels this was damaging and unnecessary.After a year of training at home, she eventually joined a gym and enjoyed the physical and mental boost of lifting weights. So much so, she began working as a personal trainer in Lancashire this year and thinks one of the best ways to lock in is setting realistic and achievable goals. @emmarose_fitnessxxEmma says teaming up with a friend for workouts can help you avoid burning out at the gymHaving a methodical plan and a clear structure can help you get started but she cautions that you can burn out by locking in too much. \"That's completely normal and I think people should be reassured that is kind of part of the process and you're not always going to feel motivated 365 days a year,\" she tells me.Emma says there are ways to help avoid burning out. These include freshening up your workout routine, trying a new fitness class, or taking part in a challenge for a short length of time - like cycling a certain number of miles in a month.\"Accountability goes a long way as well when your motivation is low,\" she adds. Partnering up with a friend for your workout can help spur you into doing them more regularly.When did locking in begin?Adam Aleksic, a linguist who posts online as Etymology Nerd, says locking in's origins aren't certain but its use appears to have begun in the early 2000s - particularly in the African American community. There's an Urban Dictionary reference dating back to 2009.But it's only in the last year that it has taken off online, whether it be a motivational video for gains in the gym or ironically in a meme about a lazy cat.\"The more a meme gets readapted and reused, the more chances it has to stick in our actual vocabulary,\" the 24-year-old explains.Despite that, locking in didn't make it onto the word of the year lists for 2025. Collins' word of the year was \"vibe coding\", while \"parasocial\" was Cambridge Dictionary's.Allow TikTok content?This article contains content provided by TikTok.

Telling a friend to lock in on what might well be a boring day often raises a smile.\"It has that element of connecting us all,\" says Dani. \"I've never actually realised, given how much we use it, that it's slang.\"After her 10-hour day in labs a fortnight ago, Dani indulged her love of art - something she does to stop burning out.\"My friend and I were painting until 4am after our exam,\" she tells me.

    "body": "Reeves denies she misled public over UK's finances prior to Budget1 hour agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterLaura Kuenssberg presses Rachel Reeves on whether the public was misled before BudgetChancellor Rachel Reeves says she can be trusted with the country's finances and has been \"clear\" about reasons for her decisions, following claims she misled the public in the run-up to her Budget.In an interview for BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Reeves was challenged to explain why she had repeatedly warned about a downgrade to the UK's economic productivity forecasts.It has since emerged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) told her in mid-September the public finances were in better shape than widely thought.When pressed on the issue, she said she did not \"accept\" that it was misleading and said she had remained \"upfront\" about all her plans both in the past week and in the run-up to the general election. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also appearing on the programme, said she was not satisfied with the chancellor's denial and called on her to resign.The Conservatives have accused the Chancellor of giving an overly pessimistic impression of the public finances as a \"smokescreen\" to raise taxes. Badenoch claimed Reeves had \"lied to the public\".But Downing Street has denied the accusations and Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to back Reeves' budget decisions in a speech on Monday, saying the chancellor's decisions will help tackle cost of living pressures and lower inflation.Opening the interview, Kuenssberg asked Reeves whether she could be trusted and the chancellor responded: \"Yes.\"Kuenssberg then outlined what the chancellor said in a speech on 4 November, when Reeves indicated there was less cash than previously forecast due to a productivity downgrade, and she was likely going to need to raise taxes as a result.Reeves explained that, despite what critics were saying, \"I didn't have an extra £4bn to play with\" but instead that the OBR figures had been downgraded from £9.9bn headroom in spring to £4.2bn in the autumn.Headroom is the term for money left over after the government meets its expected budget costs under its own fiscal rules, providing a financial buffer for unexpected costs.\"I clearly could not deliver a budget with just £4.2bn of headroom,\" she said, as that would have been \"the lowest surplus any chancellor ever delivered\", and she would \"rightly\" have been facing criticism for the headroom being too small.She said: \"I was clear that I wanted to build up that resilience and that is why I took those decisions to get that headroom up to £21.7bn.\"Pushed on whether she had exaggerated the situation in order to pave the way for a £16bn increase in welfare, Reeves said she also had to factor in policy choices made in the previous six months on welfare and the Winter Fuel Allowance.She said: \"I did say when those policies changed just before the summer that we would have to find that money in the Budget, so I was very upfront about that.\"Yes, I did make the decision in the Budget to scrap the two-child [benefit] limit  - that was funded by increases on online gambling taxes and also by cracking down on tax avoidance and tax evasion, fully costed and fully funded, and lifting half a million children out of poverty.\"Asked if she had broken the spirit, if not the letter, of her manifesto commitment on taxation by freezing income tax thresholds, Reeves said: \"I recognise I did not say that in the manifesto but since then we've had both a significant downgrade in the productivity forecast but also huge global turbulence.\"She added: \"I have to respond to all those things because, if I were to lose control of the public  finances, we would be punished.\"Punished by financial markets that hold £2.6tn of public debt, and punished with higher interest rates, which wouldn't affect just the country but would also affect every single business that borrows, and every single family that has a mortgage.\"Kemi Badenoch on Reeves: 'I believe she should resign'Appearing on the same show, Badenoch said she was \"absolutely not\" satisfied with Reeves' explanation and she should instead have cut welfare spending. She urged the chancellor to quit.She said: \"The chancellor called an emergency press conference telling everyone about how terrible the state of the finances were and now we have seen that the OBR was telling her the complete opposite. \"She was raising taxes to pay for welfare - the only thing that was unfunded was the welfare payments that she has made, and she's doing it on the backs of a lot of people out there who are working very hard and getting poorer - and because of that I believe she should resign.\"Badenoch added her shadow chancellor Mel Stride has written a letter of complaint to the Financial Conduct Authority asking for an investigation.She accused the chancellor of trying to \"pitch-roll her budget - tell everyone how awful it would be and then they wouldn't be as upset when she finally announced it\", which could constitute \"market manipulation\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "15 hours agoBob HowardDublinNurPhoto via Getty ImagesJack likes a drink and a standard night out will probably involve several pints at his local.\"If you have three pints, that is easy, easy going,\" the 29-year-old says. \"Probably a heavy night, casually, would be like six-plus pints.\"Jack grew up in County Galway where, he says, young people often start drinking at 14 or 15, \"usually in a field with a horrendous can of cider\".\"And then, when you're 17, your dad brings you to a pub, buys you your pint of Guinness, and that's where it takes hold.\"Ireland has a complex relationship with drinking and many see alcohol and socialising as inextricably linked, part of the social fabric of everyday life.Pubs tend to be the focal point of communities where there's often live music, and many traditional songs celebrate or speak of the harms of having one too many. Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetusesIt was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"I know my limits. As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of DublinThree-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll beTwenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drinkHelen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028. It said the decision to defer was made following concerns raised about the impact of their implementation in the current global trading environment.More weekend picks",

    "body": "16 hours agoYolande Knell,Middle East correspondentandMalak Hassouneh,JerusalemBBCIn a bustling Gaza City market, a money repairer expertly inspects a worn, yellow 100 shekel ($30.50; £23.10) note. He straightens it out and enhances its faded colour with careful strokes of a pencil.Baraa Abu al-Aoun should have been studying at university - but instead he ekes out a living from a table he has set up at the roadside, taking a small sum to help keep cash in circulation.Fixing banknotes is a thriving new business in Gaza.Ever since the deadly Hamas-led attack on Israel in 2023 and the devastating war that ensued, Israel stopped transfers of banknotes, along with most other supplies.Most banks were destroyed in Israeli strikes, and many were looted. While some branches have reopened since a ceasefire took effect seven weeks ago, there are still no working ATMs.But people need cash to buy food and essentials. That has forced them to turn to informal money merchants who charge enormous commissions to turn digital transfers into cash. It has also sparked a huge increase in the use of e-wallets and money transfer apps.And it means that every existing banknote matters more than ever - no matter how tattered. That's where Baraa comes in. \"My tools are simple: a ruler, pencils, coloured pencils and glue,\" he says.\"The ceasefire hasn't changed the financial situation. What I do now is to serve people and help them.\"Watch: Baraa Abu al-Aoun carefully restores a banknoteGaza's economic collapse has been so catastrophic during two years of intense war that a new UN report says its entire population of more than two million has been pushed into poverty.Four in five people are now unemployed according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), and even those who still have an income or savings struggle to access cash.\"It's pure suffering and nothing else,\" says Numan Rayhan, who is displaced in Gaza City from Jabalia in northern Gaza with few belongings. \"Shortage of income, shortage of money, no cash flow from the banks.\"Early in the war, Israeli strikes targeted banks, which Israeli officials alleged were linked to Hamas. Their vaults were looted by armed Palestinian gangs, some presumed to have been Hamas. The Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA) has previously said that cash worth about $180m (£136m) was stolen.Cogat, the Israeli defence body which controls Gaza's border crossings, confirmed that in line with a political order \"and due to Hamas's reliance on cash to maintain its military activity\", Israel has not been allowing cash to enter Gaza.Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe lack of cash circulating has \"caused problems for both sellers and buyers\", says Zakaria Ajour, a stall-holder at another market in Gaza City. People don't want to accept worn and delicate notes at face value any more, \"if there are even small scratches or pieces of tape on a note.\"Some customers come to me just because they want small change for transport, but I don't have change,\" Mr Ajour goes on. \"Ten-shekel coins are barely found, and even when they are, they have virtually no value because of inflation due to the cash crisis.\"Now, there are long lines outside the Bank of Palestine in Gaza City, one of nine branches of five banks that have reopened. Customers can only reactivate frozen accounts, open new ones, or sign on to banking apps.Asmaa al-Ladaa wants to set up an account so that she can receive money directly from her relatives living outside Gaza.\"The whole process is just chaos and crowds,\" she says. \"We woke up at 06:00 and left our children behind in a tent. We left everything just to come to the bank.\"NurPhoto via Getty ImagesIn the southern city of Khan Younis, where the banks are too badly damaged to reopen, Abu Khalil has just returned from a trek to central Gaza. After spending much of the day queuing, he did not manage to enter the bank there, and despairs at the idea of having to go back again.The grandfather still receives a monthly salary of about 2,000 shekels ($612; £463) from the Palestinian Authority, but says that almost half of his income goes on charges he pays to vendors or money merchants. \"You have to pay the fees.  There's no alternative,\" he complains.During the war, adapting to the urgent need for cash, many small businessmen who previously offered money transfer and exchange services began charging customers high commission to turn electronic transfers into cash. On occasion it has reached 50%, although it has recently dropped.One money merchant, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells us that market forces determine commission rates. \"Our work is directly tied to market activity and the entry of goods and aid,\" he says. \"When there's an inflow of goods, and active buying and selling, the commission drops significantly, sometimes down to as low as 20%. But when the crossings close, the rate rises.\"Anadolu via Getty ImagesElectronic transfers through bank apps - for which shop and stall owners charge minor fees - have become a popular workaround for Gazans making purchases, even of small items.The PMA, which acts as a financial regulator, has launched a payment system allowing instant transactions between local bank accounts. For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.E-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme. Since early last year, Unicef says it has been able to make cash transfers to about a million people - half of them children. It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"Mr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.Hanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef. She used it to buy basics like rice, lentils and pasta.But she says: \"My children need vegetables, fruits, meat and eggs. My youngest son especially craves eggs, but I can't get them as prices are still so high and I have to cover the needs of 12 people.\"US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan promises an \"economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza\", convening \"a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities of the Middle East\".It envisages new investments and \"exciting development ideas\" that can \"create jobs, opportunity and hope for future Gaza\". But there are no details about how to begin to generate growth and stability, just as the UN's trade agency warns that the strip is going through the most severe economic crisis ever recorded.Anadolu via Getty ImagesBack in Gaza City, Baraa Abu al-Aoun holds the banknote he has been working on up to the light. expertly. He has more customers waiting, attracted by his sign promising repairs \"with high professionalism and without adhesive tape\".As Baraa toils on, he longs for a return to a normal life with prospects of more profitable employment.\"I just want this war to end fully,\" he says.  \"My hope is to feel relief at last, so that I can study and work with a degree.\"In Gaza, we're just surviving.  We're not human beings anymore.\"More weekend picks",

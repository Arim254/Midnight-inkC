    "body": "7 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson was unlawfully stopped driving a Bentley at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, and counter-terrorism officers made a disproportionate use of their powers, his lawyer has told a court.The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is standing trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court for refusing to give the Pin for his mobile phone to officers during the stop. He has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that while the stop may not have been \"perfect\", that does not mean it was unlawful. Judgement in the trial has been delayed until 4 November following closing arguments.If found guilty, Mr Lennon could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.He was stopped by police on 28 July, 2024, using their counter-terrorism powers as he prepared to enter the Channel Tunnel while driving a silver Bentley Bentayga.Officers from Kent Police said they did so partly because he was driving someone else's car and had not pre-booked his ticket. They said they became more suspicious when Mr Lennon would not make eye contact with them and said he was driving all the way to Benidorm. When asked for the Pin to his phone he refused.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices.In his closing submissions to the judge on Tuesday, Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, said: \"The question for you. Is this a lawful stop? If it is not, you cannot convict Mr Lennon.\"Mr Williamson described the power that police officers have at ports and airport as \"extraordinary\" and said there needed to be \"assiduous oversight\" of this power, which he described as the only one there was to \"compel people under pain of criminal penalty to answer questions\". He described Mr Lennon as a \"public figure\" whose views are \"well known\" and asked what the justification was for the police's use of \"coercive powers\". \"What were they going to find out that wasn't in the public domain?\" Mr Williamson asked. He pointed out that the officers did not ask any further questions about the Bentley after Mr Lennon told them it belonged to \"a mate\" and said his client travelled to Benidorm regularly. In her closing speech, prosecutor Jo Morris said \"we accept that the stop may not have been a perfect one but that does not make it unlawful\". She said \"there was no real dispute over the facts\" and that Mr Lennon had been warned of the consequences and was offered legal advice but still refused to give officers his Pin. Before the hearing began on Monday, Mr Lennon - the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) - said on X that the social media platform's billionaire owner, Elon Musk - who has previously championed him - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Mr Musk has not publicly confirmed this.",

    "body": "48 minutes agoIone WellsSouth America Correspondent andNadine YousifThe US has struck another vessel off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people, President Donald Trump has said. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the vessel belonged to \"narcoterrorists\" and that it was \"trafficking narcotics.\" This is the fifth strike of its kind by the Trump administration on a boat accused of trafficking drugs on international waters since September. In total, 27 people have been reported killed, but the US has not provided evidence or details about identities of the vessels or those on board them.Some lawyers have accused the US of breaching international law, and neighbouring nations like Colombia and Venezuela have condemned the strikes.In his Truth Social post, Trump said \"intelligence confirmed the vessel was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known\" route for smuggling. He also posted an aerial surveillance video showing a small boat on water that is struck by a missile and explodes.Trump did not specify the nationality of those on board, or what drug smuggling organisation they are suspected of belonging to. He added that no US military personnel were injured. The strike comes after a recent leaked memo sent to Congress, and reported on by US media, that said the administration determined the US was in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels. The US has positioned its strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels as self-defence, despite many lawyers questioning their legality.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "2 hours agoAna Faguy andMark SavageMusic correspondentAward-winning R&B singer Michael Eugene Archer, known to fans as D’Angelo, has died aged 51 after a battle with cancer, his family has said. In a statement, they said the star was leaving behind a \"legacy of extraordinarily moving music\" and asked fans to celebrate “the gift of song that he has left for the world”.The influential singer was known for pioneering neo-soul, a genre blending R&B with other types of music, including hip-hop and jazz. His three albums won him four Grammy Awards. The music video for his hit song Untitled (How Does It Feel) became notorious for its smouldering, single-shot performance, where D'Angelo appeared to be performing naked.\"The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life,\" his family said in a statement obtained by CBS News, the BBC’s US news partner. D’Angelo began his career as a songwriter, and worked alongside big names in music like Lauryn Hill and The Roots. He rose to fame in the 1990s with his debut album Brown Sugar. His song, Lady, from that album reached the No. 10 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 1996. That song earned him multiple Grammy nominations and secured his spot in the music scene.The son of a Pentecostal minister, D'Angelo was born in Richmond, Virginia, and taught himself to play piano at the age of three.Throughout his adolescence, he performed locally in groups including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (I.D.U.).When he was 18, he won the amateur talent competition at Harlem's Apollo Theater for three consecutive weeks; and was quickly signed to a publishing deal with EMI.He established himself as a commercial force with his 1995 debut album, also called Brown Sugar, and won two Grammys for the 2000 follow-up, Voodoo.However, he subsequently struggled with alcoholism and nearly died behind the wheel in a car crash in 2005. He returned to music in 2014 with Black Messiah - an album in the works for years - which he finished after watching the national unrest prompted by protests over the failure to convict police officers in the deaths of the unarmed black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.It went on to win the Grammy for best R&B album in February 2016.Among those paying tribute were hip-hop legend DJ Premier, who produced D'Angelo's song Devil's Pie.\"Such a sad loss,\" he wrote on social media. \"We have so many great times. Gonna miss you so much. Sleep Peacefully D' Love You KING.\"2020's Voodoo album topped the US charts and in their most recent list of the greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at 28 – one place above The Beatles' White Album.He had been working in the studio on what would have been his fourth album with Raphael Saadiq. Tributes have started to come in with hip hop star Tyler the Creator posting a black and white photo and Flavor Flav from Public Enemy calling him an icon.",

    "body": "5 hours agoBrian WheelerPolitical reporterHouse of CommonsThe UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood helped to bring about the ceasefire deal in Gaza, Sir Keir Starmer has told MPs.Speaking after a summit in Egypt, the PM stressed that the agreement signed there belonged to US President Donald Trump, telling MPs: \"This is his deal.\"But he said the UK had been in a position to work \"behind the scenes\" for a ceasefire \"precisely because of the approach this government takes,\" including its recognition of a Palestinian state.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said recognising Palestine without setting a condition for the release of hostages was \"rewarding terrorism\" and accused the PM of \"diminishing\" UK influence in the Middle East. Sir Keir told MPs that Monday's deal provided \"a moment of profound relief\" as he paid tribute to both the hostages and the civilians killed in Gaza.But he also stressed that \"making that peace last will be no less difficult a task\" and that implementing the peace plan \"is no small challenge\".Negotiations will now follow on phase two of the deal, which involves Hamas laying down its weapons - a possibility the group is reported to have dismissed - and the rebuilding of Gaza under a \"peace board\" chaired by Trump and potentially including former prime minister Sir Tony Blair.Sir Keir said the UK stood ready to deploy its diplomacy and expertise to support the reconstruction of Gaza - the devastation of which he says \"defies description\".The UK will provide an additional £20m in humanitarian aid to provide \"water, sanitation and hygiene products\" to people in the territory, he added.There are no plans to send British troops to be part of the multinational force that will monitor the truce, but the prime minister said the UK would help with the ceasefire monitoring process.And he said the UK could draw on its experience in Northern Ireland to \"play a full role\" in the decommissioning of Hamas's weapons and capability.The prime minster told MPs the deal represented the \"first real chance we've had\" of a two-state solution since the 1993 Oslo Accords, which were meant to provide interim self-government for Palestine as a stepping stone to an independent state.\"So we are fully committed to this [deal] because a safe and secure Israel, alongside a viable Palestinian state, is the only way to secure lasting peace for the Middle East,\" he told MPs. The PM also claimed that the UK's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood had aided the cause of peace.He told MPs: \"This move, taken alongside our allies France, Canada, Australia and others, helped lead to the historic New York declaration, where for the first time the entire Arab League condemned the atrocities of October 7, urged Hamas to disarm and, crucially, demanded that they end their rule in Gaza.\"Kemi Badenoch accused the prime minister of \"taking the wrong decisions time and time again, diminishing our influence in\" the Middle East.\"It's quite clear that UK relations with Israel have been strained by the actions of this government,\" she told MPs, to cries of \"shame\" from the Labour benches. The Conservative leader added: \"In a move praised by Hamas, Labour decided to recognise a state of Palestine with no condition to release the hostages still held in the tunnels of Gaza, rewarding terrorism.\"At the time, the US voiced strong opposition to the UK and other countries recognising Palestinian statehood, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying Hamas would \"feel more emboldened\" by the move.Under Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan, Gaza would initially be governed by a temporary transitional committee of Palestinian technocrats - supervised by a \"Board of Peace\".Governance of the Strip would eventually be handed over to the Palestinian Authority - which administers the West Bank - once it has undergone reforms.According to the plan, Hamas - which seized control of Gaza in 2007 by ousting its rivals, a year after winning legislative elections - would play no future role in its governance, directly or indirectly. The ceasefire deal says Hamas should release all the 48 Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza after two years of war.All but one were among the 251 people abducted during the Palestinian group's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 67,800 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. ",

    "body": "Some migrants coming to the UK will need to speak English to an A-level standard under tougher new rules set to be introduced by the government.The changes, which will come into force from 8 January 2026, will affect some graduates and those applying for skilled worker or scale-up visas, which are for people employed by fast-growing businesses.The new rules  form part of wider plans to cut levels of immigration to the UK outlined in a white paper in May.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: \"If you come to this country, you must learn our language and play your part.\"\"This country has always welcomed those who come to this country and contribute,\" Mahmood said. \"But it is unacceptable for migrants to come here without learning our language, unable to contribute to our national life.\"Applicants will be tested in person on their speaking, listening, reading and writing at Home Office-approved providers, with their results checked as part of the visa process.Those applying for skilled worker, scale-up and high potential individual (HPI) visas will be required to reach B2 level - a step up from the current B1 standard which is equivalent to GCSE.To come to the UK on the skilled worker visa, migrants have to work for a government-approved employer and earn at least £41,700 a year, or the \"going rate\" for their type of work, whichever is highest.The scale-up visa is open to migrants coming to work for a fast-growing UK business. Migrants can apply for a high potential individual visa if they have been awarded a qualification from a top global university within the last five years.According to the British Council, which offers English language courses, learners who achieve B2 level can \"understand the main ideas of complex texts on concrete or abstract topics.\"They can express themselves \"fluently and spontaneously\" and communicate comfortably with other English speakers. They can also produce \"clear, detailed text on many subjects and explain a complex viewpoint\".Further English language requirements for other visa routes and family dependants are expected to be introduced in due course, Home Office Minister Mike Tapp told Parliament on Tuesday.The prime minister previously said the changes outlined in the white paper would make the UK's immigration system \"controlled, selective and fair\".Home Office estimates suggest the measures could reduce the number of people coming to the UK by up to 100,000 per year.Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - fell to 431,000 in 2024, down almost 50% on the total in 2023, when it reached a record high of 906,000. Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the government faced a \"trade-off\" between \"ensuring migrants speak good English and enabling employers to recruit workers who are expected to bring economic benefits.\"Many graduate jobs already require language skills above A-level standard, she said.The new language requirements will have \"more impact in middle-skilled jobs involving technical and manual skills, where employers sometimes do not require high language proficiency\".Immigration lawyer Afsana Akhtar told BBC News she thought it was \"unfair\" that migrants had to reach such a high standard of English \"because even many people in the UK probably wouldn't be able to pass English A-level\". \"This would rule out even skilled workers who want to come and contribute to our British economy,\" she said. \"The GCSE standard is sufficient - and then when they come live here, [and] integrate into England and the English way of life, their English will improve inevitably.\"Other measures in the white paper include cutting the time period international students can stay in the UK to find a graduate job after their course ends from two years to 18 months, which will take effect from January 2027.Students will also have to meet higher financial requirements, raised to £1,171 per month outside London (from £1,136) for up to nine months.The Global Talent visa, for high achievers in technology, arts and academia fields has also been expanded to include winners of more prestigious prizes. Further plans in the White Paper include, the immigration skills charge for UK employers to pay when sponsoring foreign workers on specific visas has also been  increased to £480 per person per year for small organisations or charities, and to £1,320 for medium and large organisations.This is raised from £364 and £1,000 respectively.As part of the government's efforts to attract highly skilled people to the country, the HPI route will be expanded. The number of migrants on the visa is expected to double from 2,000 to 4,000, but there will be a cap of 8,000 applications each year.",

    "body": "4 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporter Former House of Lords Speaker Baroness D'Souza faces an eight-week suspension after complaining to the Metropolitan Police Commissioner about \"unfair\" speeding fines.A Lords inquiry found the 81-year-old peer broke rules on \"personal honour\" by writing to Sir Mark Rowley on Lords headed notepaper to query multiple breaches of the 20mph limit adding up to £400 in fines.Baroness D'Souza said she only wanted to \"open a conversation\" on London speed limits, but later called the letter to Sir Mark \"unwise\" and said she regretted sending it.The Lords Standards Commissioner ruled the letter was \"an attempt to influence\" the police investigation.In his report, Commissioner for Standards Martin Jelley said Baroness D'Souza's actions \"may harm the House by eroding public trust in parliamentarians and in institutions which exist to serve the public interest\". In the letter, Baroness D'Souza complained the offences would result in 12 points on her driving licence, which meant she would lose it and might have to \"give up attending Parliament\".\"I live deep in the countryside with no local bus services and unsuitable train schedules,\" she added.The peer had asked Sir Mark if losing her licence was \"a fair response for exceeding the speed limit while we are all still learning what a 20-mile speed actually feels like?\"\"Who can say if my speedometer or your radar is entirely accurate in recording 21 miles instead of 20,\" she added in her letter, which was sent on House of Lords headed paper.Baroness D'Souza,  a crossbench peer who does not belong to a party, was eventually disqualified from driving temporarily on 16 July. She has only spoken in the House of Lords once since then and, voted twice.In the letter, she acknowledged that Sir Mark, the UK's most senior police officer who also leads on Britain's counter-terrorism efforts, had \"much other business to deal with\".\"I apologise for bothering your office with such a trivial matter,\" she added.The Met Police passed the letter to the House of Lords' commissioner for standards who recommended an eight-week suspension, citing the aggravating factor that the intervention was for personal benefit.Baroness D'Souza,  who was the Lords' speaker between 2011 and 2016, denied she had been attempting to influence the police investigation, but instead find \"any mitigating factors\" that might keep any driving ban to a minimum.She told investigators she used Lords stationery because she had previously met Sir Mark \"in the context\" of her parliamentary role.Baroness D'Souza accepted that her letter to the Met Police chief was \"inappropriate\" and said she \"deeply regretted\" the decision to send it.She appealed against the proposed eight-week Lords ban, claiming it was \"unduly severe\" compared with shorter suspensions for bullying or misuse of facilities. Her appeal was rejected by the committee.The report will now go before the House for approval. If agreed, the suspension will take effect immediately.Baroness D'Souza was previously criticised for billing taxpayers thousands of pounds in expenses for chauffeur-driven cars.This includes a keeping chauffeur-driven Mercedes waiting outside the Royal Opera House - just a mile from parliament - for four hours, before returning to the Lords at a cost of £230.40.She also used a Mercedes to get from Westminster to Canterbury for the enthronement of Archbishop Justin Welby in March 2013 cost £627, freedom of information results found.",

    "body": "Asylum seeker laughed after killing woman, jury told30 minutes agoJames Bovillat Wolverhampton Crown Court andPhil MackieMidlands CorrespondentFamily / British Transport PoliceRhiannon Whyte's blood was found on Deng Majek's clothes, the court heardAn asylum seeker from Sudan danced and laughed after murdering a Walsall hotel worker in a \"vicious and frenzied attack\" on a train station platform, a trial has heard.Prosecutors allege Deng Majek, who claims to be 19, stabbed 27-year-old Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver at Bescot Stadium railway station on 20 October 2024. She died in hospital three days later.Opening the case for the prosecution at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Michelle Heeley KC told the jury that the defendant was \"clearly excited about what he had done\".Mr Majek denies murder.CCTV footage shown to the jury on Tuesday showed Mr Majek staring at Ms Whyte in the hotel, following her to the station, running from the scene and throwing her phone into the river, the court heard. CCTV footage was shown to the jury which prosecutors say shows Mr Majek following Rhiannon WhyteMs Heeley told the court Ms Whyte's blood was found on the defendant's clothes, while her DNA was discovered under his fingernails.She said Mr Majek was seen on CCTV at the Park Inn Hotel in Walsall, laughing shortly after killing her. The defendant had been living at the hotel, which houses asylum seekers, while Ms Whyte had worked there for about three months.The court heard her job included cleaning and serving food and co-workers could not recall any issue which might have led to the attack.\"There had been an issue about some broken biscuits with some of the residents but nothing serious,\" Ms Heeley said.CPSThe jury was shown CCTV footage on TuesdayIn a statement released following her death, Rhiannon Whyte's family described her as \"selfless... brave, quirky, funny\" and always there for other people. The prosecution said CCTV showed the defendant staring at Ms Whyte, before he followed her from the hotel to the railway station when she finished her shift at 23:00 BST. \"He had been hanging around waiting for her to leave and waited until she was on her own before he followed her,\" Ms Heeley said.The court was told Ms Whyte called a friend at 23:04 and he was seen on CCTV cameras closing the gap on her as she approached the deserted platform.Ms Heeley said: \"It was then that the prosecution say that this defendant attacked her.\"Her friend heard a scream and then another scream, before the phone went dead at 23:19.The prosecution said Mr Majek could then be seen running back up the stairs with an object in his hand, which they said was Ms Whyte's mobile phone.Ms Heeley said he then went to a local shop to buy himself a drink before returning to the hotel.Slumped on platformShe added: \"In between the station and the hotel he had thrown Rhiannon's phone into a river. \"Once at the hotel he was seen dancing and laughing, clearly excited about what he had done.\"The train she had been due to catch pulled in at 23:24 and the driver saw a figure slumped on the platform, the court was told.Ms Heeley said the guard tried to help her, along with another employee from the hotel, but nothing could be done to save her and she died on 23 October, having never regained consciousness.The court was told 11 of the 23 stab wounds penetrated her skull, one of which damaged the brain stem, causing her death. She also had injuries to her chest and arm, indicating she had tried to defend herself, the court heard. The puncture wounds had the appearance of a cross-headed screwdriver, which has never been found. Ms Heeley said: \"He left her bleeding to death and then casually went back to his hotel. We say you can be sure he is guilty of murder.\"The trial is expected to last about three weeks.  Police were at the station following the incident Related internet links",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu announced the planned suspension two days before his new government faced votes of confidenceFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week.The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency.\"This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,\" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties.Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive.Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as \"censure\" votes on Lecornu's government, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections.The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes.\"If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,\" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV.\"He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week.\"The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term.There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a \"wound on democracy\" .On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be \"compensated by other savings,\" Lecornu said.Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil.Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.\"We're living through an era of crisis,\" Lecornu told MPs. \"Some people want the situation to turn into a regime crisis, but that won't happen.\"Promising a \"serious and reliable budget\", the prime minister also vowed to bring an end to reliance on the 49:3 mechanism to push through legal changes without a vote. Since late 2022, every budget has had to be forced through without a vote.Repeatedly, he told the chamber that \"the government will propose, we will debate and you will vote\".Parliament will have \"the final word\", he said.To audible groans from MPs, Lecornu proposed a working group to look into pensions, and said it would have to come to a decision by the time of the next presidential election.France's budget deficit is far above the EU target of 3% of GDP, and Lecornu said that reversing the pension reform would have to be \"financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit\".Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally (RN) and the radical-left France Unbowed (LFI) of Jean-Luc Mélenchon have both tabled confidence votes in Lecornu's government on Thursday, but would need the support of centre-left parties to bring him down.The RN's Sébastien Chenu confirmed his party would vote against Lecornu later this week. \"We are not fooled by anything and cannot be bought,\" he said. \"Hello and goodbye, Mr Prime Minister.\"Mathilde Panot of France Unbowed also railed against Lecornu and Macron. \"Nobody believes in you any longer,\" she said.But a triumphant Boris Vallaud of the Socialists said the prime minister's decision on the pension reform was a \"victory\".\"The French were waiting for your statement and we were waiting for a sign that you'd heard them... The suspension of the pension reform: here it is at last.\"The support of the centrist bloc and the Socialists should give Lecornu enough votes to pass his budget in parliament – but the numbers remain extremely tight, and any breaking of the ranks could result in him being toppled.Le Pen and Mélenchon believe elections are the only way of ending the political deadlock that came out of snap elections called by Macron in the summer of 2024.That deadlock turned to turmoil last week when Lecornu resigned as prime minister 26 days after Macron had appointed him, and only hours after he had named his government.In a week of political twists and drama, Macron then reappointed him late on Friday.The move was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt by the president to exercise control over an increasingly rudderless National Assembly, which has been splintered into three distinct factions since the 2024 vote.That hung parliament has resulted in two short-lived prime ministers who were voted down within months when they attempted to put forward their yearly budgets.Eight days ago, Lecornu stood down before he could even face MPs.",

    "body": "18 minutes agoSammy AwamiBBC Africa, Antananarivo andDanai Nesta Kupemba'We have seized power,' says head of military unitAn elite military unit says it has seized power in Madagascar from President Andry Rajoelina following weeks of youth-led protests in the Indian Ocean island.Standing outside the presidential palace on Tuesday, CAPSAT chief Col Michael Randrianirina said the military would form a government and hold elections within two years. He also suspended key democratic institutions, like the electoral commission.Gen Z protestors will be part of the changes because \"the movement was created in the streets so we have to respect their demands\" he added.Troops and protesters have been celebrating the apparent ousting of President Rajoelina, with thousands waving flags in the capital, Antananarivo.CAPSAT stands for Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, and is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar.The unit supported Rajoelina when he came into power in 2009,  but joined the protesters on Saturday. Madagascar's constitutional court has named Col Randrianirina as the country's new leader, even though a statement from the president's office said he was still in charge and denounced what it described as an \"attempted coup d'etat\".Rajoelina's whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a \"safe place\" following an alleged attempt on his life by \"military personnel and politicians\".  CAPSAT has denied any involvement in any such move. There have been unconfirmed reports that the president was flown out of the country on a French military aircraft.As it happened: Madagascar military says it has seized powerMy one-month-old grandson was killed by police tear gas during Madagascar protestsAlso on Tuesday the US state spartment urged all sides \"to pursue a peaceful solution in line with the constitutional order\".Col Randrianirina told the BBC that Madagascar was \"a country where chaos reigns right now\".\"Chaos because there's no president - he's gone abroad.\" The unrest began just over two weeks ago, after a youth-led movement began protesting against chronic water and power cuts across the country.AFP via Getty ImagesYouth-led protests began over electricity cuts and water shortagesThe demonstrations soon escalated, to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelina's government over high unemployment, rampant corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.Protestors clashed with security forces resulting in the death of at least 22 people and more than 100 others injured, according to the UN, although the Malagasy government has dismissed those figures and described them as based on \"rumours and misinformation\".President Rajoelina, an entrepreneur and former DJ, was once seen as a fresh start for Madagascar. The baby-faced leader became president when he was just 34, earning the title of Africa's youngest leader, and going on to govern for four years, before returning to power after the 2018 election.AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Andry Rajoelina gave a speech on Monday via his Facebook page But he fell out of favour following allegations of cronyism and corruption, which he denied. Despite the fact that power appears to have shifted away from him, he has continued to try to influence events. Rajoelina attempted to dissolve the national assembly before the opposition could vote to strip him of his presidency for abandonment of post, but that did not work.Lawmakers voted to impeach Rajoelina by 130 votes to one blank ballot on Tuesday. Even members of his party, Irmar, voted overwhelmingly to impeach him.Rajoelina rejected the vote, calling it \"null and void\". The African Union (AU) has warned against soldiers \"meddling\" in Madagascar's political affairs and rejected \"any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government\".French President Emmanuel Macron called the situation \"greatly worrying\".The island has gone through a series of political upheavals in recent years.Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of its 30 million people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.

    "body": "9 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterGetty ImagesDan (left) said he felt \"completely violated\" by fan intrusion into their livesYouTube double act Dan and Phil have confirmed their relationship after 16 years of fan speculation, ending what they called the \"apocalyptic constant stress of the Dan and Phil dating conspiracy\".Dan Howell and Phil Lester have amassed millions of followers, hosted a BBC Radio 1 show, published best-selling books, and been on world tours.Many of the British pair's comedy and gaming videos show them in the house they share, and they separately came out as gay in 2019, but they hadn't directly spoken about their relationship.\"We fell into it hard and fast in 2009, and here we are almost 16 years later,\" Dan said in the new video, telling followers they \"can't live in fear any more\".They shared the best vlogger prize at the Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2016The couple spoke about the impact of intrusion and intense speculation from fans, which Dan said \"could have killed me\".He also explained it had taken time to discuss the relationship publicly because of the effects of his \"extremely homophobic childhood\", which meant he had been \"deep in the closet\" for years.\"In my mid 20s I felt we had to hide the relationship because I was still hiding who I was to my friends, family, myself,\" he said.\"This is why all of the digging from people online hit a nerve, because Phil was my safe space. You were my first boyfriend... You were a literal ray of light in my life back then.\"Dan & Phil take on Taylor Swift in an art challenge at the Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2013Dan continued: \"And what we had was the most important thing to me and I wanted to protect it, so when other people tried to grab it and drag it into the light, I felt completely violated.\"Having all of these people trying to out us, and being so hostile to me when I tried to hide it, was so triggering. Honestly, it could have killed me.\"Dan added that he felt like someone had put a curse on them, with them achieving huge success \"but half the time it's going to suck for years, wake up in the night with anxiety, you're going to have panic attacks\".He said there were times when he thought he might be \"happier without all of this\". \"Yeah, [in] 2017 I'm thinking, my solo comedy content is killing it on YouTube, this could just be my life. I could be like every other YouTube boy and just enjoy this without the apocalyptic, constant stress of this Dan and Phil dating conspiracy.\"'A cycle of never-ending closets'He said he had decided to make the relationship public after a recent therapy session.\"My therapist said, 'Dan, you love being in the closet'. And I was like, 'Excuse me?'\"He continued: \"I spent so long not being authentic and being trapped in a situation, that I am comfortable being miserable in an environment where I don't do the thing that would suddenly make me feel better. I am in a cycle of never-ending closets, and this secret conspiracy is just another thing that I'm trapped inside.\"Phil added that some followers may have already guessed, but making the announcement was \"a big scary deal for us, it's kind of like another mini coming out\".He acknowledged that the move may attract more homophobia.\"Look, sure, this is a scary time in the world,\" Dan replied. \"Let's be real, it feels like things are sliding backwards because the fighting for what was important was going a bit too well.\"But I think that's why it's more important than ever that we're like, 'You know what? Hey, here we are, gay. And what?'\"'Happy and relieved'Their reveal was met with praise and love from longtime fans.\"I just adore you both so much,\" wrote one.Another wrote: \"Listen. Not our business. Never been our business. Fully aware it's parasocial. But after all these years, I'm both very, very happy for you both and feeling a bizarre sense of relief.\"\"Thank you for making me feel accepted just as I am throughout the years. I am glad you both feel safe enough to be your authentic selves!\" posted someone.\"This is like gay independence day,\" said another.Followers also celebrated what a big part of their lives the pair have been over the years.\"I've finished my bachelor's, master's, med school, and a PhD by the time they hard-launched their relationship,\" wrote one.\"Big day for girls who were on Tumblr from 2012-2015,\" said someone else.\"There's at least 20 people I haven't spoken to in seven years that I need to call RIGHT NOW,\" wrote another.\"I've literally had to go outside and have a cigarette,\" someone else posted.",

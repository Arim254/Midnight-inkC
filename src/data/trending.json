The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "6 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAn 18-year-old has been named as the suspect in a shooting that killed eight people and injured dozens more in British Columbia, Canada.Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot injury. The motive for the attack is not yet known.Six people were killed and at least 25 others were injured at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Two others - the suspect's mother, 39, and step-brother, 11 - were found dead at a nearby home. Authorities said Van Rootselaar was born a biological male but identified as a woman. \"I can say that Jesse was born as a biological male who approximately six years ago began to transition to female,\" Dwayne McDonald, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) deputy commissioner, said. The shooting at the nearby home occurred first, then the suspect went to the school, McDonald said.The victims at the school were a 39-year-old female educator, three female students, all aged 12, and two male students, one aged 12 and the other 13. Authorities do not believe there are other suspects involved in the shootings.Police said they had attended the suspect's family home on multiple occasions over the past several years, with some calls related to mental health concerns.Van Rootselaar previously had a valid gun licence that had since lapsed, McDonald said.Police said Van Rootselaar had dropped out of Tumbler Ridge Secondary School four years ago. Around 13:30 local time (20:30 GMT) on Tuesday, police received a report of an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Officers arrived on the scene within two minutes of the call, heard active gunfire and entered the school, McDonald said. Within minutes they located the shooter, who was deceased from what police say was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Authorities found two firearms - a long gun and a modified handgun - on the scene. But McDonald said it remains unclear the exact roles the firearms played in the shooting. Police then began searching for victims throughout the school. Two victims were taken to hospital by air ambulance and remain in hospital. Tumbler Ridge has about 2,400 residents, and its secondary school has 160 students in Grades 7-12.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the students and teachers \"bore witness to unheard of cruelty\" during the shooting, noting that some victims remain in hospital \"fighting for their lives\".Tumbler Ridge Mayor Darryl Krakowka told CBC that the community is small and tight-knit, and that he expected the victims to all be people he knows.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" he said, after emerging from the town hall when the shelter-in-place order was lifted.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family.\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesBud Cort and Ruth Gordon, who starred in Harold and MaudeUS actor Bud Cort, best known for his role in the 1971 cult classic Harold and Maude, has died aged 77.Writer and producer Dorian Hannaway, a close friend, said he died after \"a long illness\". The BBC has reached out to Cort's representatives.A veteran actor of stage and screen, Cort appeared in more than 80 films and TV series, including Wes Anderson's quirky comedy The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.But it was his star turn as a young, death obsessed Harold who falls in love with Maude, a charming elderly woman played by Ruth Gordon, in Hal Ashby's beloved film that stayed with audiences throughout his 50-year career.While Harold and Maude was originally a commercial and critical flop, it later gained traction in the 1970s through a loyal cult following thanks to its unique dark humour and quirky romantic pairing.\"A young man obsessed with death falls in love with an old woman obsessed with life. She dies and teaches the kid how to live,\" Cameron Crowe described it for AFI in 2011. \"And it's done with music [by Cat Stevens] that scratches at your soul... that movie holds up - to this minute.\"CBS Photo ArchiveA young Bud Cort as Harold Chasen in Harold and MaudeDirector Edgar Wright paid tribute to the actor's work, calling him a \"welcome and magnetic presence in every film lucky enough to have him\".On his performance in Harold and Maude, Wright said: \"Not only is this beloved film a pitch perfect black comedy-cum-love story for the ages, but Bud Cort delivers one of the greatest looks to camera in film.\"The role earned him acting nominations for a Golden Globe and a Bafta.Born in New Rochelle, New York in 1948, Cort showed an early interest in performing and acting in many school productions.Getty ImagesHannaway remembered him as a \"passionate theatregoer\" who would sneak off to Manhattan to see Broadway shows and wait at the backstage door hoping to catch a glimpse of Barbara Streisand after watching Funny Girl.Moving to Los Angeles in the 1960s to pursue a career in film, he was cast in a small part in the 1970 film M*A*S*H, before landing the titular role in Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud.Cort worked steadily throughout his career with supporting roles in films such as Heat, Dogma and Invaders from Mars.He also appeared in several popular TV series including Arrested Development, Ugly Betty and Criminal Minds.",

    "body": "Just nowBBCAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor features on the front pages of many of Thursday's papers, with the Mail writing \"now detectives discuss Andrew 'leaks' to [Jeffrey] Epstein with prosecutors\". The paper headlines on \"Labour women's fury over second paedophile crisis\". Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was \"skewered\" in the Commons for awarding a peerage to his former communications chief, Matthew Doyle, \"despite knowing he had stayed friends with a Labour councillor charged with child sex-offences\". Sir Keir has said Lord Doyle \"did not give a full account\" over his links to a convicted sex offender.The i Paper headlines on the \"growing police inquiry\" into Andrew's Epstein links. It writes that detectives are \"assessing claims that paedophile Jeffrey Epstein sent a woman to Windsor for 'sexual purposes' involving the former prince\". Andrew has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.The Sun calls Andrew a \"credit cad\", reporting that the \"Queen, Philip and Charles loaned Andy £12m for Virginia pay-off\" but \"he hasn't paid back a penny\".There is \"outrage at Prem boss\" writes the Daily Mirror, calling billionaire Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe \"shameful\" for his comment that Britain had been \"colonised by immigrants\". The paper also says a picture released in the latest Epstein files of Andrew on all fours above a woman, both fully dressed, shows a \"sex-traffic victim\". The Daily Express also leads on the claims from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, highlighting his comments that \"new arrivals to Britain are 'costing too much money'\".The Daily Star reports a \"Man U Jim 'racism' storm\" after Sir Jim's comments. He has been \"slammed\", it adds, noting that a \"furious\" Sir Keir is \"demanding an apology\". Labour is \"up for\" closer ties with the EU writes the Daily Telegraph in its headline. A photo of Mick Jagger and his fiancee Melanie Harrick is used to mark reports she was \"attacked outside Annabel's\", the private members club in London. The Telegraph also says dogs have been accused of ruining relationships by staring at owners \"during intimate moments\". \"No heavy petting with Fido in the bedroom,\" it advises.For the Guardian, female Labour MPs' demand that the prime minister \"select female deputy to end 'boys club'\" make the lead. It notes that Sir Keir has said Lord Doyle \"did not give a full account of his actions\" before being nominated for his peerage. Metro leads with a \"jammy dodger\", reporting that a prolific fare evader admitted 112 offences but was spared jail. The man owed at least £3,600 for the journeys and £31,742 in financial orders for past fare dodging, it reports.The biggest wealth managers \"take beating in latest round of disruption from AI\" headlines the Financial Times.

It comes as Kyiv is \"gearing up\" for presidential elections and a referendum on any peace deal with Russia, the FT writes.The prime minister is coming under increasing pressure to appoint a woman as his de facto deputy and end Number 10's \"boys club\", according to the Guardian. One of the party's most senior figures, Harriet Harman, has called on Sir Keir Starmer to revive the role of first secretary of state - a post previously held by Peter Mandelson under Gordon Brown.Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said she's \"up for\" taking Britain closer to the EU, according to the Daily Telegraph. Speaking at an event in London, Reeves said closer relations represented the \"biggest prize\" for the economy. The report notes that is a significant shift from comments she made in Davos last month, when the Chancellor said Britain could not \"go back in time\" in its relationship with the EU.The Metro leads on a warning from the Shadow Transport Secretary Richard Holden, who says fare dodgers are harming the UK. The paper says his comments came after a man who used trains for two years without buying a ticket, totalling £3,600  in free journeys, was spared prison. \"Jammy dodger\" reads its headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "11 hours agoRobert GreenallandGabriela PomeroyTrent ErnstThe shootings have sent shock waves through the small townPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "6 hours agoMaia DaviesReutersEmergency services attended the scene after three further bodies were found on 9 FebruarySix people have been found dead in suspected murder-suicides in a mountain range in western Bulgaria, officials have said.Three bodies, including that of a 15 year old, were found in a van parked in a remote area of Stara Planina on Sunday. Investigators said they were connected to three others found dead near a burned-down hut six days prior.Officers said CCTV footage showed the two groups saying goodbye to each other at the hut, with the three who remained at the scene later filmed setting it on fire.Bulgaria's acting prosecutor general Borislav Sarafov said the case contained \"more shocking details\" than Twin Peaks - the drama about a murder investigation in a US logging town.Prosecutors have said the deaths were likely murder-suicides or suicides - sparking fevered speculation in the country and criticism of the investigation.The national police chief branded the case an \"unprecedented crime\" unlike any other seen before in the country.The first three men - aged 45, 49 and 51 - were found dead near a burned-down hut on 2 February, local media reported citing Bulgaria's interior ministry. All had gunshot wounds and there were \"no signs of a struggle\" or further trauma, Natalia Nikolova from the Appeal Prosecutor's Office in Sofia told reporters on Monday. Forensic experts determined that shots had been fired from close range. According to the Reuters news agency, two handguns and a rifle were found at the scene near the Petrohan mountain pass, about an hour's distance from the capital Sofia.Six days later, officers found two men and a 15-year-old boy dead in a parked camper van near Mount Okolchista.\"The individuals are connected to the Petrohan case,\" national police chief Zahari Vaskov told reporters.He said they had wounds from shots which appeared to have been fired inside the vehicle. Prosecutors later said autopsies indicated there had likely been two murders and one suicide.Most of the victims belonged to a nature protection NGO, officials said.

    "body": "2 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorPA Media, EPALeft to right: Lord Peter Mandelson, Sir Keir Starmer and Lord Matthew Doyle (composite image)We are currently witnessing the curious spectacle of two men, both of whom have served as the prime minister's director of communications within the last year, on opposite sides of a public row over the controversial appointment of one of them to the House of Lords.Tim Allan, who was in charge of Sir Keir Starmer's communications until he resigned on Monday, has issued a statement, first published by The Times, in which he says he spoke to Lord Matthew Doyle about his connections to a sex offender before the now peer was offered seat in the Upper House.It is a reminder of the staff turnover there has been in Downing Street in Sir Keir's first 18 months or so in office – and indeed just this week, as Allan refers to the also now departed former Chief of Staff, Morgan McSweeney.And it substantiates the argument Sir Keir himself made in the House of Commons.\"I was asked to speak to Matthew Doyle by Morgan McSweeney regarding Doyle's  relationship with Sean Morton. I accurately relayed what Doyle had told me to the PM. The PM is right to state that Doyle did not tell me about his campaigning in a council election for Morton. Doyle did however tell me that he had believed Morton's protestations of innocence prior to his conviction and had been supportive of him during that time.\"I have offered Lord Doyle a right of reply at each stage of this story over the last day or so and he has so far declined to comment. In an earlier statement he said he apologised for an \"error of judgement\" in choosing to campaign for a man who had been charged over images of child sexual abuse.And all this after the prime minister was told to his face by one of his own MPs, Emma Lewell, that the last few weeks had led to people \"screaming at me in the street that I am a member of the paedo protectors party\".The remarks, at a private meeting of Labour MPs and peers with the prime minister, hadn't been intended to be heard beyond the room in which they were made. But they are an insight into the fear that the noisy revelations of the last few weeks are cutting through to the wider electorate, are being noticed.This latest row has prompted fresh concerns within Labour about the prime minister's judgement, as there are striking parallels with the last one about Lord Mandelson.A prominent Labour figure is offered a job in the prime minister's gift, only for revelations to emerge that lead some to question the wisdom of the appointment. The prime minister then publicly criticises the person he gave the job to and criticises the vetting process for their appointment.Am I talking here about Lord Mandelson or Lord Doyle? As different as the two cases are in their specifics, I could be talking about either when it comes to how their jobs came about.There are now calls within the Labour Party for Lord Doyle to be stripped of his peerage, under the new law originally planned to remove Lord Mandelson's seat in the Lords.As for the prime minister, he must be mighty glad the half-term break is now imminent and Parliament will be in recess for a week.He could no doubt use a firebreak from the recent political heat.",

    "body": "1 hour agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesRussian regulators are pushing a state-developed app as an alternative to WhatsAppRussia has \"attempted to fully block\" WhatsApp in the country, the company said, as the Kremlin continues to tighten restrictions on messaging apps.Meta-owned WhatsApp said the move aims to push more than 100 million of its app users in Russia to a \"state-owned surveillance app\".This comes after Russian regulators further curbed access to Telegram, citing a lack of security. Telegram is estimated to have as many users as WhatsApp in Russia.The Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.\"Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,\" said WhatsApp in a statement.\"We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected.\"Russia's communications regulator, the Roskomnadzor, has made repeated warnings to WhatsApp to comply with local law.State-owned Tass Media reported earlier this year that WhatsApp is expected to be permanently blocked in the country in 2026.\"Such harsh measures\" are \"absolutely justified\" since Russia has designated Meta as an extremist organisation, Andrei Svintsov, a Russian official, was quoted as saying.Since that designation in 2022, Meta apps like Instagram and Facebook have been blocked in Russia and are only accessible through virtual private networks.The app has been likened to China's WeChat - a so-called \"super app\" that combines messaging and government services, but without encryption.Russia has argued that both WhatsApp and Telegram have refused to store Russian users' data in the country as required by law. Since 2025, the authorities have mandated that the Max app be pre-installed on all new devices sold in the country. Public sector employees, teachers and students have been required to use the platform.Telegram's chief executive, Russian-born businessman Pavel Durov, said the state is restricting access to its service in an attempt to force its people to use its own app for surveillance and political censorship.Iran has tried a similar strategy to ban Telegram and push its people to a state-run alternative, but citizens have found ways to work around this, he wrote online.\"Restricting citizens' freedom is never the right answer,\" said Durov.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi AsieduWashingtonBloomberg via Getty ImagesThe US House of Representatives has voted to rescind US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods.In a 219 to 211 vote, six Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to back a resolution that seeks to end the tariffs Trump imposed on Canada last year. The vote is largely symbolic as it will still need to be approved by the US Senate and then approved by Trump, who is very unlikely to sign it into law. Since his re-election, Donald Trump has imposed a series of tariffs on Canada, recently threatening a 100% import tax in response to Canada's proposed trade deal with China.As the vote was taking place on the House floor, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time.\"\"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege,\" he added.The vote came after US House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally in Congress, unsuccessfully tried to block discussion on the chamber's floor by lawmakers on Trump's tariffs.With Republicans holding a thin majority in the US House, the six Republican defections along with a near-united front from Democrats was enough to secure the votes.The measure had been introduced by Democrat Gregory Meeks who said that  Trump had \"weaponized tariffs\" against allies and destabilized the global economy.\"Not only have these tariffs done immense harm to our relationship with Canada, pushing them closer to China, they have driven up prices here at home,\" he said before the vote. Representative Don Bacon from Nebraska was one of the six Republicans who crossed the aisle to join Democrats in approving the measure. Before the vote, he said \"tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying.\"The bill now heads to the US Senate where Republicans also hold the majority. Even if it cleared that hurdle, it is unlikely to be signed into law.Meeks, the top Democrat on the US House Foreign Affairs committee, said the measure on Canada is the first of several bills he plans to introduce that aim to roll back Trump's signature trade action.\"Our fight doesn't stop here,\" he said in a video posted online before the vote. \"I have resolutions also to end trump's tariffs on Mexico, on Brazil, and on his Liberation Day global tariffs.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterGetty ImagesLegislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote at the next general election is beginning its journey through Parliament.The Representation of the People Bill, which also includes measures to tighten the rules around political donations and protect against foreign interference, will be introduced on Thursday.Meanwhile, the government said seven councils in England will test out using locations such as train stations or supermarkets for polling booths in May's local elections to make it easier for people to vote.The government said lowering the voting age would engage young people in democracy and ensure their voices are heard.However, opponents of the idea question whether 16-year-olds have enough life experience to vote.Shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly said: \"The Conservatives are clear that people become adults at 18 and that is when citizenship rights – such as voting – should be gained.\"The minimum voting age is already 16 for local council elections in Scotland and Wales, as well as elections to the Senedd and Scottish Parliament.But for other elections, including to the UK Parliament, local elections in England and all elections in Northern Ireland, it is 18.The proposals to lower the voting age to 16 across the UK would be the biggest change to the electorate since it was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969.To become law, the bill must be approved by both MPs and peers, a process which can take months.The government has said it is aiming for the changes to be in force by the next general election, which is due to take place by 2029 but could be called earlier than this.Critics have claimed the move to lower the voting age is opportunistic, as younger people are more likely to vote for left-wing parties.In the UK, 16 and 17-year-olds make up only around 3% of the population aged 16 and over so researchers say the impact on overall vote share is likely to be negligible, particularly as turnout tends to be lower for younger age groups.Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office spokeswoman Lisa Smart said votes at 16 were \"long overdue\" but the bill was \"nowhere near enough to fix a democracy that's in crisis\".\"We need to scrap our broken, unfair voting system, finally make the House of Lords democratic, and stamp out the influence of foreign adversaries in our elections altogether,\" she added.The bill also includes measures to strengthen the rules around foreign donations.Currently political parties can only accept donations from individuals registered on a UK electoral register or UK-registered companies which carry out business in the country.However, there have been concerns that foreign nationals could get around the rules by donating through a foreign company that is registered in the UK.Under the government's proposals, companies making political donations will have to show they have a genuine connection to the UK, including demonstrating they are headquartered here, majority owned or controlled by UK electors or citizens and have generated sufficient revenue in the UK to cover the donation.Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said: \"The Representation of the People Bill will usher in a new era for our democracy – one that protects against foreign interference and empowers young people.\"With growing threats from abroad, now is the time to make changes to make our elections secure and get young people engaged in them.\"Other measures in the government's elections strategy, which are expected to be part of the bill, include expanding forms of voter ID in Great Britain to include UK-issued bank cards and moving towards automatic voter registration",

    "body": "5 hours agoFaarea MasudBusiness reporterGetty ImagesPlans for a tax on people taking holidays in England should be scrapped, 200 hospitality and leisure bosses have urged.The government is considering allowing mayors and other local leaders in England to introduce a \"modest\" tourist tax, or visitor levy, to raise revenue.A version of the measure is already in place in some English cities, but it is something local businesses voluntarily add to bills rather than a local authority tax.However, major holiday providers including Butlin's, Hilton, Travelodge, and the owner of Alton Towers theme park have told the government its proposals would drain money from local businesses.\"Holidays are for relaxing, not taxing,\" the groups wrote in a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves.The businesses say people \"would face an extra £100 or more for a two-week holiday\" if a tax of £2 per person, per night was introduced. \"It could force families to shorten trips, skip travel altogether or head overseas, spending their money elsewhere,\" they say.The government's preferred approach is for the tax to be calculated as a proportion of the cost of the accommodation being provided, as opposed to a flat rate, and it says local mayors \"should consider the right level for their area.\"Its consultation on whether to give English local leaders the power to introduce the tax ends on 18 February.In Scotland and Wales, all local authorities already have the legal power to apply a visitor levy. Northern Ireland currently has no plans to introduce a levy.\"Mayors and other local leaders are best placed to identify and invest in the projects and infrastructure that drive growth and make a place attractive for visitors and residents,\" he said at the time.In some areas in England the tax already exists as a levy which groups of hospitality businesses in business improvement districts (BIDs) have agreed to add on to bills.In Manchester, for example, the £1 per room visitor tax has been in place since 2023, and raised £2.8m in its first year.The Manchester accommodation BID, a body representing 74 hotels and serviced apartments providers in the city, said cash raised from the charge had funded a campaign to boost stays during \"traditionally lower occupancy months\".Allen Simpson, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the UK already has high taxes, and the government proposals would make holidays even more expensive.\"We should be encouraging people to visit every part of our country – not taxing them for doing so. The government needs to scrap the holiday tax,\" he said.Starting in summer, Edinburgh will be charging a 5% levy on hotel, B&B and holidays bookings.Aberdeen and Glasgow have also agreed to introduce a visitor levy, while several councils - including Orkney and Shetland - have rejected the idea.Major tourist cities such as Paris, Rome and Brussels already have their own version of a tourist tax.A UK government spokesperson said: \"We're giving our mayors powers to harness this and put more money into local priorities, so they can keep driving growth and investment in the economy, supporting thriving communities.\"We expect any new charges to be modest and in line with other countries, and it is for Mayors to consider the right level for their area.\"But Conservative MP Andrew Griffith said businesses are already \"on their knees\" due to Labour's \"crippling hikes in business rates\".\"Their plans for a holiday tax will hit families and drive trade away from our towns and communities,\" he added.",

    "body": "4 hours agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandRegan Morris and Peter Bowes,Courthouse in Los Angeles ReutersThe head of Instagram has defended his platform against claims it caused mental health damage to minors, arguing in a California court that even seemingly excessive use of social media does not equal an addiction.Adam Mosseri, who has led Instagram for eight years, testified in the landmark trial that began this week in Los Angeles, making him the first high-profile executive to appear. It is expected to last six weeks, and serve as a test of legal arguments aimed at holding tech firms accountable for impacts on young people.Lawyers for Meta, which owns Instagram, have argued the lead plaintiff in the case, known by her initials K.G.M, was hurt by other things in her life, not Instagram.YouTube is also named in the suit, while Snapchat and TikTok both reached settlements ahead of the trial. One of the top executives at Meta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, Mosseri is expected to be questioned in court all day on Wednesday. Early on in his testimony, he agreed on a broad point made by Mark Lanier, the lead attorney for K.G.M, that Instagram should do everything within its power to help keep users safe on the platform, especially young people.However, Mosseri said he did not think it was possible to say how much Instagram use was too much.Whether use was a problem was \"a personal thing,\" Mosseri said, explaining that one person could use Instagram \"more than you and feel good about it.\"\"It's important to differentiate between clinical addiction and problematic use,\" he added. \"I'm sure I've said that I've been addicted to a Netflix show when I binged it really late one night, but I don't think it's the same thing as clinical addiction.\"Yet, Mosseri repeatedly said he was not an expert in addiction in response to Lanier's questioning.Lanier brought up with Mosseri an internal Meta survey in which the company asked 269,000 Instagram users about their experiences using the app and found 60% had seen or experienced bullying in the previous week.The lawyer added that K.G.M had made over 300 reports to Instagram about bullying on the platform, asking whether Mosseri had been aware of that fact. Mosseri said he had not known.Lanier asked Mosseri what he thought of K.G.M's longest single day of use of Instagram being 16 hours.\"That sounds like problematic use,\" the Instagram boss answered. He did not call it an addiction.  Mosseri was also asked about a 2019 email exchange between Meta executives, in which they discussed the potential negative impact for users caused by a feature allowing people to change their physical appearance in photos.Nick Clegg, who worked as Meta's head of global affairs for several years after more than a decade as a Member of Parliament, was among those to raise concern about the image filters.He said Meta would end up \"rightly accused of putting growth over responsibility,\" which would ultimately have a \"regressive\" impact on the company's reputation.Mosseri said the firm ultimately decided to ban image filters that went beyond mimicking the effects of makeup.After Lanier challenged that claim, Mosseri admitted that the ban on such filters had been \"modified\", while denying it had been lifted completely.Meta and other social media companies, including YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok, are facing thousands of other cases brought by their families, state prosecutors, and school districts across the United States.On his way in, Mosseri was met by a crowd of people outside the courthouse, a mix of onlookers, protestors and parents not involved in the lawsuit, who nevertheless claim to have seen their children suffer from what they say was addiction to social media.Mariano Janin, from London, is one such family member.Holding a photo of his daughter Mia, who died by suicide in 2021 when she was 14, Janin said he travelled to Los Angeles to witness the trial and show his support for the idea that social media use should be restricted for young users.\"If they changed their business model it would be different,\" Janin said. \"They should protect kids. They have the technology; they have the funds.\"Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and Neal Mohan, chief executive of YouTube, are among the other high-profile figures expected to testify in the case.",

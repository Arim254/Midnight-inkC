    "body": "Man who cryogenically froze late wife sparks debate by dating new partner6 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterSouthern China WeeklyA Chinese man who cryogenically froze his dead wife has sparked an online moral debate after Chinese media revealed he had been dating a new girlfriend as his former partner lay preserved in liquid nitrogen.As a sign of his devotion, Gui Junmin decided to freeze his wife Zhan Wenlian's body after she died from lung cancer in 2017, aged 49, making her China's first cryogenically preserved person.But after a November interview revealed he had been dating a different partner since 2020, Chinese social media has been torn on Mr Junmin's predicament.Whilst some asked why the 57-year-old didn't just \"let go\" another commenter remarked he appeared to be \"most devoted to himself\".After Zhan Wenlian was given months to live by doctors, Gui Junmin decided to use cryonics - which is scientifically unproven - to preserve her body once she died.Following her death, he signed a 30-year agreement to preserve his wife's frozen body with the Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research Institute.Since then, Zhan's body has been stored in a 2,000-litre container at the institute in a vat of -190C liquid nitrogen.A 'utilitarian' relationshipChinese newspaper Southern Weekly revealed that although Mr Junmin lived alone for two years after the procedure, in 2020 he began dating again, despite his wife remaining in cryopreservation.He told the newspaper that a severe gout attack which left him unable to move for two days began to change his mind about the benefits of living alone.Soon after, he started seeing his current partner Wang Chunxia, although Mr Junmin suggested to the paper the love was only \"utilitarian\" and that she hadn't \"entered\" his heart.Reacting to the news, some commentators on the Chinese social media site Weibo showed sympathy with Mr Junmin's plight, highlighting how long it had been since his wife was put in the cryogenic chamber.Some believed it was time for him to move on from his frozen former spouse, adding he should, \"let the departed...rest in peace\".But others suggested the he had acted selfishly to only \"satisfy his emotional needs\", with one post questioning \"Would Zhan agree to this? Is it fair to Wang?\".What is cryonics?Cryonics is where the whole body is cooled down to sub-zero temperatures, infused with cryoprotectants - which is similar to antifreeze - to prevent ice crystal formation, then preserved in liquid nitrogen.The hope is that the body can one day be revived when future technology makes this possible.The practice is currently used at a smaller scale in day-to-day medicine, where living cells such as blood cells, sperm and embryos are frozen at ultra-low temperatures to be stored.It's estimated that over 500 people have been cryogenically preserved worldwide, the majority of them in the US.No one has ever been successfully revived following cryopreservation, and scientists believe that preserving and reawakening the complete human body is still a remote possibility.",

    "body": "6 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondent, City of LondonThe Princess of Wales has called for more dignity for carers and a greater respect for values such as \"tenderness\" in business, in her first public speech in two years.At an event in the City of London, Catherine called on 80 top business leaders to play their part in ensuring employees can have healthy family lives, including caring responsibilities.\"I believe in restoring the dignity to the quiet, often invisible work of caring, of loving well, as we look to build a happier, healthier society,\" the princess told the Future Workforce Summit.The event was part of Catherine's campaign to raise awareness about the importance of children's early years and building healthy family relationships.This was Catherine's first speech since November 2023 and the first since her cancer diagnosis, which was revealed in March 2024.Since then, she has delivered recorded messages on social media, including about her gradual recovery after chemotherapy, but this has been the first speech since then to have been delivered in person.It marks another step in her return to public life and also reflects her style, with the event beginning with a poem read by Alex Wharton, former children's laureate for Wales.Her speech, confidently delivered, reflected her deeply-held, personal message about the need for a greater emphasis on kindness and recognising that \"love is the first and most essential bond\".\"The love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\" said the princess.She told business leaders about the need for families to be able to provide a supportive home for their children, as part of what she called the \"weave of love\".The speech was delivered high up in a city skyscraper, with London stretched out below like a model village.Catherine called on business leaders to re-think their workplaces and create a different kind of model for their priorities, in which companies were \"valuing time and tenderness just as much as productivity and success\".The princess, who set up the Centre for Early Childhood before her illness, called for a more rounded way of measuring success.\"As business leaders you will face the daily challenge of finding the balance between profitability and having a positive impact. But the two are not, and should not be incompatible,\" she said.The event also heard from Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School, who said research showed that people who had been in nurturing relationships in early childhood were still likely to be more emotionally secure in their old age.Former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate, addressing this business gathering, said that when he was trying to motivate players, he had found that youngsters from difficult family backgrounds might not have the same level of trust as those who had grown up in closer family relationships.He said that coaches carried out personality profiles on the players to understand the \"way they were wired\".He talked about his own experiences of responding to moments of pressure, using a combination of \"sleep, good nutrition and limiting alcohol\" and breathing exercises to control stress.Sir Gareth also remembered his own recovery after the \"public humiliation\" of missing a penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final when he said \"half the world was watching\".He said that it meant \"slowly taking small steps to recover your confidence\" and he talked of the importance of people, in any type of workplace, being able to \"feel comfortable in your own skin\".This gathering was part of the Business Taskforce set up by the princess to try to get business support for her campaign to recognise the importance of early childhood.Delegates at the event heard from leaders of companies supporting the project including Aviva, NatWest Group, Iceland, Ikea, Lego and Deloitte.",

    "body": "4 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentPalestine ActionOne defendant is accused of striking an officer across the back with his sledgehammerAn alleged Palestine Action member attacked a police officer with a sledgehammer, fracturing her back, during an organised break-in at an Israeli defence firm, a court has heard.Woolwich Crown Court was told that six people accused of breaking in to Elbit Systems near Bristol had meticulously planned the incident on 6 August 2024 to cause as much damage as possible to the factory.Charlotte Head, 29, Samuel Corner, 23, Leona Kamio, 30, Fatema Rajwani, 21, Zoe Rogers, 22, and Jordan Devlin, 31, are jointly accused of aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder.They deny all charges and Mr Corner denies an additional allegation of causing grievous bodily harm.Opening the trial on Tuesday, Mr Justice Johnson told jurors that the allegations they would consider predate Palestine Action's proscription under terrorism laws this June. He added that the ban was not for them to consider and was irrelevant to the evidence in this case.Beginning the prosecution's case, Deanna Heer KC, said that the six defendants had been \"willing participants\" in a plan to cause damage to the plant, which manufacturers defence technology equipment.Wearing red jumpsuits and carrying sledgehammers, they used a prison van, allegedly driven by Charlotte Head, to crash through security fencing, before then breaking into the factory itself, the court heard.Ms Heer told the jury that each of the \"red team\" carried a sledgehammer to cause damage - but they were also prepared to use them as weapons.\"The evidence demonstrates that all of these defendants used them for that purpose, to threaten or to attack the security guards and to lend support to one another as they did so,\" she said.\"When the police arrived, as the defendants knew they would, Samuel Corner attacked them, going so far as to strike a female officer, Sgt Kate Evans, across the back with his sledgehammer while she was on the floor, facing away from him.\"Ms Heer said that the red team had taken three minutes to gain access to factory, first cutting into a roller door and then smashing through it with the prison van.\"Inside the warehouse, the Red Team set about destroying as much property as they could,\" said Ms Heer, adding the group was armed with sledgehammers, whips, and fireworks.'Screamed in pain'\"They used fire extinguishers filled with red paint to spray the walls and floor.\"They used crowbars and hammers to damage computer equipment and boxes of technical products, which they smashed apart.\"The fabric of the building was also damaged, not only the loading bay but also the security systems and even the disabled toilet,\" she added.Footage played in the opening address was said to show Zoe Rogers brandishing and swinging a sledgehammer in front of a security guard, Angelo Volante.He also said he had been whipped by Charlotte Head and threatened with a saw by Leona Kamio.Eventually he retreated - but later returned with the police. As he led officers into the factory, video played to the jury on Tuesday was said to show Ms Kamio raising her sledgehammer over her head and bringing it down towards him.She was then tasered - but continued to resist arrest. The video is then said to show Samuel Corner approaching Sgt Evans and striking her back with a sledgehammer.\"Having hit her once, he raised the sledgehammer again and hit her with it a second time,\" said Ms Heer.\"Fortunately, Sgt Evans was wearing a stab vest which may have absorbed the force of the impacts. Nevertheless she screamed in pain as she felt the force of the blows.\"She was immediately terrified that her spine had been damaged and when she tried, she was unable to get up.\"Sgt Evans suffered a fractured vertebrae and was unable to work for three months. Due to the ongoing impact of the injury, she has been confined to restricted duties.The trial is expected to last until January.Related internet links",

    "body": "A rape survivor said repeated delays to her attacker's trial left her feeling \"resilenced\" and \"not human anymore.\"Morwenna Loughman was violently raped in February 2023 and suffered more than 48 injuries. Her attacker was convicted in August 2025 - more than two years later - but only after the trial was cancelled twice at short notice.Sharing her story with BBC Newsnight, she said she kept going because she had a \"gut instinct that [her attacker] had done this before and he would do it again\", adding: \"We had to stop him\".It comes as new research by the charity Rape Crisis England and Wales found a third of all trials were postponed at least once in 2024 - up from one in 10 in 2015.Ms Loughman, 36, who has chosen to waive her right to anonymity, said hearing that her first court date had been pulled left her \"devastated\" but that she was determined to keep fighting a \"system that is constructed to dismiss you\". She said she also learned that after the first delay, her attacker was repeatedly breaching his bail conditions.\"He could have been anywhere,\" she said.The second delay came after Ms Loughman received a message from police saying the trial was \"all clear\" to go ahead, only for the case to be withdrawn again eight hours later with no explanation.Ms Loughman told Newsnight she became \"a shadow\" of herself, suffering nightmares, flashbacks and acute post-traumatic stress disorder that caused severe vomiting episodes.\"I basically lost my job. I lost my home. My home was a crime scene. I was terrified to be awake, terrified to be asleep because of the nightmares and the flashbacks,\" she said.Rape Crisis England and Wales said the widespread delays in the justice system it found as part of its research were a \"direct cause of retraumatisation\" for victims and left more women and girls at risk of violence and abuse.Justice Minister Sarah Sackman told Newsnight that the situation was \"absolutely unacceptable\" and acknowledged that the criminal courts were \"in a state of crisis\", but added that the government was working to expand courtroom capacity and recruit more staff across the system.\"Justice delayed is justice denied,\" she said.Ministry of Justice data shows that the Crown Court backlog has hit record highs, with more than 78,000 open cases as of June 2025.With her attacker finally convicted, Ms Loughman said she was only now beginning to rebuild her life.\"It's only now that he has been convicted that I can start to feel like myself again,\" she said. \"Being raped violates you in the most horrifying of ways. I couldn't look people in the eye for two-and-a-half years and it is only now then I can start to rebuild my life.\"If you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence, help and support is available at BBC Action Line.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPolice drama Line of Duty is to return to the BBC for a seventh series, with Adrian Dunbar, Vicky McClure and Martin Compston all set to reprise their roles in the hit show.A new six-part series, written by creator Jed Mercurio, will begin filming in Belfast in the spring, the BBC confirmed.McClure said she was \"so excited\" the series was returning, with Dunbar adding: \"What a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year.\"The last series concluded in 2021 with a finale that attracted more than 17 million viewers. Speculation about a return has been rife ever since, but Mercurio and the BBC have not confirmed it until now.The BBC has not yet announced when the new season will hit screens.The finale of series six drew the show's long-running storyline about the hunt for criminal mastermind known as \"H\" to a close, and the BBC and creative team behind the show said at the time there were no plans for any further series. However, the corporation confirmed on Tuesday that a seventh series is now in development.Series seven will open with AC-12 having been disbanded and rebranded the Inspectorate of Police Standards, the BBC confirmed.Steve Arnott (Compston), Kate Fleming (McClure) and Ted Hastings (Dunbar) are still working to tackle corruption in the police force.The BBC said their line of work \"has never been more difficult, and, in this challenging climate, [the trio] are assigned their most sensitive case so far\".A new character, Det Insp Dominic Gough, a charismatic officer celebrated for a string of takedowns of organised crime, is accused of abusing his position to act as a sexual predator. But his case could be a deliberate distraction from a bigger threat still operating in the shadows, the announcement teased.In a statement, Mercurio said: \"Everyone involved in Line of Duty feels enormous gratitude to the show's fans. \"We're privileged to have had so many of you follow the ups and downs of AC-12 over six previous seasons and we couldn't be more delighted to be returning for a seventh.\"He added: \"Corruption in this country is supposed to have come to an end while Line of Duty was off air so I've been forced to use my imagination.\"Line of Duty launched in 2012 and went on to become one of the most popular TV drams of the last decade, attracting guest stars such as Stephen Graham, Thandiwe Newton, Kelly Macdonald and Lennie James.Compston described appearing in the police drama as \"a job of a lifetime\". \"Not only in terms of the show's success but the people I've had the opportunity to work with I now call some of my closest friends.\"I can't wait to pull the waistcoat on again and get the team back together,\" he said.McClure added: \"It goes without saying I'm so excited Line of Duty is back! Can't wait to work with Jed, Martin and Adrian again. Belfast, we'll see you soon!\"Dunbar remarked: \"As we count down the AC-12 days of Christmas what a joy it is to know that the Three Amigos will be back filming together next year. \"Delighted with the news and looking forward to those mercurial twists and turns.\"",

Your voice, your memory, and your spirit will continue to inspire all of us in the AJR - and beyond - for generations to come.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoAdam Easton,Warsaw correspondent and Jaroslav LukivTwo Ukrainian citizens who long worked for Russian intelligence have been identified as the suspects behind two acts of sabotage on Poland's rail network, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said.One suspect had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in Ukraine, Tusk told parliament.On Monday, he visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border at the weekend, and called it an \"unprecedented act of sabotage\".Another incident down the line near Pulawy on Monday forced a packed train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.The Kremlin brushed off suggestions of Russian involvement.Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said: \"It would have been really strange, if Russia hadn't been blamed first.\"\"Russia is accused of all acts of hybrid and direct war... in Poland,\" he told Russia's state-run media, adding: \"Russophobia is certainly rampant there.\"Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that the two acts of sabotage on the Warsaw-Lublin railway line had been ordered by a \"foreign service\". Then a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that \"everything points to them being Russian special services\".\"The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,\" Tusk told MPs.The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.Tusk said that a military-grade C4 explosive device had been detonated on 15 November at about 21:00 (20:00 GMT) near the village of Mika.The explosion, which happened as a freight train was passing, caused minor damage to a wagon floor. It was captured on CCTV.Tusk said the train driver had not even noticed the incident.A previous attempt to derail a train by placing a steel clamp on the rail had failed, he added.The second act of sabotage, on 17 November, involved a train carrying 475 passengers having to suddenly brake because of damaged railway infrastructure, said Tusk.The prime minister also said he would issue an order later on Tuesday to raise the alert level on certain railway lines.He said since the start of last year 55 people had been detained on suspicion of assisting, preparing, or committing acts of sabotage and that 23 of them had been remanded in custody.Russia's motivation, Tusk went on, was to sow panic and stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Polish society, which is home to more than one million Ukrainian war refugees.\"I want to emphasise that what the Russian authorities care about is not only the direct effect of this type of action, but also the social and political consequences of the fact that this action is taking place,\" he said.\"This of course means disorganisation, chaos, panic, speculation and uncertainty.\"Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.In September, Tusk said three Russian drones had been shot down by Polish and other Nato aircraft in Poland's airspace during overnight attacks on Ukraine.He said at the time that authorities had recorded 19 drone incursions, with some flying deep enough to temporarily close four airports, including Warsaw's main hub Chopin.Russia's defence ministry responded by saying there had been \"no plans\" to target facilities on Polish soil.",

    "body": "'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance20 hours agoChi Chi Izundu & Rebecca ThornBBC Global WomenBBCArden Cho stars as the voice of Rumi in KPop Demon Hunters, which topped Netflix charts in 93 countries\"I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,\" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.\"Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,\" she says.These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.\"I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.\"As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.\"NetflixCho says the film has led to \"Korea being loved\" more than ever beforeWhen it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho \"a dream come true\" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's \"such a refreshing moment\", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.\"I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,\" Cho says.But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were \"sometimes facing an uphill battle\".\"I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,\" she says.So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.Getty ImagesJi-Young Yoo (left) and May Hong (right) are also voice actors in the filmThe film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, targeting those who are in the country illegally, which sparked protests in many states.As an Asian-American living in the US \"it's heartbreaking and disappointing,\" says Cho. \"Immigrants have made America what it is.\"Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.Cho says that when she was younger, people didn't know what it meant to be Korean in the USAs an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.\"But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,\" she says.Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring \"hope and joy and love to all these different communities\".\"Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.\"The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to \"have hope in humanity\" that people will still seek out art created by humans.\"Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.\"KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.\"I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,\" she says. \"So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't.\"Starting conversations, building connections and challenging misinformation through features, investigations, interviews and extraordinary stories",

    "body": "4 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorReutersA rescue proposal by lenders to Thames Water has been criticised by other potential bidders, frustrated to have been frozen out of talks on the future of the UK's biggest water utility.Thames Water is running out of money and is living on an emergency lifeline from the group of lenders that are collectively owed more than £13bn.Hong Kong-based CKI Holdings and UK-based Castle Water have both complained their competing offers have been shut out by the existing lenders' group who they say are keen to minimise their losses.Without a rescue, the UK's largest water utility will collapse into a government supervised administration process by early next year.The future of Thames Water hangs in the balance. The water and waste utility that serves 16 million people is nearly £20bn in debt and living off an emergency loan granted by its existing lenders keen to stave off collapse.Those lenders – now known as London and Valley Water - are locked in exclusive talks with regulators and the government over a rescue proposal.This plan would see 25% of their debts written off and more than £4bn of new cash injected, but will require years of leniency on fines for pollution incidents. If Thames Water collapses into administration, those debts could be written off by a greater amount.But other potential bidders have expressed frustration that this group of lenders  has effective control of the company and has used that position to shut out rival - and, they argue, better - proposals.CKI Holdings is already an owner of Northumbrian Water and UK Power Networks. An analysis by Barclays says that Thames' customer bills could be nearly 20% higher in five years' time if a rescue plan proposed by lenders to the stricken utility is approved.Barclays' research calculates that the lenders' proposal requires customers to bear some of the future operational and financial risks to the company, adding £116 to bills when they are revised in 2030, and require additional leniency from the regulator from fines over sewage and spills.The Barclays research note is aimed at potential investors in CKI. The lender consortium told the BBC it rejected both the basis and the conclusion of what sources described as \"a note designed to curry favour with an existing or potential clients\", and insisted that CKI had been given every chance to make a compelling bid earlier in the process.A spokesperson for the bondholders told the BBC: \"We reject these misleading statements and do not recognise the assumptions they are based on.\"We have always said that customer bills will remain in line with those contemplated in the Final Determination (pricing plan laid out by Ofwat earlier this year) for the next five years.\"Having been given multiple opportunities throughout a 12-month competitive equity process, CKI did not put forward a viable proposal to fix Thames Water's complex problems.\"Even if CKI was offered a fresh chance to bid, Barclays concedes that the sale of critical infrastructure to a China-linked owner would raise questions of national security.The report references concerns raised by Sir Simon Gass, former head of the Joint Intelligence Committee, that a sale to CKI would potentially give Beijing access to sensitive consumer data.Separately, independent water retailer Castle Water has said it is prepared to inject an extra £1bn into Thames than the proposal by London and Valley Water.A spokesperson for Castle Water told the BBC: \"Our approach is based on increased upfront investment that will overhaul the assets and infrastructure that is currently undermining Thames' performance and deliver the sort of step change in service delivery that customers deserve. \"It will also address head on the issue of pollution. When it comes to pollution, you simply cannot compromise.\"However, Castle Water concedes that its proposal is not a formal bid at this stage and sources close to London and Valley and Thames Water itself have questioned the bid's credibility.Getty ImagesIt is not just would-be bidders who are critical of the current process.Economist and infrastructure expert Prof Dieter Helm has also argued that the current debt holders' primary concern is to limit the extent to which their existing loans are written off and not the long-term interests of the company and its customers.\"What the plan represents is a way to salvage as much money as possible for these key bondholders,\" he says.He adds the bondholders' plan does not contemplate a return to normal performance standards on sewage spills and leaks for another 10-15 years.Prof Helm argues the best way to get a fresh start for Thames is through a  government-supervised administration - a so-called Special Administration Regime (SAR) - that would see a much bigger debt write-off than the 25% the current lenders are proposing.The government is keen to avoid an SAR as, although the public purse would eventually be reimbursed through a sale, it could cost billions in the short to medium term for a chancellor struggling to find enough money to stick to her own tax and spending rules.The consortium of bondholders are hopeful that discussions with Ofwat and the Treasury will result in an outline agreement in December.

    "body": "12 hours agoJenny Kumah and Malcolm Prior,BBC News rural affairs teamTom MasonThe South West Wildcat Project hopes to bring back 50 European wildcats across the mid-Devon countrysideWildcats – one of the UK's most critically endangered mammals – could make a return from extinction in England, conservationists say.The South West Wildcat Project hopes to bring back 50 European wildcats, from 2028, after a study found a colony could \"flourish\" in the mid-Devon countryside.Reintroduction plans follow a breeding scheme to boost numbers in Scotland but there are concerns that the carnivores could pose a threat to poultry, gamebirds and native bird species, as well as a risk of cross-breeding with domestic cats.The Countryside Alliance said that if that risk was not dealt with, ambitions to sustain a genetically pure wildcat population would be \"doomed to failure\".Malcolm Prior/BBCWildcats – historically also known as 'woodcats' – were once widespread in Great BritainThe South West Wildlife Project – a partnership led by Devon Wildlife Trust - said independent research by the University of Exeter showed that about 80% of people asked were positive about wildcat reintroduction.But Oliver Edwards, a beef and sheep farmer on Exmoor, told the BBC he was concerned that reintroducing a predatory species would have \"a detrimental effect on the animals and bird life that live here already\".\"They say wildcats live on voles. Well, voles are feeding my barn owls so if you reduce the vole population you are having an effect on the barn owls,\" he explained.He added that there needed to be wider consultation with farmers and landowners about the best areas to reintroduce the wildcats.European wildcats – historically also known as woodcats – were once widespread in Great Britain until human persecution and the loss of woodland and rough grass habitats saw them disappear from England and Wales.Today, the UK's only remaining wildcat population lives in the Highlands of Scotland but, despite being given protected status in 1988, they are now classed as critically endangered and at risk of UK extinction, with as few as 115 remaining in the wild.Malcolm Prior/BBCCath Jeffs, from Devon Wildlife Trust, said measures taken to stop other predators from targeting farmed birds would work for wildcats.Cath Jeffs, the South West Wildcat Project lead for Devon Wildlife Trust, said the team would continue to work closely with locals to deal with any concerns or issues raised over the phased reintroduction and that specific locations had yet to be decided.She pointed out that most measures taken to stop predators like foxes from targeting poultry or gamebirds would work for wildcats.She added that it was unlikely there would be a population explosion as wildcats live in low density numbers over wider areas and they would be closely monitored and managed. \"We are absolutely committed to making this happen, but in the right way and at the right time,\" she added.The south west of England has been identified as a prime site for reintroduction because of the woodland cover it offers across mid-Devon, connected by other habitats that suit wildcats.But some critics have suggested the area is more populated than parts of the Highlands where they have been reintroduced before.They said that could lead to the wildcats breeding with feral domestic cats, with such interbreeding – also known as hybridisation - undermining the whole idea of bringing back the species.Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the organisation was not opposed to \"properly planned and managed reintroduction\".But he said there were concerns about the ability to sustain a \"genetically pure\" population of wildcat because of the threat of hybridisation.\"Reintroducing wildcats in the south-west without addressing this issue would seem to be doomed to failure,\" he said.A spokeswoman for the Devon Wildlife Trust said they would tackle the threat of hybridisation by working with local welfare organisations to support a neutering programme for feral and domestic cats in areas where wildcats were introduced.",

    "body": "12 minutes agoJennifer McKiernan,Political reporter, Frank Gardner,Security correspondent and Kate Whannel,Political reporterHouse of CommonsSecurity minister Dan Jarvis has said the government will not tolerate \"covert and calculated\" attempts to interfere with the UK's sovereign affairs, after MI5 warned MPs of the risk from Chinese spies.An alert issued to MPs, peers and parliamentary staff by security services identified two LinkedIn profiles, which it says are used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).It says they act as \"civilian recruitment headhunters\", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit \"insider insights\".A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said accusations of espionage were \"pure fabrication\" and accused the UK of a \"self-staged charade\".\"We strongly condemn such despicable moves of the UK side and have lodged stern representations with them,\" the spokesperson said.They urged the UK to \"stop going further down the wrong path of undermining China-UK relations\".Jarvis announced a package of measures in the House of Commons to tackle espionage threats to the UK.These included £170m to upgrade encrypted technology for government business, as well as new protections against Chinese cybercrime and attempts to influence UK university research.Jarvis told MPs: \"Our intelligence agencies have warned that China is attempting to recruit and cultivate individuals with access to sensitive information about Parliament and the UK government.\"He added: \"This activity involves a covert and calculated attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our sovereign affairs in favour of its own interests, and this government will not tolerate it.\"He warned China had a \"low threshold\" for what information is useful, as it attempts to build a wider picture.Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, circulated the MI5 warning to MPs and peers on Tuesday.The alert specifically identified two LinkedIn profiles set up with the names Amanda Qiu and Shirly Shen.In his letter to MPs, Sir Lindsay said both profiles were being used \"to conduct outreach at scale\" on behalf of the Chinese MSS.The BBC has contacted both for a response, although it is not clear if the women named and pictured on the networking site are the actual account holders.LinkedInLinkedInWriting to MPs, Sir Lindsay said Chinese state actors were \"relentless\" in trying to \"interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament\".He said the Chinese MSS was \"actively reaching out to individuals in our community\", and that they wanted to \"collect information and lay the groundwork for long-term relationships, using professional networking sites, recruitment agents and consultants acting on their behalf\".Other elements of espionage described in the MI5 alert include all-expenses paid trips to China, and payment for information through cash or cryptocurrency.Targets are said to include \"Parliament staff, economists, think tank employees, geo-political consultants and those working alongside [the government] including MPs and members of the House of Lords\".Jarvis highlighted a pattern of behaviour around Chinese spying attempts, which he said he would take \"all necessary measures\" to protect against, including updating and strengthening national security powers.He said rules will be tightened to tackle covert funding of political parties, while the Electoral Commission will be given greater enforcement powers. There will also be security briefings for all parties and candidates standing in the elections next May for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Senedd, and councils across England.Stressing that China is still the UK's third biggest trading partner, Jarvis said the UK would nevertheless use sanctions \"as necessary\".Conservative shadow Home Office minister Alicia Kearns urged the government to increase transparency of China's activities in the UK by putting the country on the enhanced tier of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS).Currently only Iran and Russia are in the enhanced tier, meaning someone cannot carry out work for the countries until they have registered their activity with the government.  Kearns also said the government should cancel planned visits to China and reject an application to build a Chinese embassy at a sensitive location in central London.Jarvis said the government was \"looking closely at whether it is necessary to make further additions onto the enhanced tier\" for FIRS but added that \"no decision has yet been made\".On the embassy, he said the decision would be made by the housing secretary.Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the alert showed China was taking an \"aggressive position\" that \"blows a hole through all of that ridiculous nonsense\" about whether or not China was a threat to UK national security.\"We have to be much, much more vigilant,\" he told BBC News.\"Why is the government so unable to call China what it is, which is a persistent, continuing threat to Britain's national security.\"That is clear to every single member of the public… but somehow the government seems to think it isn't that clear.\"While it is accepted that all countries spy on each other, the scale of China's activities has caused increasing concern in recent years. Whitehall officials have warned of Chinese cyber attacks, intellectual property theft and attempts to recruit British individuals in Parliament and the technology sector. In 2022, MI5 issued an \"interference alert\" about the activities of alleged Chinese agent Christina Lee, who was believed to have infiltrated Parliament. Ms Lee denied the allegations. China is also believed to be gathering bulk data on the UK population including accessing data sets that contain financial, personal or health information.Earlier this year, MI5 boss Ken McCallum warned that Chinese state actors posed a daily national security threat to the UK.In September, a case involving two men accused of spying for China collapsed in controversial circumstances. One of the men was a parliamentary researcher. Both men denied wrongdoing.The head of the Crown Prosecution Service said the case collapsed because it could not get evidence from the government referring to China as a national security threat. However, some legal experts have questioned whether the CPS would have needed this evidence to go ahead with the prosecution.",

He was placed in an induced coma for several months before his condition improved, the court was told. A third man, 45-year-old Mohammed Amjid Shabir, had driven Mr Ali and Mr Sunderland to the scene and would have been on trial with the other two men, the jury was told, but had since died from natural causes.'Exploded into life'Mr Brooke said Antonia had been in a relationship with Mr Ali for seven years, describing it as \"an abusive relationship exacerbated by his drinking\".She decided to separate from him in August and stayed with her sister, the jury was told.Doorbell footage from the night of the fire displayed Mr Sunderland, of Calton Street, carrying a canister containing seven litres of petrol.Mr Sunderland was heard being ordered by Mr Ali to \"kick the door in\", with Mr Sunderland then running back to the car.The footage captured the moment the fire started and an explosion at the house.Dozens of tributes were left outside the scene of the fire The jury was told that Antonia had gone downstairs at the property when she heard noises at the front door and Mr Ali subsequently poured petrol on her.The court heard that she tried to get the petrol and a lighter from him, before running outside shouting for help in the hope that he would follow.The prosecution said Antonia ran back to the house and saw her sister on the stairs kicking Mr Ali before a fire engulfed \"himself, the stairs and her sister\".The fire \"exploded into life\", the court heard, with screaming heard on the doorbell footage.Bryonie and her three children were brought out of the house by firefighters and police, the jury was told, but it was too late to save them despite their efforts.In a written statement to police, Mr Sunderland had denied knowing what Mr Ali was going to do and said his co-defendant was drunk, not making sense and described him as \"a bully\".The trial continues.Related links",

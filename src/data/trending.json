    "body": "20 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "Italian cooking has been awarded special cultural heritage status by the United Nations' cultural agency Unesco. National favourites including pizza are already on Unesco's list of \"intangible cultural heritage\", but now Italian cooking traditions and the way they are practiced and transmitted have been awarded. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been pushing for her country's cuisine to be recognised since her election, said: \"For us Italians, cuisine is not just food or a collection of recipes. It is so much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth.\" For millions of fans the news confirms what they already believed - from Sicilian Cannoli to Calabrian 'Nduja - Italian is the best. The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. \"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage.

    "body": "20 minutes agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterOlympic medal-winning swimmer and campaigner Sharron Davies has been named as one of three new Conservative peers.Ms Davies, a vocal critic of trans women in women's sport, was nominated by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.The Tories said it was in recognition of her sporting achievements and her campaigning on women's rights. Iceland supermarket chairman Richard Walker and former Number 10 communications director Matthew Doyle are among 25 new Labour peers nominated by Sir Keir Starmer. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey nominated five new peers.Ms Davies will sit alongside ex-Tory cabinet minister John Redwood and journalist and historian Simon Heffer - who have also been handed peerages.She has become an outspoken campaigner against allowing transgender athletes in female competitions in order to \"protect women's sport\".The swimmer, who won a silver medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and two Commonwealth golds, denied that her comments were transphobic and claimed she had spoken to many other female athletes who \"feel the same way as me\".Following her nomination, Ms Davies said it would be \"exciting to carry on fighting for women's rights and safeguarding as well as trying to get as many kids, in particular, doing sport as possible\".Meanwhile, a Labour spokesperson said their new 25 peers would allow the government to \"deliver on our mandate from the British people\" and \"correct\" the imbalance against  Labour in the House of Lords, where the Tories currently have more representation.Despite having a majority in the House of Commons, Labour is currently outnumbered in the Lords, with 209 peers to the Tories' 282.Mr Walker's nomination confirms reports earlier in the week from Labour sources calling him \"a committed champion of families dealing with the cost of living\".The 45-year-old left the Conservative Party in 2023, and was later seen at the launch of Labour's manifesto for the 2024 general election.In February this year, he gave the new government a score of \"six out of 10\" in comments to the Financial Times, taking issue with it raising employer national insurance contributions but praising its attempts to improve relations with the EU.A Labour spokesperson said: \"⁠The Tories stuffed the House of Lords, creating a serious imbalance that has allowed them to frustrate our plans to make working families better off.\"We will continue to progress our programme of reform, which includes removing the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords.\"Labour is in the process of abolishing 92 seats reserved for hereditary peers - who inherit their titles through their families.Sir Keir Starmer has previously come out in favour of abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected Assembly of the Nations and Regions, but has not put forward deeper reforms before the next election.Labour’s election manifesto called House of Lords reform \"long overdue\" and \"essential\" as the chamber is too large and many peers fail to serve democracy.Among the new Labour peers are Mr Doyle, a veteran of the Tony Blair government who resigned in March after nine months leading Downing Street's press operation. Rachel Reeves's ex-chief of staff Katie Martin, was also given a peerage.Labour nominated several senior London-based political figures including Len Duvall, chair of the London Assembly, Mayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres and ex-leader of Southwark Council Peter John.The Lib Dems nominated Lord Addington and Earl Russell, both hereditary peers, letting them stay in the House of Lords after those seats are abolished.The Earl of Kinnoull, one of the deputy speakers of the House of Lords, has also been awarded a peerage to remain as an independent crossbencher.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had appointed members who will work to \"deliver the change our country desperately needs, including reform of the House of Lords\".They include ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather, who served as children's minister between 2010 and 2012, and Rhiannon Leaman who has been Sir Ed's chief of staff since 2019.Most Lords are entitled to a £371 daily allowance for each sitting day they attend - although they can choose not to claim it.",

    "body": "21 minutes agoMaia Davies & Anna LamcheA member of the UK armed forces who died in Ukraine has been named as Lance Corporal George Hooley of the Parachute Regiment.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid tribute to the 28-year-old paratrooper, saying he had lived a life \"full of courage and determination\".\"He served our country with honour and distinction around the world in the cause of freedom and democracy, including as part of the small number of British personnel in Ukraine.\"The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said he had been killed in a \"tragic accident\" while observing Ukrainian forces test \"a new defensive capability, away from the front lines\" on Tuesday.Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Keir said he had placed L/Cpl Hooley's name on record \"to express our gratitude and respect, and to affirm that his service will never be forgotten\".L/Cpl Hooley had an \"incredibly bright\" future, his commanding officer said in a tribute on Wednesday.\"I have no doubt that he would have continued to perform at the very front of his peer group over the coming years,\" the commanding officer said, adding that \"all members of the Parachute Regiment mourn his loss\".The 28-year-old's company commander added: \"If you met George Hooley, you remembered it. His energy and enthusiasm were simply extraordinary.\"He provided spark that lifted others, a drive that inspired, and a zest for life that reminded us all how to live with purpose and joy. And we loved him for it. George had a rare gift: a deep kindness and genuine time for everyone.\"He was \"the model of professionalism\" and a \"born soldier\", the company commander added.\"His colleagues will tell you that he wasn't just part of the team, he was the character within it. The glue. The laughter. The calm voice of sense. The soldier who made the hard days easy and the good days memorable.\"The paratrooper was due to be promoted to Corporal in January and had been given the role's responsibilities on his deployment to Ukraine, the MoD said.He had previously been deployed to Afghanistan, Africa and Eastern Europe.Defence Secretary John Healey shared his condolences with L/Cpl Hooley's family and colleagues. He said: \"He served our country with distinction. His tragic death reminds us of the courage and commitment with which our outstanding armed forces serve every day.\"The BBC understands the incident is not thought to have been caused by hostile fire. A military source told the BBC two Ukrainian personnel were believed to have died in the incident, and several more were injured.The weapons system being tested was said to be an armed interceptor drone, according to unconfirmed reports.Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment.It is not known what L/Cpl Hooley's role was in the country. This is the first time the presence of paratroopers in Ukraine has been confirmed.The UK government has never disclosed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number is there to support Ukrainian armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.The Parachute Regiment is an airborne infantry regiment of the British Army.It has not been confirmed in which battalion L/Cpl Hooley served. The first battalion is under the direction of special forces, while others are part of the Army's rapid response formation.It is the first death of a UK service member in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.The Parachute Regiment said it was mourning the death of the 28-year-old, who joined the British Army in November 2015.He joined the Regiment in June 2016 after completing his training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in North Yorkshire, it said in a statement on social media.A series of meetings to bring the war in Ukraine to an end have taken place in recent weeks, following interventions from US President Donald Trump and a range of European leaders.Sir Keir told the Commons he had met Ukraine's President Zelensky in Downing Street on Monday, alongside France's President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as efforts to negotiate an end to the war intensify.\"We must redouble our efforts,\" he told the House.\"The UK, Europe and our allies will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, stand up to Putin's aggression and work to deliver a just and lasting peace.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also speaking in the Commons, said: \"The thoughts of the whole House will rightly be with family of Lance Corporal Hooley, who tragically died supporting Ukraine in her fight for freedom.\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who welcomed Healey to Washington DC for defence talks on Wednesday, also paid tribute to L/Cpl Hooley, saying: \"It is a reflection of the sacrifice and commitment that so many make around the world.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoMahfouz Zubaide,Afghanistan producerandMattea BubaloFour Afghan men were ordered to report to the Taliban government's department of vice and virtue for dressing in costumes inspired by the TV series Peaky Blinders.The friends were told that their clothing was \"in conflict with Afghan and Islamic values\", a Taliban spokesman told the BBC, adding the values in Peaky Blinders went against Afghan culture.In videos posted online, the men, who have been released, can be seen posing in flat caps and three-piece suits similar to those worn in the series set in England soon after World War One.Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, they have imposed a number of restrictions on daily life in accordance with their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.\"Even jeans would have been acceptable, but the values in the Peaky Blinders series are against Afghan culture,\" Saiful Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Taliban government's provincial department of Vice and Virtue in Herat city told the BBC.The men, all in their early twenties, come from the town of Jibrail in Herat province. They were ordered to report to the Taliban's \"morality police\" on Sunday, and presented themselves for questioning in Herat the following day.\"They were promoting foreign culture and imitating film actors in Herat,\" Khyber wrote on social media, adding that they had undergone a \"rehabilitation programme\". They were not formally arrested, \"only summoned and advised and released\", Khyber told the BBC's US partner CBS News.\"We have our own religious and cultural values, and especially for clothing we have specific traditional styles,\" he said.\"The clothing they wore has no Afghan identity at all and does not match our culture. Secondly, their actions were an imitation of actors from a British movie. Our society is Muslim; if we are to follow or imitate someone, we should follow our righteous religious predecessors in good and lawful matters.\"The men could be seen thanking officials for their advice and saying they were unaware they had violated any laws in a video released by the ministry after they were questioned - though it is unclear under what circumstances the interview was recorded. \"I have innocently been sharing content that was against Sharia which had many viewers,\" one said in the recording.He said he had been \"summoned and advised\", and would no longer do \"anything like this\".In an interview with YouTube channel Herat-Mic uploaded at the end of November, before they were summoned, the friends said they admired the fashion displayed in the series, adding that they had received positive reactions from locals.\"At first we were hesitant, but once we went outside, people liked our style, stopped us in the streets, and wanted to take photos with us,\" one of the men said, according to a translation by CBS News.",

She will be missed so much our hearts are breaking.\"'Unique voice'A statement from Kinsella's publisher said she \"defined and elevated romantic comedy by populating her stories with real-life issues that combined wit, emotional depth and societal insight\".Bill Scott-Kerr, her longstanding publisher at Transworld, described Kinsella as \"our author, our cheerleader, our fellow conspirator and our friend\".He added: \"Maddy leaves behind a glorious and indelible legacy, a unique voice, an unquenchable spirit, a goodness of intent and a body of work that will continue to inspire us to reach higher and be better, just like so many of her characters.\"British romantic comedy writer Jill Mansell offered: \"Maddy was a brilliant writer but more importantly a truly lovely person.\"In both respects she brought so much joy to the world.\"Sarah CresswellThe author's agents Araminta Whitley and Marina de Pass described Kinsella as \"an intelligent, imaginative, loving and irreverent woman who valued the deeply connective power of fiction\".\"She had a rare gift for creating emotionally resonant protagonists and stories that spoke to, and entertained, readers wherever they were in the world and whatever challenges they faced.\"They added: \"She also had an unmatched wit and ability to find the funny side. \"Comedy, for her, was both an art form and an intellectual pursuit and she instinctively understood that it is often a tightrope act of balancing light with dark.\"Moyes agreed, telling the BBC: \"The big mistake people make with Sophie's books is they assume they were easy [to write] because they're easy to read.\"But anybody who's tried to replicate them knows that she was a master plotter, and a master at characterisation. She was a genius, actually.\"Getty ImagesKinsella wrote last year that she had \"always processed my life through writing\"Kinsella was born in London in 1969, and studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to philosophy, politics and economics. She wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, aged 24 under her married name Madeleine Wickham, while working as a financial journalist.\"My overriding concern was that I didn't write the autobiographical first novel,\" she told the Guardian in 2012. \"I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. \"It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I'm not just writing about my life, I'm a real author.\"The book was acclaimed by critics and became a top 10 bestseller. She released six further novels as Madeleine Wickham.Five years later, writing as Sophie Kinsella, she published The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic.It introduced readers to Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist who is a serial shopper and hopeless when it comes to her own finances, often buying new clothes or shoes on her credit card rather than saving her money.\"I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,\" Kinsella said of her bestselling series.The first two novels in the series were adapted for the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic, starring Isla Fisher.Getty ImagesA film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic starring Isla Fisher was released in 2009After its huge success, Kinsella went on to write eight further Shopaholic novels and a short story, and another 18 books in total, including one young adult novel and four children's books.Kinsella's other works include Can You Keep A Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess.Her books were occasionally referred to as \"chick lit\" - a description she did not fully endorse\"When I hear the term 'chick lit', I feel a pinprick of, not annoyance but of slight resignation,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2018. \"'Oh, this again…' \"I've never had anyone say to my face, 'Your books are inferior,' but if people say, 'Your books are beach reads,' I say, 'Yep, that's fine by me. Read them on the beach!'\"Kinsella's most recent novella, What Does It Feel Like?, published in October 2024, was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, written after she had surgery.In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing\".\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe.\"Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry and their five children.What is a glioblastoma?Glioblastomas are the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.About 3,200 people are diagnosed with a glioblastoma every year in the UK. Of these, just 160 survive for five years or more.It's a type of cancer that grows quickly - glioblastomas are likely to spread within the brain and come back even after being removed.Symptoms vary, but can include headaches caused by a build-up of pressure, personality changes, and memory problems. People may also have trouble speaking or experience extreme tiredness, depression, seizures and sight problems.Common treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or if a patient is well enough, a surgeon will try to remove as much cancer as possible during an operation.",

    "body": "2 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterToffee Crisp and Blue Riband bars can no longer be called chocolate after maker Nestle changed their recipes.To be described as milk chocolate in the UK a product needs to have at least 20% cocoa solids and 20% milk solids, a level each product fell below once a higher amount of cheaper vegetable fat was used.Nestle said its reformulations were needed due to higher input costs but were \"carefully developed and sensory tested\" and there were no plans to alter the recipes of other chocolate products.As many ingredient costs, such as cocoa and butter, increased food companies have altered recipes to use less of the expensive ingredients, as well as shrinking serving sizes.Nestle now describes the treats as being \"encased in a smooth milk chocolate flavour coating\" rather than being covered in milk chocolate.A spokesperson for Nestle said the food giant had seen \"significant increases in the cost of cocoa over the past years, making it much more expensive to manufacture our products. We continue to be more efficient and absorb increasing costs where possible\".The change to the bars' ingredients was first reported by The Grocer.Nestle is not alone in recent reformulations. In October, McVitie's Penguin and Club bars switched to be labelled as as \"chocolate flavour\" because the amount of cocoa they contain has been reduced after parent company Pladis chose to use cheaper alternatives to the main ingredient in chocolate.Although cocoa commodity prices have recently eased slightly, a surge in costs over the past three years, driven by poor harvests and droughts, has pushed up the cost of chocolate.Changing ingredient proportions in food and drink manufacturing due to cost is sometimes called \"skimpflation\". It has become more common in recent years as inflation has increased producers' costs.Supermarkets were found in 2024 to have reduced the amount of costlier ingredients such as beef and chicken in their ready meals.",

    "body": "9 hours agoAnna LamcheGCHQFans of codebreaking, maths and brainteasers can now try their hand at the latest cryptic Christmas challenge set by GCHQ, the UK's intelligence agency.GCHQ released its annual Christmas card on Wednesday, filled with puzzles and hidden codes designed to help children aged 11-18 hone a range of skills \"they might need to become a spy\".The card was created by \"schoolchildren as well as spies\", according to GCHQ, after hundreds of young people entered a design competition in the lead-up to the festive period.It contains seven puzzles set by \"GCHQ's in-house puzzlers\", geared towards testing a range of problem-solving skills including intuitive reasoning and lateral thinking.Students were asked to draw their response to the question: \"What do you think GCHQ looks like on Christmas Day?\". They were challenged to embed hidden codes and ciphers into their designs.Three winners were selected by a panel of judges across three age groups.The famously tricky puzzles \"aren't meant to be solved alone\", GCHQ said, adding: \"We believe the right mix of minds means we can solve seemingly impossible problems.\"\"Puzzles are at the heart of GCHQ's work to keep the country safe from hostile states, terrorists and criminals; challenging our teams to think creatively and analytically every day\", said GCHQ Director Anne Keast-Butler.She said she hoped the puzzle encourages the next generation \"to explore STEM subjects and consider the rewarding careers available in cybersecurity and intelligence\".Meanwhile, the spy agency's \"Chief Puzzler\", known only as \"Colin\", said the puzzles are designed to test \"the same blend of skills our teams use every day to keep the country safe.\"Answers will be released on Wednesday evening.Question 1:Somewhere on the card is a special seven letter word which has no repeated letters, and no letters which are next to each other in the alphabet. Can you find it? Question 2:There is some driftwood in these streams... but where should it be?Question 3:The robber has to find a route through the house. He can't go through the same coloured door twice in a row, and cannot move against any arrows. Eventually he gets caught by the police. How was he acting?Question 4:My gifts from Santa are wrapped in pairs this year – but which one is missing?Question 5:The letters in TWO UV PAIRS have the values 0,1,2,…,9 in some order, with each letter representing a different digit.What is 1234567 ?Question 6:Solve this code. It has lots of four-letter words!Question 7:Find an appropriate 7-letter word...✓ = letter in right place ?? = letter present, but in the wrong place",

    "body": "1 hour agoDominic CascianiHome and legal correspondentGetty ImagesAccording to the lawyers, two of the group had refused food for 37 days as of Tuesday and five have spent periods in hospitalLawyers for eight remand prisoners who are on hunger strike while waiting to go on trial for alleged offences relating to Palestine Action are calling for an urgent meeting with ministers.In a letter seen by the BBC, the lawyers tell Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy that there is a \"real and increasingly likely potential\" their clients will die in prison as part of their protest.Two of the defendants had been refusing food for 37 days and five of the group have spent periods in hospital, according to the letter.Earlier, MPs John McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn told the Commons Speaker that ministers had not responded to requests for information about the protests.A Ministry of Justice (MoJ) spokesperson said: \"The deputy prime minister has responded to and will continue to respond to correspondence on this issue, and is being kept informed of the situation.\"\"We continually assess prisoners' wellbeing and will always take the appropriate action, including taking prisoners to hospital if they are assessed as needing treatment by a medical professional.\"The protests taking place in five different prisons involve eight people who have all been charged with offences relating to alleged break-ins or criminal damage on behalf of Palestine Action, charges that are denied, before the group was banned under terrorism legislation.Four of the group are accused of playing roles in the break-in to an Israeli-linked defence firm in 2024 and are due to go on trial in May next year at the earliest.The other four are accused of breaking into RAF Brize Norton in June, where it is alleged they caused millions of pounds worth of damage to two military jets.Prisoners for PalestineSix of the group are said to have refused food since early November. L-R: Kamran Ahmed, Teuta Hoxha, Qesser Zuhrah, Amy Gardiner-Gibson, Heba Muraisi, and Jon CinkIn the letter sent to Lammy on Tuesday, lawyers for Qesser Zuhrah, Amy Gardiner-Gibson, Jon Cink, Heba Muraisi, Teuta Hoxha and Kamran Ahmed say they have all been refusing food since early November. Ms Zuhrah and Ms Gardiner-Gibson have been refusing to eat for 38 days as of Wednesday, according to supporters. Each of the others are said to have been refusing to eat for at least 30 days.Two further detainees awaiting trial in Palestine Action-related cases began refusing food in the last fortnight.\"Each of our clients' health is deteriorating rapidly,\" says the letter.\"Five of our clients have already been hospitalised during their strike.\"The protest began over a series of demands including a call for the ban on Palestine Action to be lifted and for a defence firm with links to Israel to be shut down.Three High Court judges are expected to rule within weeks on the lawfulness of the ban. That review is a result of the courts granting the group's co-founder permission to challenge the home secretary's decision.The protesters say they have been denied bail, which they want, or a fair trial - although they have faced the same legal process as other defendants in Crown Court trials - hearings that have been independently witnessed by journalists.In the letter to Lammy, the group's lawyers say they are considering legal action over human rights breaches.\"We, as their legal team, are under no illusion that their commitment to their cause, and their will to ensure that their demands are met, is iron-clad,\" the letter says.\"We are concerned that, should this situation be allowed to continue without resolution, there is the real and increasingly likely potential that young British citizens will die in prison, having never even been convicted of an offence.\"We therefore request an urgent meeting with you, in an attempt to resolve this situation, before it becomes too late to avoid the death of one or more of our clients.\"Getty ImagesThe protests are taking place in five different prisonsSupporters of the detainees say they have formally complained about their treatment in prison. The BBC cannot independently corroborate that claim. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, an independent body, does not comment on individual complaints it receives or investigates.The Ministry of Justice has not commented on the letter - but earlier in Parliament the speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that it was \"unacceptable\" that ministers had not responded to requests for information from MPs.McDonnell told the House he had written to Lammy last Wednesday and not heard back.\"We've not received any response,\" he said. \"I informed his office yesterday I'd be raising a point of order. We gave it another day. We still haven't had a response to that letter. This is a matter of urgency.\"Corbyn added that he had visited one of the hunger strikers and was \"deeply concerned\".Sir Lindsay told McDonnell that it was \"totally unacceptable\" that ministers had not responded to him.\"I can't make a meeting happen, but I do expect people's correspondence to be dealt with quickly and effectively.\"Responding earlier in the week to inquiries about the hunger strike, a spokesman for the Prison Service said: \"We continually assess prisoners' well-being and take the appropriate action, including taking prisoners to hospital if they are assessed as needing hospital treatment by a medical professional.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoMark Savage,Music correspondentandIan Youngs,Culture reporterGetty ImagesThe pop band VÆB represented Iceland at the 2025 Eurovision Song ContestIceland has joined Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands in saying it will boycott the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest.All five countries have withdrawn after Israel's participation in the competition was officially confirmed last week.Stefan Eiriksson, director-general of Icelandic national broadcaster RÚV, said: \"There is no peace or joy connected to this contest as things stand now. On that basis, first and foremost, we are stepping back while the situation is as it is.\"RÚV said Israel's participation had \"created disunity among both members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the general public\".The broadcaster's board agreed the decision at a meeting on Wednesday, hours before the deadline for countries to confirm whether they will join what's supposed to be a celebratory 70th anniversary edition of the song contest next May.Iceland was believed to be the last remaining country to announce its decision.Eurovision director Martin Green said: \"We respect the decision of all broadcasters who have chosen not to participate in next year's Eurovision Song Contest and hope to welcome them back soon.\"ReutersThe next contest is due to be held in Vienna in May 2026 after Austrian singer JJ triumphed at this year's eventIsrael's presence at Eurovision has been an increasing source of tension, because of the war in Gaza and concerns about the voting and campaigning processes, including accusations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote at this year's event.A new raft of measures designed to protect the integrity of the vote was approved at an EBU summit last week, after which most countries confirmed they would travel to Vienna for the 2026 contest.The Icelandic broadcaster's board had previously approved a recommendation to ask the EBU to ban Israel from Eurovision 2026.Iceland was reportedly among seven countries that then requsted a vote at the EBU general meeting on Israel's participation.That request was denied, and Israel's future participation was instead effectively tied to a ballot on the new voting and campaigning rules.The Icelandic broadcaster said that while the new measures addressed many of its concerns, it \"believes that there are still doubts whether the agreed adjustments would be fully satisfactory\".\"RÚV has repeadly raised concerns that various Icelandic stakeholders, such as artist associations and the general public, were opposed to participation in the contest.\"Furthermore, RÚV had requested the EBU to exclude [Israeli public broadcaster] KAN from the contest in accordance to precedents.\"It is a complex matter which has already damaged the contest's reputation and EBU, emphasizing the necessity of a solution for all concerned parties.\"EPAIsrael's Yuval Raphael topped the public vote at Eurovision 2025 and finished second overall after jury scores were includedAccording to a transcript of Thursday's meeting supplied by KAN, the broadcaster's chief executive Golan Yochpaz criticised those trying to get Israel thrown out.\"The attempt to remove KAN from the contest can only be understood as a cultural boycott,\" he said. \"A boycott may begin today with Israel, but no one knows where it will end or who else it may harm.\"Is this what we truly want this contest to be remembered for on its 70th anniversary?\"Israel has taken part in Eurovision since 1973 because KAN, its public broadcaster, is a member of the EBU, which organises the competition.Israel has won four times, most recently in 2018, and came second in the 2025 contest.Iceland has never won but came second in 1999 and 2009.Poland 'giving Eurovision a chance'Meanwhile, Poland confirmed on Wednesday that it will take part in next year's contest.\"We are aware of the scale of tensions surrounding the upcoming edition. We understand the emotions and concerns,\" broadcaster TVP said.\"However, we believe that Eurovision still has a chance to once again become a space filled with music - and only music.\"We are giving it that chance, just as the vast majority of EBU members are.\"",

    "body": "48 minutes agoJames FitzGeraldPA MediaKimberlee Singler was detained in London two years agoA Colorado mother who is accused of murdering two of her children has been extradited from the UK to the US, authorities say.Kimberlee Singler, 37, is alleged to have carried out the attack in Colorado before fleeing to London, where she was arrested in December 2023.She challenged her extradition at Westminster Magistrates Court - reportedly on the basis that her sentence, if she was convicted, would break European human rights law. But she was unsuccessful.A district attorney in Colorado confirmed on Tuesday that Ms Singler was back in the US and was in custody. She was being held without bond and was expected to appear in court \"in the coming days\".The district attorney, Michael Allen, said Ms Singler was facing charges of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted murder, three counts of child abuse and one count of assault.At the extradition hearing in London, the court heard that Ms Singler's alleged crimes were \"committed against the backdrop of acrimonious court proceedings\" relating to the custody of her children with her ex-husband.Prosecutor Joel Smith said police in Colorado Springs responded to a 911 call reporting a burglary at a Colorado residence at 00:29 local time (06:29 GMT) on 19 December 2023.When officers arrived at the defendant's address, they found her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son dead and a \"blood-stained handgun\", which was discovered on the floor of the bedroom.Mr Smith said DNA tests were carried out on the gun and a knife which revealed the presence of mixed profiles matching the children and Ms Singler.A third child, who has not been named, was found with a serious injury to her neck. She was taken to hospital and survived.Mr Smith said Ms Singler blamed her husband for the attack, but it was found he had been driving a \"GPS-tracked truck\" in Denver, giving what the prosecutor described as a \"complete and verifiable alibi\".Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Adrian Vasquez, the Colorado Springs police chief, said the extradition of Ms Singler was \"a significant milestone\" in the investigation.Chief Vasquez added: \"I know these acts have deeply impacted this community, and our hearts remain with the victims.\"",

    "body": "Three people - including two police officers - have been killed in an explosion in Moscow, Russian authorities have said. Two traffic police officers saw a \"suspicious individual\" near a police car on the city's Yeletskaya Street, and when they approached the suspect to detain him, an explosive device was detonated, Russia's Investigative Committee has said. The two police officers died from their injuries, along with another individual who was standing nearby. The blast took place close to the location where a senior Russian general was killed in a car bombing in the capital on Monday.Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died after an explosive device - which had been planted under a car - was detonated.Investigate Committee spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement on Telegram that a criminal case was being investigated in Moscow \"regarding an attempt on the lives of traffic police officers\". The officers have been named by Russian media as Ilya Klimanov, 24, and Maxim Gorbunov, 25. Speaking to the Reuters news agency, Alexander, a resident who lives close by, said: \"There was an explosion.\"It was loud bang - like with the car a few days ago.\"Russia said it suspected Ukraine was behind Monday's explosion, however Ukraine has not said whether it was involved in Fanil Sarvarov's death.It is also not known whether the two explosions are linked. Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department.He was the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.",

In 1925 AA Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield.Winnie-the-Pooh, featuring the imaginary adventures of Milne's son Christoper Robin and his toy bear, was published in 1926 and its sequel The House at Pooh Corner in 1928. There were also two books of poems featuring the much-loved characters.The original bridge where Milne and his son Christopher Robin created the game Pooh sticks became worn and unsafe in the late 1990s.It was dismantled and replaced with a replica which is still in place in Ashdown Forest.The original structure sold at auction in 2021 for £131,000.Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyAA Milne with his son Christopher Robin and the well-loved bear in 1926 The honey-loving bear took on a new level of fame when Disney acquired the rights to the stories in 1961.Pooh Corner has been a gift shop and tea room close to Pooh Sticks Bridge in Hartfield since 1978 and is filled with mementos.Owner Neil Reed said: \"It's amazing to have people travel to our little village hidden in the English countryside from all over the world to celebrate Winnie-the-Pooh.Pooh CornerPooh Corner has acquired a rare copy of the 1925 Evening News story which features illustrations by J. H. Dowd\"We love hearing from visitors about why he is special to them and the reasons behind them travelling so far to come to the Ashdown Forest.\"Pooh Trek Tours has organised guided walks around the forest since 2018, taking in the sites made famous by the books.Founder Gerry Manser said around 90% of people on his tours came from outside the UK, predominantly from north America. PA MediaChristopher Milne revisited the original Pooh Sticks Bridge in 1979He said: \"The 100th anniversary is an extremely important event for the forest. \"Without Pooh one of the most remarkable landscapes in the UK wouldn't be as well-known.\"The commemorations in Ashdown Forest to mark Pooh's 100th birthday are expected to include an installation, which would transform the forest's visitor centre into a life-sized pop-up book.There are also plans to create new walking trails within the forest, designed to avoid protected sites.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "15 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesJessica Gunning won a Bafta for her role in Baby Reindeer in May Baby Reindeer was one of the standout television moments of the past few years and it catapulted actress Jessica Gunning to stardom. She played the obsessive and troubled woman, Martha, who dramatically unravels onscreen. For Gunning it was the \"role of a lifetime\", describing life as a \"surreal\" but also a \"dream\" since the show's release. \"I got goose bumps when I first read the script,\" the British actress tells the BBC, adding she had five auditions for the role.But she thought the television series might have been an indie hit, not the phenomenon on Netflix it became.  Of course, a potential downside of starring in a show like that does mean you get stopped in the street and occasionally confused with your character. \"I'd just parked near where I live and a woman screamed in my face! But in her defence she had just finished the series, walked out of her home and there I was. \"So that's surreal, occasionally being screamed at,\" she says.\"But everyone has been so lovely, there's also an incredible statistic about the difference the show has made to charities, especially ones for male survivors of sexual assault. \"I think it shows people want complicated stories. I have had 14-year-olds come and talk to me about it, as well as 90-year-olds.\"Getty ImagesShe played the troubled character MarthaAnyone who has watched Baby Reindeer may tell you it can be a difficult and upsetting watch.The show says it was based on real-life events experienced by the show's creator, Richard Gadd, who also plays the lead character. But this is disputed by the woman who allegedly inspired the person Martha is based on, who has said Netflix told \"brutal lies\" about her to more than 50 million viewers around the world.She said in June 2024 she was suing Netflix for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.The show is billed as \"a true story\", but a judge concluded in his ruling in September 2024 that certain key events in the series, like the conviction for stalking, did not happen in real life.Netflix failed in its attempt to persuade the judge to throw out the legal case brought against it, but said: \"We intend to defend this matter vigorously and to stand by Richard Gadd's right to tell his story.\"'It's all been a bit pinch me'Filming such an intense drama has given Gadd and Gunning a \"unique bond\" the actress says.\"We always checked in with each other and the producers and director made sure everything felt safe and considered.\"Baby Reindeer started life as a stage show at the Fringe at Edinburgh, Gunning had tried to see but couldn't get tickets so bought the play text instead.\"That was a little bit Martha of me\" she laughs.Her persistence paid off, and Gunning swept up during award season, winning an Emmy, a Bafta, a Golden Globe, an RTS and a Screen Actors Guild award. \"It's all been a bit pinch me, for all of the cast and crew really, we were out in LA, which is just crazy anyway to be in Hollywood. All the clichés are true, even to be nominated is an honour.\"Sometimes I look at the shelf that has my awards on and I think 'Oh my gosh', it feels like a dream really.\"Gunning has been in the industry for almost two decades, but Baby Reindeer has been a life-changing experience.\"I feel like on the one hand my life has completely changed, but I also feel exactly the same in a good way.\"\"I feel like if something like Baby Reindeer happened straight after coming out of drama school, maybe I'd feel like a bit of a deer in the headlights, pardon the pun. \"Now I feel a lot more grounded and I've got a big group of family and friends. But it is kind of strange, the number of viewers that Netflix bring in, you can't really compute. If you think about it too much it can feel a little bit scary.\"She is well aware of the significance of the role saying: \"I waited 17 years for a part like Martha to come along, so hopefully it won't be another 17 years.\"Getty ImagesJessica Gunning and her Baby Reindeer co-star Richard GaddGunning will next be on-screen on Christmas Eve, in the BBC One and Children In Need animation Pudsey and the Thread of Hope. It is based on an original story by McFly star and composer for the Paddington muscial Tom Fletcher, who's also written the music for the cartoon. Gunning plays a woman grieving for her husband, while her son is also navigating his way through grief. It is a handbrake turn after Baby Reindeer, but Gunning says the script was \"beautiful\" and she wanted to be involved \"in the special charity\". \"Children can deal with big issues like this, and hopefully children will watch and feel seen if they've experienced this, or are going through something similar.\" \"All my life I've grown up with Children In Need, I went to school dressed up as an Emu and wore it all day.\" Jessica Gunning took Pudsey Bear into a recording studioSo what next for Gunning? She's starring alongside Claire Foy and Andrew Garfield in a film adaptation of Enid Blyton's much-loved children's book, The Magic Faraway Tree, and is filming a comedy with Angelina Jolie. The actress who's from the West Yorkshire market town where enduring BBC sitcom Last of the Summer Wine was filmed jokes: \"It's Holmfirth to Hollywood.\" Pudsey and the Thread of Hope airs on 24 December at 10:20 GMT on BBC One and iPlayer, and on 27 December at 17:00 GMT on CBeebies and CBBC.",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaarea Masud & Simon BrowningBBC NewsGetty ImagesThe number of passengers passing through UK airports will be the most ever seen on any Christmas Eve since records began in 1972, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said.It projects over 335,000 people will be flying in the UK on Wednesday, which is up 5% from Christmas Eve in 2024, though minimal disruption is expected.Britain's roads are also expected to see one of the busiest Christmas Eves since records began said the RAC, though another motoring lobby says traffic peaks for the season have passed.The RAC said the worst time to travel on Wednesday is from 1pm to 7pm as millions hit the road to get home before Christmas Day on Thursday, with delays expected on major routes.Manchester airport said on Christmas Eve it expects around 75,000 passengers passing through, with 208 flights leaving the UK, but that number will halve on Christmas Day. Its most popular destinations on Christmas Eve are Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin.Heathrow meanwhile says it is expecting its busiest December period ever, including 152,000 passengers using it on Christmas Day. EasyJet said 558 flights will depart on Christmas Day, part of \"its busiest festive season ever\".Stansted Airport said Christmas Day for it, meanwhile, will be relatively quiet.The busiest single day of the festive period for air travel was Friday 19 December.Getty ImagesThe RAC meanwhile said particular tight spots on the roads will be the clockwise northern and western sections of the M25 from mid-morning, and the M5 north from Gloucestershire towards the West Midlands later in the afternoon.While millions will travel by rail, earlier last-train times mean many may take to the road, making them even more congested. Several rail routes will be restricted or closed over the Christmas period for maintenance.National Rail trains do not run on Christmas Day and only a small number will run on Boxing Day.National Express coaches says it is running on Christmas day to 96 destinations.The RAC's mobile servicing and repair's team leader Nick Mullender said 2025 was \"looking to be the busiest getaway period since our records began\" in 2013.He said this year's Christmas Eve would be the busiest, with workers saving on annual leave days and  heading off on getaways at the last minute.Meanwhile the AA, which provides traffic updates across the UK, said 19 December was the busiest part of the season.For Christmas Eve, it warned the M27 will close in both directions between Junction 9 (Whiteley/Park Gate) and Junction 11 (Fareham East/Gosport) from 8pm until 4am on 4 January for major works at Junction 10.This closure affects road journeys between Southampton and Portsmouth.Drivers are advised to check tyres, expect delays and ensure oil and coolant levels are correct. It expected a rise in breakdowns as the weather becomes colder and 4.2 million journeys will be taken on roads.You can see how weather will affect your Christmas travel plans on the road.You can see here how other transport, such as ferries, are affected.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentThe government's partial U-turn on what opponents dubbed the \"farms tax\" was a Christmas present for those who had campaigned against the imposition of 20% inheritance tax from next April.About half the farms that would have been affected will now be exempt.But given that minsters had defended the policy in the 14 months since last year's Budget, the questions are: Why change it? And why now?Sustained protests - the regular convoys of tractors, horns blaring, converging on Parliament Square - certainly played a part. The National Farmers' Union which had organised the noisy demonstrations had also engaged in quieter diplomacy behind the scenes with Downing Street and the agriculture department. It has been reported that discussions shifted to mitigating rather than obliterating the policy completely. But there are other factors.A consequence of last year's landslide Labour election victory is that more of the party's MPs represent rural and semi-rural seats. Behind closed doors, some of them had been pressing hard for concessions. While only one voted against, more than 30 of them actively abstained on a parliamentary vote on the inheritance tax policy earlier this month to demonstrate their concerns.Beyond this, the reasons for the timing of the government's volte face are speculative.One of the rural rebels told me that conversations with ministers had been more positive this month - though they had not been told in advance of yesterday's announcement.And some believe that Sir Keir Starmer's appearance this month before the liaison committee - which consists of senior MPs who chair cross-party parliamentary committees - played a role.He was subjected to uncomfortable questioning by the Labour MP Cat Smith and the Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael, both of whom in effect suggested some farmers were contemplating suicide - or as Smith put it, \"actively planning to expedite their own deaths\" - before inheritance tax was introduced next April so they could pass on their family farms.The prospect of personal tragedies - and awful headlines - was made very clear to the prime minister.Downing Street is keen to get on the front foot when MPs return to Parliament in January, and dispelling this particular political dark cloud might have been regarded as an essential precursor.The Conservatives maintain that the policy change was \"sneaked out\" while MPs were away and could not subject ministers to scrutiny.A recess reversal certainly does not radiate confidence from a government that has 400 of parliament's 650 seats.While some Labour MPs are relieved that the government has listened, others are wondering why it persisted with a policy that was going to raise relatively little revenue. This change is going to cost £130m. To put that in context, it is a tiny fraction of the around £900bn generated in total in taxation annually.And of course with Labour trailing in the polls, there are concerns about the government's ability to make the political weather.Something of a modus operandi is emerging where revenue raising policies are announced by the Treasury, then there is a public backlash, and internal Labour discontent followed some time later by a partial reversal once the political damage has been sustained.Think winter fuel, welfare reform and now family farms.The policies may have changed but questions over political judgment remain.",

    "body": "16 hours agoLana LamSydneyAustralian Federal PolicePolice arrested and charged the British man, 43, earlier this monthA British national in Australia has had his visa cancelled and faces deportation for allegedly displaying Nazi symbols.The 43-year-old man living in Queensland was arrested and charged earlier this month, after allegedly using a social media account to post the Nazi swastika, promote pro-Nazi ideology and call for violence towards the Jewish community.The man was taken into immigration detention this week in Brisbane and is due to face court in January. Police have been cracking down on the use of prohibited symbols amid a recent rise in antisemitism and right-wing extremism.Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said: \"He came here to hate - he doesn't get to stay.\"\"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest,\" Burke told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) on Wednesday.Last month, Burke also revoked the visa of Matthew Gruter, a South African national who had been living in Australia since 2022, after he was seen attending a neo-Nazi rally in front of the New South Wales parliament. Like Gruter, the British man can appeal his visa being revoked. He can leave Australia voluntarily or wait to be deported to his home country. It is understood police are assessing whether to delay deporting the man so he can face court next month.The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment.Earlier this year, Australia tightened its hate crime laws, introducing mandatory jail terms for displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute.Police began investigating the British man in October over alleged posts on X. The social media platform blocked his account, prompting him to create a new one with a similar name where he continued posting offensive and harmful content, police said. Australian Federal PolicePolice seized weapons including axes and knives from the British man's homeAuthorities searched the man's home in Caboolture, on the outskirts of Brisbane, in late November and seized phones, weapons and several swords with swastika symbols. He was charged with three counts of displaying banned Nazi symbols and one count  of using the internet to cause offense.\"We want to ensure these symbols are not being used to fracture social cohesion,\" Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Nutt said earlier this month.  \"If we identify instances where this is happening, we will act swiftly to disrupt the behaviour, prosecute those involved and protect the dignity, safety and cohesion of our diverse community.\"",

    "body": "58 minutes agoNick TriggleHealth correspondentGetty ImagesThe amount of flu circulating has started to fall in England, latest data suggests.The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it was encouraging news heading into Christmas, but warned the virus could always bounce back in the new year.The UKHSA uses a range of different measures to monitor flu rates, including sample testing in hospitals and in GP practices.The latest data covers last week up to Sunday with the UKHSA concluding the virus was circulating \"at medium levels\".Similar trends are being seen elsewhere in the UK. Public Health Scotland said it had seen two weeks of cases decreasing.The fall in England comes after the agency said last week that the spread was stabilising after several weeks of rises.This year's flu season started early, driven by a mutated strain of the virus, which prompted concern about the pressure that could be placed on hospitals.NHS England data for the total number of people in hospital is not being published this week.But there are signs in UKHSA's sample testing that the numbers being admitted to hospital are beginning to fall, suggesting the projections of record numbers of patients ending up in hospital with the virus over the festive period will not be realised.Dr Jamie Lopez-Bernal, an infectious diseases expert at UKHSA, said it was \"encouraging news\".But he added: \"The virus is still very much with us and everyone, especially those most vulnerable to winter bugs, needs to take care to protect themselves or help not to spread these viruses to others.\"This is particularly important over Christmas as families come together to celebrate. So if you have any cold or flu-like symptoms you should try to minimise contact with others.\"He said there were simple steps we can all take to protect one another when mixing indoors.\"Washing hands regularly and ensuring indoor spaces are well ventilated helps, and we advise those who have symptoms and need to go out, to consider wearing a face covering in indoor public spaces. These simple measures can help make a difference to reduce the spread.\"Flu is always unpredictable, is still circulating and could bounce back even further in the new year as we have seen in past years,\" he warned.

Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"Ahmed has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American.\"Also targeted was Thierry Breton, the former top tech regulator at the European Commission, who suggested that a \"witch hunt\" was taking place.Breton was described by the State Department as the \"mastermind\" of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation on social media firms. However, it has angered some US conservatives who see it as seeking to censor right-wing opinions. Brussels denies this.Breton has clashed with Elon Musk, the world's richest man and owner of X, over obligations to follow EU rules.The European Commission recently fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges - the first fine under the DSA. It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"European leaders have condemned the move, with Macron saying: \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty.\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"The European Commission said it had \"requested clarifications\" from the US, and would \"respond swiftly and decisively to defend our regulatory autonomy against unjustified measures\".Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "8 hours agoSean CoughlanRoyal correspondentEvery time you think the Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor story must have finished, there is another twist.The latest batch of documents from the Epstein files includes emails that could further damage his reputation. Or perhaps his reputation is already at rock bottom and this will only reinforce existing negative impressions.Public opinion might be divided too, in reaction to this drip-drip of pictures and emails.There might be some who have had enough of all these seedy headlines and do not want any more Andrew all over their Christmas dinner. They have already formed an opinion and this will only provide further confirmation.While others will see these latest documents as evidence of the need to press even harder into Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein and his circle. What more is there to find, they will ask.There are still outstanding calls for Andrew to give evidence to a US Congress committee and the US Department of Justice. And these latest emails will only add to the questions.\"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" someone called A in Balmoral asks Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's friend and companion who is now  serving a 20-year prison sentence in the US for sex trafficking.Maxwell replies: \"I have only been able to find appropriate friends. Will let you know about some church meetings on those dates.\"She signs off with \"kisses\", and the emails seem to be between people who are very close.The identity of A, who also uses the name \"Invisible Man\", is not made clear and we do not know for sure it is Andrew. And there might be some quizzical looks at some of the language in the emails - for instance \"Fall\" rather than \"Autumn\", which is more like American English than British.But there are lines in the emails that seem to tally with Andrew's biography, such as talking about when he left the Royal Navy.Elsewhere in the files, there also seem to be documents detailing arrangements in 2002 for a trip to Peru, with calls from Maxwell for discreet introductions to friends when he is there, with the suggestion from Maxwell of \"intelligent pretty fun and from good families\".All of that could be read in many different ways, innocent or otherwise. And appearing in these files is not any proof of guilt or misbehaviour.But part of the challenge with this released information is to put apparently random pieces into some kind of context.The email sent by \"A\" asking for \"inappropriate friends\" was sent in August 2001, which is five months after Virginia Giuffre claims she was forced to have sex with the then Prince Andrew in London at Maxwell's house.That is a claim that Andrew has always strongly denied and he has always rejected any claims of wrongdoing arising from his links with Epstein.However, further documents show that the US Department of Justice formally sought to question Andrew, asking in April 2020 for the UK government to assist in getting him to give evidence in cases linked to Epstein.In the event that he would not voluntarily give evidence, the US authorities asked their UK counterparts to compel him.There were also detailed questions about Andrew's relationship with Epstein from US authorities, including asking for details for any financial payments between them or any women associated with Maxwell or Epstein.There could be more questions about what happened to that request. It arrived when the Covid lockdown had just begun and attention was elsewhere.There has already been some embarrassment for Andrew from the Epstein files, with a picture of him lying on the laps of people in what is thought to be the saloon at Sandringham, with Maxwell in the background.It is a room in Sandringham where the royals could be gathering this week to watch the King's message and they might have to erase that other image from their thoughts.So far for Andrew it is more bad news, but perhaps similar to the previous bad news, of which there has been plenty.A year ago there were multiple \"What next for Andrew?\" pieces, after his disastrous scandal surrounding his links to an alleged Chinese spy.And it could not have been foreseen then how much further there was still to fall, with Andrew experiencing the most public loss of status for a royal in modern history.No-one would have predicted the loss of his titles and his status as prince.Next year there will be questions about his finances and his Crown Estate lease from the Public Accounts Committee.And who knows how much more could emerge from this vast cache of Epstein documents?This is a downward spiral - and every time you think it has ended, has kept going deeper.",

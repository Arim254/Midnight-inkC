    "body": "GCHQ Christmas card sets annual code-cracking challenge4 hours agoAnna LamcheGCHQFans of codebreaking, maths and brainteasers can now try their hand at the latest cryptic Christmas challenge set by GCHQ, the UK's intelligence agency.GCHQ released its annual Christmas card on Wednesday, filled with puzzles and hidden codes designed to help children aged 11-18 hone a range of skills \"they might need to become a spy\".The card was created by \"schoolchildren as well as spies\", according to GCHQ, after hundreds of young people entered a design competition in the lead-up to the festive period.It contains seven puzzles set by \"GCHQ's in-house puzzlers\", geared towards testing a range of problem-solving skills including intuitive reasoning and lateral thinking.Students were asked to draw their response to the question: \"What do you think GCHQ looks like on Christmas Day?\". They were challenged to embed hidden codes and ciphers into their designs.Three winners were selected by a panel of judges across three age groups.The famously tricky puzzles \"aren't meant to be solved alone\", GCHQ said, adding: \"We believe the right mix of minds means we can solve seemingly impossible problems.\"\"Puzzles are at the heart of GCHQ's work to keep the country safe from hostile states, terrorists and criminals; challenging our teams to think creatively and analytically every day,\" said GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler.She said she hoped the puzzle encourages the next generation \"to explore STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects and consider the rewarding careers available in cybersecurity and intelligence\".Meanwhile, the spy agency's \"Chief Puzzler\", known only as \"Colin\", said the puzzles are designed to test \"the same blend of skills our teams use every day to keep the country safe.\"Answers were released on Wednesday evening - so you can see below whether you've got the puzzles correct.More on this story",

    "body": "Italian cooking has been awarded special cultural heritage status by the United Nations' cultural agency Unesco. National favourites including pizza are already on Unesco's list of \"intangible cultural heritage\", but now Italian cooking traditions and the way they are practiced and transmitted have been awarded. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has been pushing for her country's cuisine to be recognised since her election, said: \"For us Italians, cuisine is not just food or a collection of recipes. It is so much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth.\" For millions of fans the news confirms what they already believed - from Sicilian Cannoli to Calabrian 'Nduja - Italian is the best. The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. \"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage.

    "body": "3 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterOlympic medal-winning swimmer and campaigner Sharron Davies has been named as one of three new Conservative peers.Ms Davies, a vocal critic of trans women in women's sport, was nominated by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch.The Tories said it was in recognition of her sporting achievements and her campaigning on women's rights. Iceland supermarket chairman Richard Walker and former Number 10 communications director Matthew Doyle are among 25 new Labour peers nominated by Sir Keir Starmer. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey nominated five new peers.Ms Davies will sit alongside ex-Tory cabinet minister John Redwood and journalist and historian Simon Heffer - who have also been handed peerages.She has become an outspoken campaigner against allowing transgender athletes in female competitions in order to \"protect women's sport\".The swimmer, who won a silver medal at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and two Commonwealth golds, denied that her comments were transphobic and claimed she had spoken to many other female athletes who \"feel the same way as me\".Following her nomination, Ms Davies said it would be \"exciting to carry on fighting for women's rights and safeguarding as well as trying to get as many kids, in particular, doing sport as possible\".Meanwhile, a Labour spokesperson said their new 25 peers would allow the government to \"deliver on our mandate from the British people\" and \"correct\" the imbalance against  Labour in the House of Lords, where the Tories currently have more representation.Despite having a majority in the House of Commons, Labour is currently outnumbered in the Lords, with 209 peers to the Tories' 282.Mr Walker's nomination confirms reports earlier in the week from Labour sources calling him \"a committed champion of families dealing with the cost of living\".The 45-year-old left the Conservative Party in 2023, and was later seen at the launch of Labour's manifesto for the 2024 general election.In February this year, he gave the new government a score of \"six out of 10\" in comments to the Financial Times, taking issue with it raising employer national insurance contributions but praising its attempts to improve relations with the EU.A Labour spokesperson said: \"⁠The Tories stuffed the House of Lords, creating a serious imbalance that has allowed them to frustrate our plans to make working families better off.\"We will continue to progress our programme of reform, which includes removing the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the Lords.\"Labour is in the process of abolishing 92 seats reserved for hereditary peers - who inherit their titles through their families.Sir Keir Starmer has previously come out in favour of abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with an elected Assembly of the Nations and Regions, but has not put forward deeper reforms before the next election.Labour’s election manifesto called House of Lords reform \"long overdue\" and \"essential\" as the chamber is too large and many peers fail to serve democracy.Among the new Labour peers are Mr Doyle, a veteran of the Tony Blair government who resigned in March after nine months leading Downing Street's press operation. Rachel Reeves's ex-chief of staff Katie Martin, was also given a peerage.Labour nominated several senior London-based political figures including Len Duvall, chair of the London Assembly, Mayor of Lewisham Brenda Dacres and ex-leader of Southwark Council Peter John.The Lib Dems nominated Lord Addington and Earl Russell, both hereditary peers, letting them stay in the House of Lords after those seats are abolished.The Earl of Kinnoull, one of the deputy speakers of the House of Lords, has also been awarded a peerage to remain as an independent crossbencher.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said his party had appointed members who will work to \"deliver the change our country desperately needs, including reform of the House of Lords\".They include ex-Lib Dem MP Sarah Teather, who served as children's minister between 2010 and 2012, and Rhiannon Leaman who has been Sir Ed's chief of staff since 2019.No other party received new peers.Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said he had written to the prime minister in the summer requesting that his party, which has five MPs and one Lord but regularly leads national voting intention polls, \"have some representation in the House of Lords\".Most Lords are entitled to a £371 daily allowance for each sitting day they attend - although they can choose not to claim it. Like MPs, they scrutinise the work of government and recommend changes to proposed legislation. Unlike MPs, however, peers are not elected.",

    "body": "5 hours agoMaia Davies & Anna LamcheA member of the UK armed forces who died in Ukraine has been named as Lance Corporal George Hooley of the Parachute Regiment.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer paid tribute to the 28-year-old paratrooper, saying he had lived a life \"full of courage and determination\".\"He served our country with honour and distinction around the world in the cause of freedom and democracy, including as part of the small number of British personnel in Ukraine.\"The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said he had been killed in a \"tragic accident\" while observing Ukrainian forces test \"a new defensive capability, away from the front lines\" on Tuesday.Speaking in the House of Commons, Sir Keir said he had placed L/Cpl Hooley's name on record \"to express our gratitude and respect, and to affirm that his service will never be forgotten\".L/Cpl Hooley had an \"incredibly bright\" future, his commanding officer said in a tribute on Wednesday.\"I have no doubt that he would have continued to perform at the very front of his peer group over the coming years,\" the commanding officer said, adding that \"all members of the Parachute Regiment mourn his loss\".The 28-year-old's company commander added: \"If you met George Hooley, you remembered it. His energy and enthusiasm were simply extraordinary.\"He provided spark that lifted others, a drive that inspired, and a zest for life that reminded us all how to live with purpose and joy. And we loved him for it. George had a rare gift: a deep kindness and genuine time for everyone.\"He was \"the model of professionalism\" and a \"born soldier\", the company commander added.\"His colleagues will tell you that he wasn't just part of the team, he was the character within it. The glue. The laughter. The calm voice of sense. The soldier who made the hard days easy and the good days memorable.\"The paratrooper was due to be promoted to Corporal in January and had been given the role's responsibilities on his deployment to Ukraine, the MoD said.He had previously been deployed to Afghanistan, Africa and Eastern Europe.Defence Secretary John Healey shared his condolences with L/Cpl Hooley's family and colleagues. He said: \"He served our country with distinction. His tragic death reminds us of the courage and commitment with which our outstanding armed forces serve every day.\"The BBC understands the incident is not thought to have been caused by hostile fire. A military source told the BBC two Ukrainian personnel were believed to have died in the incident, and several more were injured.The weapons system being tested was said to be an armed interceptor drone, according to unconfirmed reports.Ukraine's Ministry of Defence has been approached for comment.It is not known what L/Cpl Hooley's role was in the country. This is the first time the presence of paratroopers in Ukraine has been confirmed.The UK government has never disclosed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number is there to support Ukrainian armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.The Parachute Regiment is an airborne infantry regiment of the British Army.It has not been confirmed in which battalion L/Cpl Hooley served. The first battalion is under the direction of special forces, while others are part of the Army's rapid response formation.It is the first death of a UK service member in Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in February 2022.The Parachute Regiment said it was mourning the death of the 28-year-old, who joined the British Army in November 2015.He joined the Regiment in June 2016 after completing his training at the Infantry Training Centre Catterick in North Yorkshire, it said in a statement on social media.A series of meetings to bring the war in Ukraine to an end have taken place in recent weeks, following interventions from US President Donald Trump and a range of European leaders.Sir Keir told the Commons he had met Ukraine's President Zelensky in Downing Street on Monday, alongside France's President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as efforts to negotiate an end to the war intensify.\"We must redouble our efforts,\" he told the House.\"The UK, Europe and our allies will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Ukraine, stand up to Putin's aggression and work to deliver a just and lasting peace.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, also speaking in the Commons, said: \"The thoughts of the whole House will rightly be with family of Lance Corporal Hooley, who tragically died supporting Ukraine in her fight for freedom.\"US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who welcomed Healey to Washington DC for defence talks on Wednesday, also paid tribute to L/Cpl Hooley, saying: \"It is a reflection of the sacrifice and commitment that so many make around the world.\"",

    "body": "Banks to tell you where you might put your money1 hour agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesPeople who might otherwise turn to friends, family, or social media influencers for financial advice are to be given new help to invest their money.Targeted support from registered banks and other financial firms is being given the go-ahead by the City regulator and should start in April.This will allow firms to make investment and pensions recommendations based on what similar groups of people could do with their money.It still falls short of individually tailored advice, which can only be provided by an authorised financial adviser for a fee.Nearly one in five people turned to family, friends or social media for help making financial decisions, according to a survey by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA, said the new regime would be \"game changing\". \"It means millions of people can get extra help to make better financial decisions,\" she said.\"We also hope it will build greater confidence to invest. While investing will not be right for everyone, we know people in the UK invest less compared to the EU or US.\"'Advice gap'Investing money is not an option for millions of people. The regulator said that one in 10 people had no cash savings, and another 21% had less than £1,000 to draw on in an emergency.However, FCA data suggested about seven million adults in the UK with £10,000 or more in cash savings could receive better returns through investing.Investing does come with some risk as the value of an investment can go down as well as up, but the spending power of cash savings can be eroded by rising prices.The regulator said that many consumers who were in a position to invest but chose not to did so because they were unsure of their options, felt overwhelmed,  or needed more support. Only 9% of people surveyed received regulated advice on their pensions and investments in the 12 months to May 2024.Targeted support aims to bridge a gap between general guidance and information, and financial advisers who charge a fee.For example, banks could explain how a large pot of cash savings could be invested, or how investments could be spread out to reduce risk. \"The FCA's new rules mark a significant step towards closing the advice gap and will empower millions,\" said Yvonne Braun, director of policy at the Association of British Insurers.Some consumer groups have made clear that the new rules must not be a pathway to firms exploiting customers.The FCA said firms taking part would need to be authorised in advance. They might include banks, building societies, investment platforms and digital wallet providers.They would also be required to show that their recommendations were suitable and should only be offered when it put people in a better position, the regulator said. Any customer vulnerabilities would need to be identified and taken into account.Consumers will have the right to take any disputes that arise to the independent financial ombudsman.There will also be a move to allow people to make more informed decisions with their pensions.The regulator's new rules will require legislation, but the government has made it a clear objective to encourage people to invest. The Treasury believes this will help to create economic growth.It was one of the reasons for the decision by Chancellor Rachel Reeves to cut the annual allowance for cash Isas (Individual Savings Accounts) from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for under 65s, from April 2027.Separately, the FCA has launched a \"firm checker\" tool to help prevent people from losing money to fraudsters through investment scams.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSimon Jack,Business editorandArchie MitchellWatch: GSK boss Dame Emma Walmsley lays out competitions facing the UKThe US is the best place for a business to invest, the boss of one of the UK's biggest pharmaceutical companies has said.Dame Emma Walmsley, chief executive of vaccines and medicines giant GSK, said it will invest $30bn (£23bn) in the US by 2030.It comes as other major drug makers have pulled UK projects worth billions after years of frustration on NHS drug budgets and pressure from President Donald Trump to set up production in the US.However Dame Emma, who will leave GSK in January after eight years in charge, welcomed a new deal which will see the NHS pay more to help secure zero tariffs on shipping UK pharmaceuticals to America.Speaking to the BBC from the firm's central London headquarters, Dame Emma said she would not \"shy away\" from GSK's investment plans for the US, where it makes more than half of its turnover.The US is \"still the leading market in the world in terms of the launches of new drugs and vaccines,\" she said. And alongside China, it was \"the best market in the world to do business development,\" she added.GSK's latest stateside investment drive followed US pharmaceutical company Merck - which is called MSD in Europe – scrapping a planned £1bn expansion of its UK operations.UK drug maker AstraZeneca has also announced it is pausing a planned £200m investment in a Cambridge research facility while ploughing tens of billions of dollars into the US.Other drug companies have also said there is little appetite to invest in the UK which successive governments have insisted is a life sciences superpower. Despite the challenges facing Britain's pharmaceuticals industry, Dame Emma said the deal to scrap tariffs on UK drug shipments to the US was \"a step in the right direction\" for Britain.The deal means the UK will pay more for medicines through the NHS - in return for a guarantee that US import taxes on pharmaceuticals made in the UK will remain at zero for three years.Dame Emma said it was a welcome reversal of a long term decline in the portion of the NHS budget spent on medicines compared to other countries' health systems. The move, she said, would encourage the kind of innovation that supports ground breaking new medicines like GSK's new asthma drug which can be taken twice a year and could slash hospital admissions by 70% for serious asthma sufferers.GSK hopes the new treatment will be approved for use by the NHS within weeks. Asked about the health of the country, she said there were \"social demographic root causes\" for its decline.She said UK health outcomes varied widely depending on where you live  \"you can probably get a 10 or 15-year difference in lifespan prospects depending on which postcode you're in.\"Dame Emma pointed to British diets and a lack of education around nutrition as part of the problem.  \"I think there's no question that the food system is fundamentally something we need to look at harder,\" she said.Dame Emma also opened up about the differences she has experienced between the NHS and the private healthcare system in the US, having given birth in London, Paris and twice in New York.\"Both the experience of childbirth and all the follow up that happens afterwards are very, very different,\" she said. \"Anything from the advice you're given...the frequency with which you are expected to be visited, how long you are in hospital and what kind of follow-up advice.\"Dame Emma said what matters is the balance of price, access and outcomes, and that the NHS still has \"work to do\" on getting the balance right.Dame Emma, who also sits on the board of Microsoft, said the world was on the cusp of major advances in health science thanks in part to advances in AI which promise to accelerate innovation \"90 % of the projects in our industry don't work, they take a decade and cost billions, getting to a place where you just double that to you know, instead of 10% working, 20% working will completely change the trajectory of innovation\"In the end, she said, few things are more important than health. \"It is one of the few things that every single person on the planet ends up caring about\".",

I feel really glad to have known her, really lucky to have had her in my life.\"How 'little treats' helped Sophie Kinsella through cancerKinsella's books have sold more than 50 million copies in more than 60 countries, and have been translated into more than 40 languages.Author Jodi Picoult said Kinsella \"will be missed greatly\", while fellow novelist Adele Parks described her as a \"wonderful, warm woman\" who \"brought so much joy to the world\".\"She'll be missed so much but celebrated too and will live on in millions of minds and hearts,\" Parks said.Writer Jenny Colgan told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive: \"When you do lose someone close it can be hard to communicate [who they were] but everybody who has ever read a Sophie Kinsella novel, that is what she was like. She was really funny, really warm.\"Sarah CresswellKinsella, pictured in 2024, had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancerKinsella announced in 2024 that she had been diagnosed with a glioblastoma two years earlier.In a statement on Wednesday, her family said they were \"heartbroken\" to announce the death of \"our beloved Sophie\".\"She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy.\"They continued: \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received. She will be missed so much our hearts are breaking.\"'Unique voice'A statement from Kinsella's publisher said she \"defined and elevated romantic comedy by populating her stories with real-life issues that combined wit, emotional depth and societal insight\".Bill Scott-Kerr, her longstanding publisher at Transworld, described Kinsella as \"our author, our cheerleader, our fellow conspirator and our friend\".He added: \"Maddy leaves behind a glorious and indelible legacy, a unique voice, an unquenchable spirit, a goodness of intent and a body of work that will continue to inspire us to reach higher and be better, just like so many of her characters.\"British romantic comedy writer Jill Mansell offered: \"Maddy was a brilliant writer but more importantly a truly lovely person.\"In both respects she brought so much joy to the world.\"Sarah CresswellThe author's agents Araminta Whitley and Marina de Pass described Kinsella as \"an intelligent, imaginative, loving and irreverent woman who valued the deeply connective power of fiction\".\"She had a rare gift for creating emotionally resonant protagonists and stories that spoke to, and entertained, readers wherever they were in the world and whatever challenges they faced.\"They added: \"She also had an unmatched wit and ability to find the funny side. \"Comedy, for her, was both an art form and an intellectual pursuit and she instinctively understood that it is often a tightrope act of balancing light with dark.\"Moyes agreed, telling the BBC: \"The big mistake people make with Sophie's books is they assume they were easy [to write] because they're easy to read.\"But anybody who's tried to replicate them knows that she was a master plotter, and a master at characterisation. She was a genius, actually.\"Getty ImagesKinsella wrote last year that she had \"always processed my life through writing\"Kinsella was born in London in 1969, and studied music at New College, Oxford, before switching to philosophy, politics and economics. She wrote her first novel, The Tennis Party, aged 24 under her married name Madeleine Wickham, while working as a financial journalist.\"My overriding concern was that I didn't write the autobiographical first novel,\" she told the Guardian in 2012. \"I was so, so determined not to write about a 24-year-old journalist. \"It was going to have male characters, and middle-aged people, so I could say, look, I'm not just writing about my life, I'm a real author.\"The book was acclaimed by critics and became a top 10 bestseller. She released six further novels as Madeleine Wickham.Five years later, writing as Sophie Kinsella, she published The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic - also known as Confessions of a Shopaholic.It introduced readers to Becky Bloomwood, a financial journalist who is a serial shopper and hopeless when it comes to her own finances, often buying new clothes or shoes on her credit card rather than saving her money.\"I thought, wait a minute, shopping has become the national pastime, and nobody has written about it,\" Kinsella said of her bestselling series.The first two novels in the series were adapted for the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic, starring Isla Fisher.Getty ImagesA film adaptation of Confessions of a Shopaholic starring Isla Fisher was released in 2009After its huge success, Kinsella went on to write eight further Shopaholic novels and a short story, and another 18 books in total, including one young adult novel and four children's books.Kinsella's other works include Can You Keep A Secret? and The Undomestic Goddess.Her books were occasionally referred to as \"chick lit\" - a description she did not fully endorse\"When I hear the term 'chick lit', I feel a pinprick of, not annoyance but of slight resignation,\" she told the Daily Mail in 2018. \"'Oh, this again…' \"I've never had anyone say to my face, 'Your books are inferior,' but if people say, 'Your books are beach reads,' I say, 'Yep, that's fine by me. Read them on the beach!'\"Kinsella's most recent novella, What Does It Feel Like?, published in October 2024, was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, written after she had surgery.In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing\".\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe.\"Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry and their five children.What is a glioblastoma?Glioblastomas are the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer.About 3,200 people are diagnosed with a glioblastoma every year in the UK. Of these, just 160 survive for five years or more.It's a type of cancer that grows quickly - glioblastomas are likely to spread within the brain and come back even after being removed.Symptoms vary, but can include headaches caused by a build-up of pressure, personality changes, and memory problems. People may also have trouble speaking or experience extreme tiredness, depression, seizures and sight problems.Common treatments include chemotherapy and radiotherapy, or if a patient is well enough, a surgeon will try to remove as much cancer as possible during an operation.",

    "body": "Fed lowers interest rates but future cuts uncertain4 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterReutersUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome PowellThe US Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates for the third time this year, even as internal divisions create uncertainty about additional cuts in the coming months.The central bank said on Wednesday it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years.But policymakers disagree about how the Fed should balance competing priorities: a weakening job market on the one hand, and rising prices on the other.The Fed's economic projections released on Wednesday suggest one rate cut will take place next year, although new data could change this.Fed chair Jerome Powell said central bankers need time to see how the Fed's three cuts this year work their way through the US economy. Policymakers will closely examine incoming data leading up to Fed's next meeting in January, he added.\"We are well-positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves,\" Powell told reporters.Those hoping for interest rates to keep coming down, including President Donald Trump, might have to wait.The Fed is facing a \"very challenging situation\" as it confronts risks of rising inflation and unemployment, Powell said, adding: \"you can't do two things at once\".The decision to lower rates on Wednesday was not unanimous, suggesting widening divisions among central bankers over the outlook for the US economy. Three Fed officials broke ranks and officially dissented.Stephen Miran, who is on leave from his post leading Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, voted for a larger 0.5 percentage point cut. Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted to hold rates steady.Trump, who has repeatedly urged Powell to lower rates, said after the meeting on Wednesday that the Fed's cut could have been \"at least doubled\".\"Our rates should be much lower,\" he said at a roundtable at the White House. \"We should have the lowest rates in the world.\"A data blackout during the longest-ever US government shutdown, which ended in November, has left policymakers partially in the dark about the state of the economy. But concerns about a slowing job market continue to outweigh inflation fears, at least for now.The unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4% in September, Labor Department figures showed in a delayed report released last month. Cutting interest rates is aimed at stimulating the job market by creating lower borrowing costs for businesses.Fears about tariff-driven inflation had taken centre stage earlier this year when Trump pushed forward with sweeping tariffs on many of the country's largest trading partners.Inflation is still above the Fed's 2% target. In September, it hit 3% for the first time since January.But while tariffs appear to be boosting some consumer prices, recent milder-than-expected inflation readings have allowed the Fed to focus on boosting the labour market by lowering rates, analysts said.Dissents and disagreementsStill, policymakers remain divided over the path forward for interest rates.Asked about disagreement among policymakers, Powell acknowledged that it's \"unusual\" to have \"persistent tension\" between the Fed's two mandates to keep prices stable and unemployment low.\"And when you do, this is what you see,\" he said, referring to growing divisions.Still, Powell characterised the internal debate between Fed officials as thoughtful and respectful.\"We come together and we reach a place where we can make a decision,\" he said.The central bank's so-called dot plot, a quarterly anonymous economic forecast, showed on Wednesday a median expectation for one additional 0.25 percentage point cut in 2026. That prediction was unchanged from the previous dot plot in September.Central bankers are poised to have a bit more clarity next week, with the expected release of official data on the labour market and inflation for November.The incoming data could shift policymakers' outlook, potentially bolstering calls for further easing next year if there are new signs that the job market is stalling.Who will succeed Powell?Trump's search for Powell's replacement as Fed chair, once his term ends next May, is adding to uncertainty about the path forward for Fed policy.Trump could announce his pick as soon as within the next few weeks.Kevin Hassett, a long-time conservative economist and key Trump economic adviser, is seen as the front-runner to succeed Powell.A Trump loyalist, Hassett served as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers during Trump's first term and now leads the National Economic Council. He has been a stalwart defender of Trump's economic policies, downplaying data showing signs of weakness in the US economy, doubling down on allegations of bias at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and backing Trump's handling of the Fed.Hassett's allegiance to the president has drawn questions from analysts about whether he would act independently and how much sway he would have with other members of the board.Other names that have been floated for the Fed chair include economist Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.Trump is \"still making up his mind, and he's looking for someone who will be in his way of thinking,\" Thomas Hoenig, a distinguished senior fellow at the Mercatus Center, told the BBC.The candidates, he added, \"have to project that they will be independent, or the markets will become quite nervous - and that will create more volatility\".Asked on Wednesday whether Trump's search for a new Fed chair is hindering his job or changing his thinking, Powell responded with a resounding \"no\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoJaroslav LukivandChris Mason,Political editorEuropean leaders have said \"intensive work\" will continue in the coming days on a US-led plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war, after a joint phone call with President Donald Trump.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said they \"agreed that this was a critical moment - for Ukraine, its people and for shared security across the Euro-Atlantic region\".Trump later said \"we discussed Ukraine in pretty strong words\", admitting that there were \"some little disputes about people\". The joint call comes the day after Trump called European leaders \"weak\", suggesting the US could scale back support for Ukraine. In the wide-ranging Politico interview published on Tuesday, Trump also claimed Ukraine was \"using war\" to avoid holding elections, prompting President Volodymyr Zelensky to reply he was \"ready\" for them.Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory.The three European leaders issued identical statements shortly after their call with Trump on Wednesday.They read: \"The leaders discussed the latest on the ongoing US-led peace talks, welcoming their efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace for Ukraine, and to see an end to the killing.\"Intensive work on the peace plan is continuing and will continue in the coming days.\"The call lasted for about 45 minutes, and was initiated by the Americans last night.Sources characterise progress as \"inching towards a deal\" - but emphasise the complexity of arriving at one.A key sticking point remains Ukrainian territory and whether it is viable or reasonable to expect Kyiv to effectively give up land regarded as its own.The longstanding formulation of the British government is that decisions about Ukraine have to be made by Ukraine.This is an argument European governments are making to Washington, while publicly and privately praising Trump's commitment to bringing an end to the war.National Security Advisers from around Europe, including the UK's Jonathan Powell, are meeting regularly with Ukrainian officials. Summaries of those conversations and others are then shared by allies with Washington.It is expected that were a point to be reached where a potential deal was arrived at, America would then lead a conversation with Moscow.At a White House briefing later on Wednesday, Trump admitted that \"strong words\" were used during the phone call.He said he was yet to decide on whether to agree with European proposals to hold more meetings this weekend involving Washington and Kyiv.\"We don't want to be wasting time,\" the US president said.He also called on Zelensky to be \"realistic\", saying that Ukrainians \"want a settlement... they wanna see it [the war] end\".Earlier on Wednesday, Zelensky wrote on social media that a 20-point document on how to end the war would be handed over to the US in \"the near future\" after \"our joint work with President Trump's team and partners in Europe\".The Ukrainian leader provided no further details.The original US draft peace plan - widely leaked to media last month - had 28 points, and was seen as favouring Russia. Ukraine has since held separate talks with US and European negotiators, seeking to change some key clauses such as territorial issues and security guarantees.Zelensky is under increasing pressure from Trump to agree to a peace deal to end the war, with the US president urging Kyiv to \"play ball\" by ceding territory to Moscow.Zelensky has repeatedly refused to do so, seeking instead an immediate ceasefire on the vast front line and iron-clad security guarantees for Kyiv in any future settlement.The Ukrainian leader is on a diplomatic tour of Europe following intensive talks between US and Ukrainian negotiators over the weekend which failed to produce a deal to which Kyiv could agree.Zelensky has been pressing his European allies to help deter the US from backing an agreement that could leave Ukraine exposed to future attacks by Russia. Meanwhile, the Kremlin said Trump's \"very important\" statements on Ukraine, including saying Moscow would win the war and that Kyiv would need to hand over land, align with Russia's view.\"In many ways, on the subject of Nato membership, on the subject of territories, on the subjects of how Ukraine is losing land, it is in tune with our understanding,\" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Last week, Putin repeated his warning that Ukrainian troops must completely withdraw from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.In recent weeks Russian troops have continued their slow advance in south-eastern Ukraine - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

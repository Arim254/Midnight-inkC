In August, she became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title - the second-highest ranking in women's chess, below grandmaster.  Yury KrylovBodhana became the youngest person to earn the Woman International Master title earlier this yearLast year, she made history as the youngest person ever to represent England internationally in any sport, at the age of just nine. Bodhana says she wants to become the youngest grandmaster in history. The current recordholder is American chess player Abhimanyu Mishra, who claimed the title at the age of just 12. Blitz is a type of speed chess in which each game lasts no more than ten minutes.",

The organisers said they were protesting \"against our Government's complicity in genocide and against the ban on [direct action group] Palestine Action\". Palestine Action was proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000 in July.In Bristol city centre, 31 people were arrested, while in Manchester, 34 were held at a rally attended by 200.In Birmingham, 25 protesters carrying placards expressing support for Palestine Action were arrested at a rally in Chamberlain Square in the city centre, West Midlands Police said.Ch Insp James Littlehales said: \"We fully recognise people's right to demonstrate peacefully, and many people continue to protest in support of Palestine without breaking the law.\"But we will take appropriate action where people are breaching the law by showing support for proscribed organisations.\"Greater Manchester Police said it had detainted 34 protesters in St Peter's Square for suspected terror offences.PAThousands of demonstrators marched in London at a separate rally organised by Palestine CoalitionIn Bristol, demonstrators congregated at College Green and 30 people were arrested on suspicion of displaying articles in support of a proscribed organisation.One woman was held on suspicion of failing to provide details under the Police Reform Act, Avon and Somerset Police said.Insp Ben Spence said: \"The protest has now safely concluded and the police operation has been stood down.\"Officers also arrested 10 protesters in Norwich.

    "body": "Pope Leo XIV has visited Istanbul's Sultan Ahmed Mosque - widely known as the Blue Mosque - in his first visit to a Muslim place of worship since he took up the papacy in May.The Pontiff was seen bowing as he entered the building, but it is reported he did not pray at the mosque, as his two predecessors had done.The Vatican said in a statement Leo undertook the tour \"in a spirit of reflection and listening, with deep respect for the place and for the faith of those who gather there in prayer\".The Pope is on a four-day trip to Turkey, after which he will visit Lebanon.He was later welcomed to St George's Cathedral in Istanbul by the head of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew.The Blue Mosque is officially named for Sultan Ahmed I, leader of the Ottoman Empire from 1603 to 1617, who oversaw its construction. It is decorated with thousands of blue and turquoise ceramic tiles and receives millions of visitors each year.Pope Francis prayed there in 2014, and Pope Benedict XVI did so in 2006.The first pope to officially enter a mosque was John Paul II, who made history when he visited the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus in 2001. The papal visit to Turkey and Lebanon had been planned by late Pope Francis, but its theme of building bridges was embraced by Pope Leo from the moment he stepped on the balcony of St Peter's Basilica after his election in May.At the start of his trip, he warned that the world should not give into \"a heightened level of conflict on the global level\", adding that \"the future of humanity is at stake\".In Lebanon - where an estimated third of the country is Christian - he is expected to meet more faith leaders and hear from young people. On the final day of the trip, he will celebrate Mass at the Beirut waterfront at the site of the 2020 port explosion, praying for the more than 200 people who were killed and 7,000 others injured.",

    "body": "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.  The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there. The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY\".The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\". US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs. The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".",

    "body": "1 hour agoSeher AsafandPatrick JacksonMatt HumphreySir Tom Stoppard, one of the UK’s best-known playwrights, has died aged 88, his agents have announced.Sir Tom, who won an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the screenplay for Shakespeare In Love, \"died peacefully at home in Dorset, surrounded by his family\".His other stage work included The Real Thing, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language,\" United Agents added. \"It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him.\"Playwright Sir Tom Stoppard dies at 88The playwright captivated the hearts of audiences for more than six decades with work that explored philosophical and political themes. Paying tribute to his \"favourite playwright\", Sir Mick Jagger posted on social media: \"He leaves us with a majestic body of intellectual and amusing work. I will always miss him.\"Publishing company Faber Books said Sir Tom was \"one of the most brilliant and feted playwrights of the last sixty years and one of the great intellects of our time\". \"Tom has been at the heart of Faber Drama since his first play, the dazzling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. He will be missed beyond measure,\" it added. He also wrote for film, TV and radio. He adapted Leo Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina for the 2012 film starring Keira Knightley and Jude Law. In 2020, he released his semi-autobiographical new work titled Leopoldstadt - set in the Jewish quarter of early 20th Century Vienna - which later won him an Olivier award for best new play and scooped four Tony awards.Born Tomas Straussler in Czechoslovakia, he fled his home during the Nazi occupation and found refuge in Britain. He later learned from relatives that all four of his grandparents had been Jewish, and that they had died in Nazi concentration camps. \"I feel incredibly lucky not to have had to survive or die. It's a conspicuous part of what might be termed a charmed life,\" he said in US magazine Talk in 1999, as he reflected on returning to his birthplace Zlin in what is now the Czech Republic.He worked as a journalist in Bristol in 1954 before becoming a theatre critic and writing plays for radio and TV.\"I wanted to be a great journalist,\" he said, as quoted by Reuters news agency. \"My first ambition was to be lying on the floor of an African airport while machine-gun bullets zoomed over my typewriter. But I wasn't much use as a reporter. I felt I didn't have the right to ask people questions.\"I always thought they'd throw the teapot at me or call the police.\"Sir Tom's career as a playwright did not take off until the 1960s when Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was later performed at the National Theatre and Broadway.The play focuses on two minor characters from Hamlet. It won several awards including four Tonys in 1968, including best play.He received many honours and accolades throughout his career, including being knighted by the late Queen for his services to literature in 1997.Getty ImagesTom Stoppard at the 76th annual Tony Awards in 2023",

    "body": "3 hours agoJessica RawnsleyGetty ImagesSearch and rescue operations are ongoing across Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, with hundreds still missingTorrential rains have triggered floods and landslides across parts of southern Asia, killing about 600 people.Monsoon rain exacerbated by tropical storms caused some of the region's worst flooding in years, with millions affected in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Sri Lanka.Intense rainfall began on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday. \"During the flood, everything was gone,\" a resident of Bireuen in Sumatra's Aceh province told Reuters news agency. \"I wanted to save my clothes, but my house came down.\" With hundreds still missing, the death toll is likely to rise. Thousands remain stranded, some awaiting rescue on rooftops.As of Saturday more than 300 people had died in Indonesia and 160 in Thailand. There were also several deaths reported in Malaysia.In Sri Lanka, which has been battered by Cyclone Ditwah, more than 130 people are dead and some 170 missing, officials said.Getty ImagesIn Indonesia hundreds are still missing after heavy rains wreaked havoc on the island of SumatraAn exceptionally rare tropical cyclone, named Cyclone Senyar, caused catastrophic landslides and flooding in Indonesia, with homes swept away and thousands of buildings submerged.Indonesia's disaster agency said on Saturday that nearly 300 people were still missing after flooding devastated Sumatra.\"The current was very fast, in a matter of seconds it reached the streets, entered the houses,\" a resident in Aceh Province, Arini Amalia, told the BBC. She and her grandmother raced to a relative's house on higher terrain. On returning the following day to retrieve some belongings, she said the flood had completely swallowed the house: \"It's already sunk.\"After waters rapidly rose in West Sumatra and submerged his home, Meri Osman said he was \"swept away by the current\" and clung onto a clothesline until he was rescued.The bad weather has hampered rescue operations, and while tens of thousands of people have been evacuated, hundreds are still stranded, the Indonesian disaster agency said.Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people have taken refuge in shelters in ThailandIn Thailand's southern Songkhla province, water rose 3m (10ft) and at least 145 people died in one of the worst floods in a decade.Across the 10 provinces hit by flooding, more than 160 people have been killed, the government said on Saturday. More than 3.8 million people have been affected.The city of Hat Yai experienced 335mm of rainfall in a single day, the heaviest in 300 years. As waters receded, officials recorded a sharp rise in the death toll. At one hospital in Hat Yai, employees were forced to move bodies to refrigerated trucks after the morgue became overwhelmed, news agency AFP reported.\"We were stuck in the water for seven days and no agency came to help,\" Hat Yai resident Thanita Khiawhom told BBC Thai.The government has promised relief measures, including compensation of up to two million baht ($62,000) for households that lost family members. Getty ImagesSri Lanka's government has declared a state of emergency and appealed for international assistanceIn neighbouring Malaysia, the death toll is far lower, but the damage is just as devastating.Flooding has wreaked havoc and left parts of northern Perlis state under water, with two people dead and tens of thousands forced into shelters.Sri Lanka is also grappling with one of its worst weather disasters in recent years, and the government has declared a state of emergency.More than 15,000 homes have been destroyed and some 78,000 people forced into temporary shelters, officials said. They added that about a third of the country was without electricity or running water.Meteorologists have said the extreme weather in South East Asia may have been caused by the interaction of Typhoon Koto in the Philippines and the rare formation of Cyclone Senyar in the Malacca Strait.The region's annual monsoon season, typically between June and September, often brings heavy rain.Climate change has altered storm patterns, including the intensity and duration of the season, resulting in heavier rainfall, flash flooding and stronger winds.More on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterZarah Sultana has accused leading figures in the new party she is founding with Jeremy Corbyn of carrying out a \"witch hunt\" to purge left-wing activists.Sultana boycotted the first day of the founding conference of the project, currently operating under the name Your Party, after several members who also belonged to the Socialist Workers Party were expelled.Party officials said the expulsions were for breaching rules that ban members from joining any other political party in the UK or abroad.Sultana's comments came as Corbyn used his conference speech to call for unity as the party had \"a unique opportunity\" to found \"a socialist party of mass appeal\".She told the BBC one of her staff had also been denied a pass for the conference. Your Party officials confirmed a pass had not been issued but denied the decision had been politically motivated. A spokesperson for Sultana said: \"This witch hunt is indefensible - we must build a party that welcomes all socialists.\"Asked by the BBC if she stood by the claim there was a witch hunt, Sultana said: \"Absolutely.\"\"And it is disgusting to see the type of behaviour we have seen in the Labour Party,\" she added. \"It's a toxic culture we're not seeking to replicate here.\"Sultana said \"nameless and faceless bureaucrats\" were \"working in the shadows\" to expel people \"without the membership actually voting on it\".Members of other groups \"shouldn't be made to choose\" between their membership and \"our new party\", Sultana said.A Your Party spokesman said: \"Members of another national political party signed up to Your Party in contravention of clearly stated membership rules - and these rules were enforced. \"We're focused on hosting a democratic founding conference with thousands of members coming together to debate and decide the big issues. \"This is politics outside the Westminster mould: from the ground up, not the top down.\"During his speech, Corbyn admitted there had been \"mistakes\" during the party's turbulent founding - a process that has seen Sultana frequently at odds with party officials and two MPs resign from the project.Adnan Hussain and Iqbal Mohamed quit within a week of each other, citing internal tensions.Before leaving, both Hussain and Mohamed had put their names to a letter criticising Sultana for failing to transfer an estimated £800,000 of Your Party donations held by a company she controls.The money is held by MoU Operations Ltd, which collected the initial waves of donations while Your Party was being formally registered.Sultana has transferred £600,000, promising any remaining money will be paid \"as soon as possible, as the legal details are ironed out\".Speaking on Saturday, Corbyn said: \"As a party, we've got to come together and be united, because division and disunity will not serve the interests of the people that we want to represent.\"He also called for \"public, democratic ownership\" of the water industry, led a chant of \"free, free Palestine\" and urged party members to \"campaign forevermore for real socialism and real social justice\".",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain4 days agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" the lead author of the research, Dr Alexa Mousley, told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge and part of the team responsible for the research, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"The director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, Prof Tara Spires-Jones, who did not work on the research paper, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

    "body": "Fall of Zelensky's top aide - reboot for Kyiv or costly shake-up?9 hours agoJames WaterhouseUkraine correspondent, KyivReutersAndriy Yermak was one of Ukraine's most powerful figuresAndriy Yermak was a constant, looming presence in Ukraine's government - a seemingly immovable figure on the political stage.Despite his towering frame, you might not always have spotted him. Yet, wherever President Volodymyr Zelensky was, Yermak was often not far away.As his chief of staff, Yermak wielded enormous power at the top of government and was even trusted to negotiate on Ukraine's behalf at peace talks with the US.But as his influence grew, so did public resentment of the power this unelected official held. His political career came to an abrupt end on Friday, hours after anti-corruption investigators raided his home in Kyiv.Yermak and Zelensky first met in 2011 when the former was an intellectual property lawyer and the latter a TV producer.After working together during the successful presidential campaign of 2019, Yermak became Zelensky's chief of staff. He stood next to the president as he gave his now famous \"we are still here\" speech as the Russians descended on Kyiv at the start of their full-scale invasion in February 2022.As Zelensky concentrated his power over time, Yermak was widely viewed as the second most powerful person in Ukraine. He reportedly helped shape foreign policy, ousted political rivals and even made battlefield decisions.ReutersYermak (right) was always at the centre of the action in Ukraine's governmentUkrainian politics is shaped by big characters, and Zelensky's administration had not one, but two of them.Despite the favourable conditions Yermak enjoyed within the sprawling Presidential Office, the same couldn't be said outside its steep walls.His popularity was nosediving.A widening scandalZelensky had successfully grappled with corruption scandals in the past, but in July a chain of events began that has shaken the current government to its core, weakening him politically and costing him his right-hand man.That month, the president convinced parliament to formally remove the independence of Ukraine's two anti-corruption bodies and bring them under direct government control.At the time, Zelensky said it was to limit Russian interference. But the public - as well as the European Union - disagreed, and he was forced to U-turn after mass demonstrations.Getty ImagesThe decision to strip anti-corruption bodies of their independence sparked mass protests, which in turn forced a government U-turnBy the autumn, those same agencies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sapo), released the findings of a lengthy investigation that implicated members of Zelensky's inner circles.Senior figures - including two ministers, a former deputy prime minister and a one-time business partner of Zelensky's - were accused of syphoning $100m (£75m) from public projects in the energy sector.At a time when Russia is pummelling Ukraine's energy grid with missiles and drones ahead of a fourth winter of war - forcing the entire country to endure daily power cuts - public anger at these corruption allegations has soared. Just on Friday night alone, Kyiv endured a nearly 11-hour-long Russian air raid, which left more than half a million people without power.\"We're going through one of the most difficult times in our history,\" Iryna, a Kyiv resident, told the BBC this week. \"Unfortunately, lots of families will not see their loved ones, their men, brothers or husbands, because of the war.\"Despite not being named as a suspect and denying any involvement in the scheme, Andriy Yermak couldn't distance himself. There was a suspicion he may have known something. Local media reported on Saturday that investigators were combing through several laptops and mobile phones they had seized from his flat during their search.Yermak led last week's talks with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Geneva, apparently securing some concessions for his country in a US-drafted peace proposal which many feared heavily favoured Russia.Getty ImagesMr Yermak was a key figure in negotiations with the USAt a time when Ukraine is fighting and negotiating for its very survival, his resignation is hugely destabilising.Talks will continue next week. Ukraine's presidential office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Rustem Umerov was the head of a delegation heading to the US.What is not known is whether this will be a timely reboot for Kyiv, or a costly lack of continuity.It is also not known how Yermak is taking his sudden departure from government. The New York Post reported on Saturday that he had texted their paper and vowed to go to the front line. He also declared his innocence. \"I'm going to the front and am prepared for any reprisals,\" he reportedly said. \"I am an honest and decent person.\"But there is a feeling that Yermak's departure is a sign of positive change.\"Let's call it what it is: good news,\" says Olga Rudenko, editor of the Kyiv Independent.\"Think about it: a young democracy like Ukraine has independent institutions that are strong enough to investigate the most powerful man in the country - and to do so during the war.\"People rooting for Ukraine around the world aren't rooting for a place on the map, but for a place living by certain values - and fighting for them. Today we see these values in action.\"This shows why Ukraine is exactly the country worth supporting.\"Additional reporting by Toby Luckhurst",

    "body": "2 hours agoPlaywright Sir Tom Stoppard dies at 88Sir Tom Stoppard, who has died at the age of 88, was one of Britain's cleverest playwrights. His writing was witty and playful, he took ideas seriously and delighted in philosophical and political argument.He had a parallel career as a Hollywood script doctor, much in demand to add sparkle to others' film scripts, and shared a best-screenplay Oscar for his entertaining contribution to Shakespeare in Love.He was a writer who managed to combine an intellectual's delight in complexity with an entertainer's talent for having fun. Plays like Arcadia, Jumpers and the work which first made his name, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, were sometimes criticised for lacking emotional depth, for being too much show and too little substance.But his later work displayed greater human sympathy, even if it was sometimes coolly received by the critics.Perhaps his particular qualities as a playwright reflected his background: part Mitteleuropean intellectual, part self-deprecating, public-school educated, cricket-loving Englishman.Getty ImagesHe worked as a journalist before finding success as a writerHe was born Tomas Straussler on 3 July 1937 in what was then Czechoslovakia, where his Jewish father worked as a doctor for the Bata shoe company.  His parents fled from imminent Nazi occupation when he was still a baby and went to Singapore, where his father died in a Japanese prison camp.Tom and his mother and brother had escaped ahead of the Japanese invasion and went first to Australia, later to India. There his mother met and married an Englishman, a Major Stoppard.Intellectual conceitsStoppard became a journalist, initially on the Western Daily Press in Bristol.  An early break came in 1963 when his first stage play A Walk on the Water (later retitled Enter a Free Man) was broadcast on ITV.But the play that really catapulted him to fame was Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, which premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in 1966 and transferred to London's National Theatre in 1967.   It took two minor characters from Shakespeare's Hamlet and put them centre stage, baffled and bewildered by the seemingly arbitrary events swirling around them.It was brilliant: like Samuel Beckett, but with much better jokes.Rex FeaturesHis second marriage was to doctor and TV presenter Miriam StoppardHe followed it with a succession of intensely theatrical divertissements, often revolving around unexpected intellectual conceits or bizarre juxtapositions and featuring brilliant dialogue, puns, repartee, double meanings and misunderstandings.Jumpers was a play about academic philosophy and gymnastics. Travesties was set in Zurich during World War One and featured Lenin, James Joyce, the Dadaist Tristan Tzara and The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde - to whose bright, brittle and self-consciously clever plays Stoppard's were sometimes compared.Later in his career, in similar vein, he wrote Hapgood, a play about espionage and quantum physics, and Arcadia, about mathematics, thermodynamics, literature, and landscape gardening. He claimed to write plays as much to discover what he really thought as to explore his existing ideas.Love and infidelityHe also wrote for radio.  If You're Glad I'll Be Frank imagined the speaking clock as a real woman speaking live, her internal monologue utterly at odds with the deadening repetitiveness of endlessly intoning \"at the third stroke...\".  Albert's Bridge was about a man painting a bridge, with philosophy and mathematics thrown in.As the years passed, his writing became more serious, more political and more empathetic. \"I slowly learned that plays work best if you let them have some blood heat, and not simply be exciting exchanges of witty ideas,\" he told Joan Bakewell in a revealing interview in 2002.  \"It's the humanity of the characters that gives theatre the possibility of being great art.\"Rex FeaturesThe Real Thing, Stoppard's study of adultery, featured Felicity Kendal with whom he later had a relationshipSo Night and Day was about journalism and its purposes; the Real Thing was about love and infidelity and starred Felicity Kendal, for whom Stoppard left his second wife, the doctor and broadcaster Miriam Stoppard.Every Good Boy Deserves Favour put a symphony orchestra on stage alongside the actors in a savage satire which dramatised the plight of Soviet dissidents locked away in mental hospitals. \"I have no symptoms, I have opinions,\" a patient says at one point. \"Your opinions are your symptoms. Your disease is dissent,\" replies his doctor. It was the sort of paradox Stoppard loved to explore.The Coast of Utopia was a massive trilogy about the 19th Century Russian liberal thinker, Alexander Herzen: coolly received at the National Theatre in London, it was a huge success in New York.  And Rock'n'Roll was about the stifling repression of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia.ScreenwriterHis plays displayed considerable erudition. \"I always wanted to know about a lot of things, but not particularly deeply,\" he told Joan Bakewell. \"I like facts, I like knowledge, I like having wide interests. There's various ways of describing such a person, dilettante might be one way and polymath might be another.\"\"To write a play at all I do have to get hold of that fix, that charge, that juice which comes from getting really, really interested in a small area - it might be a scientific thing, it might be a philosophical thing, it might be an historical thing - but a real unforced, uncontainable fascination for something, from which everything else then becomes a play.\"Ronald GrantStoppard (R) directed the film of his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are DeadSir Tom was a successful screenwriter as well as a playwright. Several of his plays, notably Professional Foul, which was born of his engagement with the Czech dissident movement Charter 77, were originally written for television.He adapted Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat for television, co-wrote Terry Gilliam's dystopian fantasy Brazil, supplied much of the dialogue for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (though he wasn't credited) and adapted John Le Carre, Tolstoy and Robert Harris for the screen.  And in 1998 he shared a best screenplay Oscar for his contribution to Shakespeare in Love.He was knighted in 1997 and awarded the Order of Merit in 2000. In 2014, he married his third wife, heiress and television producer Sabrina Guinness.As he grew older, he claimed, the writing process grew no easier. \"Each time I'm in this leaky boat I go through this ridiculous exercise of trying to remember how I got hold of the last play. And I never do remember,\" he told one interviewer.\"I cannot remember now how I got into Rock'n'Roll, I wish I could, I'd do it again. But in the absence of anything to go on I just sort of read the papers, chat to people, hang about and worry about it before I go to sleep.\"",

    "body": "Oscar Piastri cut McLaren team-mate Lando Norris' championship lead by two points with victory in the sprint race at the Qatar Grand Prix.The Australian led an uneventful race from start to finish as Norris trailed home behind Mercedes' George Russell, the top three finishing in the order in which they started.Red Bull's Max Verstappen moved up from sixth on the grid to finish fourth, losing one point to Norris in the championship.Norris now leads Piastri by 22 points and Verstappen by 25 heading into Sunday's grand prix.If Norris wins the grand prix, he will be champion. If either Piastri or Verstappen does, then the battle will go to the final race in Abu Dhabi next weekend.Verstappen made up two places at the start as he followed team-mate Yuki Tsunoda past the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso, who had excelled in putting his uncompetitive car fourth on the grid, and the Japanese then let the Dutchman past.Verstappen challenged Norris for the first few laps, even feigning an overtaking attempt on the Briton at one point, but eventually began to drop back complaining of bouncing and jumping from his car.After the first three corners, the only overtaking move in the points positions was when Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli took advantage of Alonso running wide out of the final corner at the end of lap 12 to pass down the inside of Turn One at the start of the following lap.Both Tsunoda and Antonelli were given five-second penalties for exceeding track limits too many times, leaving both in the same fifth and sixth positions.Alonso took two valuable points for Aston Martin in seventh while Williams' Carlos Sainz earned the final point in eighth.Ferrari had a dire race. Charles Leclerc dropped from ninth on the grid to finish 13th, after two off-track moments, while Lewis Hamilton finished 17th after starting from the pit lane.",

    "body": "Oscar Piastri pipped McLaren team-mate and title rival Lando Norris to pole position for the potentially title-deciding Qatar Grand Prix.The Australian beat Norris by 0.108 seconds after Norris, who had been fastest on their first runs by 0.035secs, aborted his final lap.That gave Piastri the chance to put himself in a great position to win the race and take the title battle to a final-race decider in Abu Dhabi next weekend.Red Bull's Max Verstappen, the other title contender, will start third, also a threat to Norris. The Dutchman has to finish ahead of Norris to keep his chances alive.Norris will become champion on Sunday if he wins the race, or beats Piastri and Verstappen, but he blinked first as the tensions rose in one of the most crucial qualifying sessions of the weekend.Norris was blisteringly quick on his first lap but a loss of front grip in Turn Two on his second meant he had to abort and opened the door to his team-mate.Piastri delivered with a superb lap to give himself the perfect opportunity to keep his title hopes alive.Norris said: \"I just got a bit of understeer and was going go off and had to abort. But it's the way it is.\"Oscar did a good job and has been driving very well all weekend. Nothing to complain about, just didn't do the lap. All to play for tomorrow.Piastri said: \"Everything felt great all weekend. The team did a great job, had a little bit of a question mark on which tyres I wanted to use.\"Did a lap on the used set and that threw a spanner in the works because didn't expect them to be so good but went well on the new ones.\"Tonight we will review some things and see what I can do better than this morning, we are in a good position, progress, but it's a long race.\"Verstappen had struggled with his car in sprint qualifying and the sprint, complaining of bouncing. Red Bull had improved it for qualifying but it was still not enough to challenge the McLarens and he ended up 0.264secs off the pace.He will be eyeing beating Norris into the first corner, knowing that, with overtaking so difficult, it might be his only hope of retaining his title chances.\"This qualifying was a little bit better even though we were still quite far off. Still some limitations (in the car).\"But at least we are P3 and it creates better opportunities because we know it is quite hard to pass around here.\"Mercedes driver George Russell could not repeat the second place he achieved in the sprint and was fourth, just 0.011secs behind Verstappen, with his team-mate Kimi Antonelli in fifth, ahead of the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar.Williams' Carlos Sainz, Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso, Alpine's Pierre Gasly and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completed the top 10.Leclerc survived a huge, high-speed spin out of Turn 15 on his first lap, but he fared better than team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who is having his worst weekend of the season.After qualifying 18th for the sprint, and finishing only one place higher, Hamilton ended up in the same place on the grid for the grand prix.The seven-time champion said: \"I was generally feeling better. We made changes. The car was feeling better. Just wasn't great.\"Asked by a television interviewer for F1's in-house channel for a message for his fans, he said: \"I don't really have a message right now. I'm sorry. But I'm incredibly grateful for the support I've had all year. I wouldn't have made it through this year without them.\"",

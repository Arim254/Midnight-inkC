From the Epstein Files to the cost of living, Greene has been vocal in her criticism of the current administration.  It’s notable because MTG has been one of Trump’s most loyal allies and a powerful leader of the MAGA movement, and also because her interventions have been influential. \nSarah, Anthony and Marianna look back at Marjorie Taylor Greene’s rise and why she has been such an influential figure within Donald Trump’s MAGA base. \nAnd, Anthony’s in Tennessee for a special election where a House seat is being contested.

    "body": "Pioneering Australian chef Skye Gyngell has died aged 62.Gyngell rose to fame in the UK after her garden centre cafe in south-west London was awarded a coveted Michelin star, one of the highest culinary honours. She went on to helm Spring restaurant at Somerset House and Marle and Hearth at Heckfield Place in Hampshire.Gyngell's family said she died on Saturday in London, describing her as a \"culinary visionary who influenced generations of chefs and growers globally to think about food and its connection to the land\". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver paid tribute to Gyngell - who was diagnosed with skin cancer last year - and thanked her for \"all you did to inspire young cooks\".During the 1980s, Gyngell pioneered the \"slow food movement\" before becoming a private chef for clients including Nigella Lawson, Madonna and Guy Ritchie.Lawson mourned her death, writing on Instagram, \"However ill you know someone to be, their death is always a shock. It's just awful that Skye is no longer in the world.\"Gyngell died just days after her mother, Ann Barr, who was a well-known interior designer.Her father, Bruce Gyngell, was the first person to appear on Australian television in 1956 with the line: \"Good evening, and welcome to television\". He died in 2000.Born in Sydney, Skye Gyngell was studying at Sydney University when she realised the culinary world was where she wanted to be. She moved to Paris at 19, where she trained and worked under acclaimed chefs including at the two Michelin-starred restaurant Dodin-Bouffant.Gyngell later moved to London and worked at the French House in Soho with Fergus and Margot Henderson.In 2004, Gyngell became head chef at Petersham Nurseries cafe in Richmond, where she  turned the dilapidated site into a thriving cafe, and in 2011, it was awarded a Michelin star.But the kudos was a double-edged sword for Gyngell, who left the cafe a year after the award, saying she was frustrated by customers who expected a traditional Michelin experience at her rustic cafe.Her later ventures included Spring at Somerset House, which was the first single-use plastic-free restaurant in London. Gyngell, who overcame drug and alcohol addiction in her younger years, was also known for her award-winning cookbooks and wrote columns for Vogue as its food editor.Last year, she found a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive skin cancer.She underwent an operation which included the removal of her salivary glands, causing her to temporarily lose her sense of smell and taste.Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "16 hours agoDearbail JordanUK Ministry of DefenceA view from HMS Severn as it tracks Russia's RFN Stoikiy in the English ChannelTwo Russian warships were intercepted in the English Channel by the Royal Navy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said.In the latest incident involving Russia's ships entering waters around the UK, HMS Severn headed off the RFN Stoikiy, a corvette and Yelnya, a tanker, as they sailed west through the Dover Strait into the English Channel in the past fortnight.Last week, it emerged that the Russian spy ship Yantar was spotted off the coast of Scotland and it used lasers to disrupt RAF pilots tracking its movements.Defence Secretary John Healey branded the Yantar's move \"deeply dangerous\" and warned Russia and its president Vladimir Putin: \"We see you. We know what you're doing. We are ready.\"Healey said last week that there had been a 30% increase in Russian vessels threatening UK waters in the past two years.The MoD said after intercepting the Stoikiy and the Yelnya, the HMS Severn later handed over monitoring duties to a Nato ally off the coast of Brittany, north west France.It said the UK ship \"continued to observe from a distance and remained ready to respond to any unexpected activity\".It is not the first time the Stoikiy has been in British territory.In May, the Royal Navy dispatched two vessels and the 814 Naval Air Squadron - also known as the \"flying tigers\" - to shadow the Russian warship as it sailed west through the English Channel to meet the Sparta IV and General Skobelev.The two merchant vessels were returning from the Mediterranean and the group headed back to the Baltic Sea, watched by HMS Hurworth.Healey has said that the rise in Russian activity in UK waters was evidence of increased \"Russian aggression right across the board\" which he says is impacting Europe, not just Ukraine.At a news conference in Downing Street last week, the defence secretary said he had changed the Royal Navy's rules of engagement so that it could follow the Yantar more closely \"when it is in our wider waters\".Built in 2002, HMS Severn is a River-class offshore patrol vessel. Together with her sister ships, HMS Tyne and HMS Mersey, the Royal Navy says the ships are able to \"escort passing foreign warships, mount fishing vessel inspections and defend the UK border\".",

    "body": "28 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesHinkley Point C in Somerset is under constructionThe UK has become the \"most expensive place in the world\" to build nuclear power plants, according to a government review which criticises \"overly complex\" bureaucracy around the sector.The report, which was commissioned by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calls for a  \"one-stop shop\" for nuclear decisions. A \"radical reset\" of the rules around nuclear power could save Britain \"tens of billions\" in costs and reverse the industry's \"decline\" in recent years, the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce said.It comes as the UK government looks to build a new generation of nuclear plants to meet the country's future energy needs and net zero targets.Hinkley Point C in Somerset is expected to start operating in the early 2030s, while Sizewell C - which the government says will be capable of powering six million homes - will follow later that decade. The UK is also setting up small nuclear power stations, which are faster to build than full-size reactors.The taskforce's report said the planning system needed to be streamlined and the risks associated with nuclear energy should be brought in line with the rest of the worldIt said the UK had excessively risk-averse policies in place, including \"overly conservative\" rules on radiation exposure levels for workers.A \"fragmented\" regulatory system has led to \"conservative and costly decisions not proportionate to the actual risk being managed\", it said.The report said nuclear plants - which generate electricity by using atomic reactions to produce heat - were \"essential to the UK's future\", with the country at risk of missing out on a \"worldwide nuclear renaissance\".Taskforce chair John Fingleton said: \"Our solutions are radical, but necessary. By simplifying regulation, we can maintain or enhance safety standards while finally delivering nuclear capacity safely, quickly, and affordably.\"Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fingleton said the UK's regulations  have \"made us the most expensive place in the world to build nuclear\".Limitations on exposure to radiation are stricter in an energy setting than in a dentists or doctors, he said.\"Motorways wouldn't be very useful if we all drove at five miles an hour but that's sort of what we're doing in nuclear safety.\"The government is expected to address the report's findings later this month in the Budget.Several major economies are reassessing their nuclear strategies and expanding capacity. The number of planned and proposed nuclear plants currently in the works is roughly equivalent to the number already in operation around the world.The UK is among 30 other countries that have signed a global pledge to triple their nuclear capacity by 2050 in a bid to cut carbon emissions.Britain's existing nuclear power stations account for about 15% of the electricity generated in 2024.The UK runs nine nuclear reactors but they are ageing, with eight set to shut by 2030, and the new plants will take several years to come online.Beyond the UK, France plans to build at least six new reactors, while China has nearly 30 under construction.The US completed its first new reactor in over three decades last year, and Japan - which temporarily shuttered its nuclear programme after the 2011 meltdown at Fukushima - now plans for it to supply a fifth of its electricity by 2040.In contrast, Germany has phased out its use of nuclear power, prioritising alternative renewables like hydrogen.The development of nuclear energy remains divisive, with public opinion shaded by high-profile safety incidents, including Fukushima and the 1986 disaster at Chernobyl.

    "body": "7 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterPA MediaThe Princess of Wales has called for an end to the \"stigma\" surrounding addiction, and urged people to offer \"empathy and support\" to those dependent on alcohol, drugs or gambling.Catherine, who sent the message to mark Addiction Awareness Week, said \"significant progress\" has been made to better understand addiction, but warned more needs to be done.The princess is the patron of The Forward Trust, a charity that tries to break the cycle of addiction and is behind the campaign running from 23-30 November.Catherine, who has also campaigned on mental health issues, draws parallels between the two conditions in her message.She said addiction was \"not a choice or a personal failing, but a complex mental health condition that should be met with empathy and support.She added: \"But still, even now in 2025, people's experience of addiction is shaped by fear, shame and judgement. This needs to change.\"The stigma surrounding those who face addiction allows it to thrive behind closed doors, impacting families and communities, and ultimately ruining lives.\"The princess said that many people will know someone who is struggling with addiction.\"Now is the moment to show our compassion and love to help them, or their friends and family, to reach out to organisations like The Forward Trust for support,\" she said.\"Recovery is hard, but with the right treatment it is possible. And this begins with a conversation, a listening ear and showing we care.\"Catherine launched the first Addiction Awareness Week in 2021 on behalf of the trust and its Taking Action on Addiction campaign.She concluded her message by urging people to have open conversations to bring addiction and the harm it causes \"out of the shadows\".PA MediaCatherine launched the charity's campaign in 2021It is not the first time Catherine has spoken out on the issue of addiction.In 2022, she gave her personal support to people struggling with addictions, telling them shame should not stop them getting help and urging a more compassionate public attitude towards the condition.Former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who spent 11 years in addiction, has also recorded a video to launch a series of films demonstrating the power of open conversations in the journey to recovery.In the film, he reveals that a conversation with his mother-in-law Barbara was the catalyst to getting help.Adams, who is now chairman of trustees at the Forward Trust, said: \"If you are struggling with an addiction or a mental health issue, then please reach out and get the appropriate help. The greatest thing I ever did was to say, 'I can't do this'.\"The charity provides services including helping with employment and addressing the problems of addicts and addictions in prison.Before the Princess of Wales became the Forward Trust's patron, she had twice visited the charity's substance misuse services at HMP Send, a women's prison in Surrey.The trust has also called for greater recognition of the scale of gambling inside prisons.",

    "body": "13 hours agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent, BeirutIsrael's military has killed a senior member of the militant group Hezbollah in an air strike on the southern suburbs of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, despite a ceasefire.It described Haitham Ali al-Tabtabai, Hezbollah's chief of staff, as a veteran of the group who had held a series of senior positions.Lebanon's health ministry said at least five people were killed and 28 others wounded in the strike, which hit an apartment building in the densely populated Dahieh district.Hezbollah confirmed Tabtabai's death, adding Israel had crossed a \"red line\" in carrying out the strike.The strike is Israel's first on southern Beirut for months.It comes as Israel has escalated its campaign on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah - a Shia Muslim group supported by Iran - despite a ceasefire brokered by the US and France that came into effect last November.Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been trying to rebuild its military capabilities, is smuggling weapons into Lebanon and stepping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles, and there are growing fears of an escalation of hostilities.In a statement after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"Under my leadership, the State of Israel will not allow Hezbollah to rebuild its power, and we will not allow it to once again pose a threat to the State of Israel.\"He said he expected the Lebanese government \"to fulfill its commitment to disarm Hezbollah\".Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has urged the international community to put pressure on Israel - which continues to occupy at least five locations in southern Lebanon - to stop the attacks and withdraw from the country, saying the Israeli actions are a violation of the agreement that put an end to 13 months of conflict.The Lebanese government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but the group has rejected calls to discuss the future of its weapons before Israel stops its attacks, fully withdraws from Lebanon, and releases Lebanese prisoners. A Western diplomatic official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the authorities are under pressure from the Trump administration, which is growing impatient with what they see as the slow progress against the group, considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the US and UK.The latest conflict between Israel and Hezbollah erupted after the Lebanese group started firing rockets at Israeli positions the day after the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. Hezbollah said it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.Lebanese authorities said Israel's attacks killed about 4,000 people there - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. Israeli authorities said more than 80 of its soldiers and 47 of its civilians were killed in the hostilities.The US government imposed sanctions on Tabtabai in 2016 and designated him a terrorist. It has a $5m (£3.8m) award on offer for information about him.The US described him as a key Hezbollah military leader who once commanded the group's special forces in Syria and Yemen, adding his actions in these countries were part of a larger Hezbollah effort to provide training, material, and personnel \"in support of its destabilising regional activities\".",

    "body": "Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett and former prime minister Baroness Theresa May are among the six public figures who will guest edit BBC Radio 4's Today programme over the Christmas period.Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, historian and podcaster Tom Holland, inventor Sir James Dyson and Microsoft's head of artificial intelligence (AI) Mustafa Suleyman will also guest edit shows between 24 December and 31 December.For the past 22 years, the news programme has handed over the editorial reins to guest editors during the festive period.Owenna Griffiths, editor of Today, said: \"In a rapidly changing world, this year's guest editors will help bring illumination and understanding\".She added: \"Every Christmas on Today, a new set of guest editors take up residence and bring with them a wonderful range of new stories, fresh ideas and, hopefully, a sprinkling of joy. This year is no exception.\"Blanchett's show on 27 December is set to look at the impact of AI technology on women in the film industry, and how different countries are responding to the refugee crisis.She is also expected to explore sustainability in the fashion industry and why gardening is good for the soul.The guest editors kick off on Christmas Eve, with a programme from Bragg focused on the origins of the nativity story, as well as changing social attitudes to mental health. He will also examine the value of culture in British society as he looks back on his six-decade career, which has included The South Bank Show, as well as Radio 4 documentary series In Our Time. On Boxing Day, an edit by Sir James - the billionaire inventor of the bagless vacuum cleaner - will consider how the UK could boost its entrepreneurial spirit.Other topics up for discussion in his programme include how close we are to finding a dementia cure and the science behind long-distance running.Suleyman is scheduled to look at how we could navigate the realities of a potential world with artificial super intelligence on 29 December.He is also set to reflect on what AI will mean for some of the core aspects of human existence.Holland's show on 30 December is set to celebrate England's 1,100th birthday and explore the impact of AI on academic research.Then on New Year's Eve, Baroness May's guest edit is set to cover domestic violence, trust in politics and modern slavery. Since the Christmas guest edit feature was introduced to Today in 2003, guest editors on the show have included physicist Stephen Hawking, actress Angelina Jolie and singer Ellie Goulding.",

    "body": "Former Prime Minister David Cameron has revealed he has been treated for prostate cancer.Lord Cameron, 59, told the Times newspaper his wife had insisted he go for a check-up after they listened to a BBC radio interview with entrepreneur Nick Jones, who was campaigning for more men to be tested after being diagnosed himself.The Tory peer had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test earlier this year, followed by an MRI scan and a biopsy. He was then treated with focal therapy, which targets the area where the tumour is present using methods such as ultrasound waves to destroy cancer cells.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in males in the UK, with around 55,000 new cases every year.A PSA test looks for proteins associated with prostate cancer and the result was high in Lord Cameron's case.He told the newspaper he wanted to use his platform to support a call by Prostate Cancer Research, a charity which counts Mr Jones - founder of private members' club chain Soho House - as a trustee, for screening to be offered to high-risk men.The cancer is most common in older age - particularly among men over 75. Cases in the under-50s are rare. It is also more common in black men.\"I don't particularly like discussing my personal intimate health issues, but I feel I ought to,\" Lord Cameron said.\"Let's be honest. Men are not very good at talking about their health. We tend to put things off.\"But he said: \"I sort of thought, well, this has happened to you, and you should lend your voice to it.\"Lord Cameron, Conservative prime minister between 2010 and 2016, and later foreign secretary in Rishi Sunak's government, told the Times: \"I would feel bad if I didn't come forward and say that I've had this experience. \"I had a scan. It helped me discover something that was wrong. It gave me the chance to deal with it.\"There is currently no screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK because of concerns about the accuracy of PSA tests.A high PSA does not always mean cancer. It can go up if there is an infection, for example.Currently, men over 50 can request a PSA test, which looks for abnormally high levels of protein in the blood, but this is unreliable, picking up many prostate cancers that would never need treatment, and missing others that do.Some men with a raised PSA may have a prostate cancer that would not have caused problems or needed treatment, causing unnecessary worry and further investigations.The peer's intervention comes days after a major prostate cancer screening trial began in the country. It is aimed at finding the best way to detect the disease by comparing it to current NHS diagnostic practices - which can include blood tests and biopsies.Prostate Cancer UK is jointly funding the programme. Its director of health services Chiara De Biase praised Lord Cameron for sharing his story and raising \"vital awareness\".\"We lose 12,000 dads, brothers, sons and friends to this disease every year. We've reached a tipping point in the UK, with too many men dying from a curable disease,\" De Biase said.\"Prostate cancer is the last major cancer without a screening programme, and we need change now.\"Around one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lives, according to the charity, with research showing it has overtaken breast cancer as the most commonly diagnosed form of the disease in the UK.Last year, the Scottish cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy called for more younger men to be tested for prostate cancer, following his own diagnosis. Health Secretary Wes Streeting later said he had \"asked the NHS to look at the case for lowering the age\" for routine PSA tests. Current NHS guidelines for England say anyone can request a test if they are over the age of 50. Sir Chris, 49, has advanced cancer that has spread to his bones and is terminal. It was discovered after a routine scan for shoulder pain revealed a tumour.Speaking to the BBC last November about his diagnosis, the Olympic champion said it was \"the biggest shock of my life\". He added: \"My perspective on life has changed massively. I am more thankful, I'm more grateful for each day.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoCaroline Davies,Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad and Azizullah Khan,BBC Urdu, PeshawarTwo suicide bombers have attacked the headquarters of a Pakistani paramilitary force on Monday, killing three security officials and wounding at least 12 people.Police told BBC Urdu that the attackers were armed as they charged at the Federal Constabulary's headquarters in Peshawar in north-western Pakistan.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.The constabulary's complex is located in a highly secured area in Peshawar, and the attackers would have had to breach multiple levels of security to break in.Witnesses told local media they heard two loud explosions at around 08:10 local time (03:10 GMT) on Monday. The area has been cordoned off and rescue teams are currently on site. One official said five security officials and seven civilians were injured.Pakistan authorities have described the attack as a \"foiled terrorist plot\", noting that the attackers were gunned down at the gate, before they managed to enter the building.\"The perpetrators of this incident should be identified as soon as possible and brought to justice,\" said Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan's Federal Constabulary, previously known as the Frontier Constabulary, is responsible for handling situations beyond the capabilities of the police force, including tribal incursions and criminal gang violence.Peshawar is part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which sits along the border Afghanistan and has long been a flashpoint for militant violence.The Pakistani Taliban, also known as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, is active in the province and had claimed responsibility for similar attacks across the country.Additional reporting by Kelly Ng",

    "body": "1 hour agoAnnabel Rackham,Culture reporter and Ian Youngs,Culture reporterSenior figures involved in the BBC's recent troubles will be questioned by MPs on Monday.Michael Prescott - a former editorial adviser who raised concerns about BBC reporting, including Panorama's edit of a Donald Trump speech - will speak on the matter in public for the first time when he appears in front of a House of Commons committee.An internal memo written by Prescott was leaked to the press, leading to the resignations of the BBC's director general and head of news earlier this month.Also giving evidence will be BBC chairman Samir Shah, who is under pressure for his handling of the affair, and fellow board members Sir Robbie Gibb and Caroline Thomson.Caroline Daniel, another former editorial adviser, will also speak to parliament's Culture, Media and Sport Committee from 15:30 GMT.They are expected to face tough questions from MPs, and to give their views on the state of the BBC and its journalism, and give their accounts of events behind the scenes. On Friday, one board member, Shumeet Banerji, resigned over what he called \"governance issues\" at the top of the corporation, which BBC media editor Katie Razzall said \"looks like a direct critique of\" Shah.Banerji's departure makes Monday's committee hearing \"even more critical\" for Shah, Razzall added.The role of Sir Robbie, a former BBC senior editor and director of communications for Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, is also expected to come under  scrutiny.BBC director general Tim Davie and CEO of News Deborah Turness resigned following criticism after Prescott's memo was reported by the Telegraph.In a subsequent letter to the parliamentary committee, Shah apologised for the \"error of judgement\" when two sections of Trump's speech on 6 January 2021 were edited together in an episode of Panorama.Prescott's memo also raised concerns about other \"troubling matters\" including \"systemic problems\" of bias in BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Gaza war, and one-sided coverage of trans issues.The committee's chairwoman, Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage, has said Davie's departure was \"regrettable\" but that \"restoring trust in the corporation must come first\".She said: \"The BBC Board must now begin the long process of rebuilding the corporation's reputation both at home and abroad, after the damage caused by what has become a seemingly constant stream of crises and missteps.\"The latest crisis has sparked a wider debate about the future of the BBC and the state of its news output, including claims of institutional bias and political interference.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has said the perception of political influence is \"a problem\", and that there is \"a real concern, which I share, that political appointments to the board of the BBC damaged confidence and trust in the BBC's impartiality\".She pledged to examine the issue as part of the corporation's next charter review.Sir Robbie was appointed to the BBC board by the Conservative government in 2021, and has been accused of interfering in editorial decisions.He sits on the BBC board's editorial guidelines and standards committee (EGSC) alongside Shah, Davie and Thomson, who is the BBC's former chief operating officer.The parliamentary committee said Monday's session would focus on the EGSC's \"processes and how it ensures output complies with the BBC's editorial guidelines\".Prescott, a former Sunday Times political editor, and Daniel, a former FT assistant editor, advised the EGSC about \"editorial risks and issues\" after being appointed as the BBC's first \"external editorial experts\" in 2022.On Sunday, the Guardian reported the BBC was looking to expand the EGSC as part of reforms, which is understood to be accurate.It is possible that having a bigger cast could help it to scrutinise issues better, and ensure no one individual can dominate proceedings.The Guardian also reported the BBC will look to add a new deputy director general role, after concerns that the job is too much for one person. There have been deputy director generals in the corporation previously.The BBC has not commented on the Guardian reports.The session comes as the BBC waits to discover whether Trump will file legal action after threatening to sue the corporation for between $1bn (£759.8m) and $5bn (£3.8bn) over the Panorama edit.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSimon JackBusiness editorReutersBusiness leaders face a nervous final few days before the chancellor's second Budget, having borne the brunt of a brutal set of tax hikes this time last year.Firms are still reeling from those: the £25bn National Insurance increase and an inflation-busting rise in the minimum wage.Confidence in boardrooms has grown increasingly fragile as the Budget nears. Almost all measures of sentiment among chief executives and finance bosses in the last six months have shown alarm bells ringing.So what can nervous business owners and leaders expect from Rachel Reeves?We are certain taxes will rise, and that takes money out of the economy. Research firm Capital Economics estimates the Budget will knock 0.2% off GDP in 2026 – a meaningful hit to an economy that only grew 0.1% in the third quarter of this year.However, as the chancellor pulls money out of the economy, the Bank of England is likely to push money back in by lowering interest rates, encouraging people and businesses to borrow and spend.And, as one senior government adviser told the BBC, that means a lot of the \"big things\" that affect business confidence, including inflation, are expected to fall next year. I would expect the chancellor to accentuate those positives.When it comes to business, the government will in part want to be judged on what it does not do in this Budget: no more nasty surprises, no blanket tax rises.PA MediaBudget ingredientsSo what might be in the mix?Business rates are a bug-bear. Many firms have seen their bills almost double, after a pandemic-era discount of 75% for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses was cut to 40% last year.The chancellor has previously promised reform. She could make the existing discounts permanent and remove cliff edges that see small businesses' rates bills shoot up when they expand. That could be partly paid for by increasing rates on the largest retail properties.On Monday Business Secretary Peter Kyle will address the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) conference, and will have a couple of business-friendly policies to announce, including a consultation on how to lower energy bills for 7,000 businesses and a command to the British Business Bank to focus its lending on the eight \"high potential\" sectors identified in the industrial strategy.The chancellor is also likely to point to the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill, a piece of legislation that she has described as \"probably the biggest thing we will do this parliament\", as a way of removing barriers to growth.Bank profits are a tempting target and there have been mixed messages on whether she might hike taxes there. But ministers are concerned it does not fit the pro-growth, pro-investment narrative. It is possible that the Treasury will reduce payments to the Bank of England that cover their losses on the sales of government bonds that were bought to support the economy during the pandemic and financial crisis. That in turn reduces payments to commercial banks and would be seen by them as a bank tax in all but name.The oil and gas industry has lobbied hard for some respite on the \"windfall\" taxes on their profits, arguing that, with oil prices low, there is no windfall profit to tax. They say investment in the North Sea is shrivelling fast, with knock-on effects in refinery and chemical plant closures. Firms say relief could preserve jobs.The additional 38% tax, which is on top of a 40% tax rate specific to the industry, is due to expire in 2030. There is a chance it could be phased out earlier.Getty ImagesAmong bosses there is still concern over the government's flagship Employment Rights Bill, which promises sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal for new workers from day one. Rain Newton-Smith, head of the CBI, will use her speech on Monday to call for the government to change course, saying the policy deters hiring. There is no sign the government is backing off, but Kyle recently told a committee of MPs that there were 26 consultations to come on exactly how these measures will be implemented.The chancellor is also expected to speak about consumers having the \"confidence to spend\".Some in the business community will interpret this as possibly heralding another higher-than-inflation rise in the national living wage, which also tends to push up other salaries in a firm's wage structure.One other policy that will hit both employers and employees is a cap on salary sacrifice schemes which allow workers to put some of their pre-tax earnings into their pension pots.Such schemes are widely used in larger companies and there is concern that cutting them will mean less generous workplace pensions in the years to come. Restoring faithWhat the government wants business to hear is that it is on their side, that it knows a lot was asked of them last time, and that this time they are being spared, even helped at the margin where possible.After months of anxious waiting business may then breathe a collective sigh of relief.According to a recent survey by Barclays, 55% of business leaders say they are delaying investment decisions until they have seen the Budget. But 43% say they expect to increase investment after it, a sign of possible pent-up optimism.But confidence is still very fragile. The chancellor will need to handle with care.",

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.Wilson ChiloA fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas CalientesBack in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly. Consettur is made up of 12 different companies with various partners.\"These partners include the local district council, which owns 38% of Consettur.Meanwhile, San Antonio de Torontoy is based slightly further away in the wider Urubamba Province.AFP via Getty ImagesUnless you fancy a long hike, the only way to get to the town of Aguas Calientes is by trainAs the row and legal dispute over the buses rumbles on, Australian tourist Annalise Jaksic complains about the cost of the trains to Aguas Calientes. The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals. The Ministry of Culture was asked for a comment.Wilson ChiloCristian Alberto Caballero Chacón says Consettur would welcome the competitionOutside on one of the side streets that are full of stalls offering tourism souvenirs, like fluffy alpacas and scarves, Dina Huillca is sitting on the pavement selling roses, tomatoes and mint. She travels from her village to get here, and says that \"more needs to be done for the local communities\".She adds: \"We don't have basic services like running water, or a hospital, and the schools need to be in better condition.\"Carlos González is president of the chamber of tourism for this region of Peru, the Department of Cusco. He has an ambitious desire to see the state control of all public transport in Peru.\"We are pushing for an update in the law so that the vice ministry of tourism can take care of all the travel resources in our country,\" he says. \"If we don't have a unified approach to Peru as a destination we can't be competitive in the long term.\"He also wants to change tourists' experiences in Machu Picchu, with more entrances, and separate areas where different types of visitors can gather.\"[Such as] spiritual travellers going and having meditative rituals in one area,\" says Mr Gonzalez. \"And let's not forget the younger crowd who are more inclined to do their Tik Toks and their stories for Instagram. They also need a place for doing that and enjoying themselves in a young fashion.\"But he says that Peru's unstable national governments make change difficult. The country has had six different presidents in the past six years.\"I've been a leader of the tourism sector for five years now, and I have lost count of how many ministers, vice ministers and congress people I have spoken to.\"Back in Aguas Calientes, Mr Caballero says he'd be happy to see both Consettur and San Antonio de Toronto run buses to and from Machu Picchu.\"If they are given the final approval we don't have a problem with working with them. We won't stop them.\"Read more global business and tech stories",

    "body": "8 hours agoBen KingBusiness reporterThe third stage of the Covid-19 Inquiry begins hearing evidence on Monday focusing on the measures taken to support workers' incomes and keep businesses afloat when the pandemic struck.It will focus on what action the UK government, devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and local authorities took, how well schemes were designed and what was done to minimise fraud and waste.According to the Treasury £140bn was spent on support for businesses, much of it going to pay people's wages when they were forced to stay at home.Last week the report on the second phase of the inquiry, into political decision-making, found the government had done \"too little, too late\".The Covid Inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, is expected to look at ten areas in total, and provide lessons for managing future pandemics.What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?This next module, expected to last until just before Christmas, will examine the unprecedented economic intervention rolled out when the first lockdown was announced in March 2020.The largest scheme, the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, known as furlough, covered 11.7 million jobs between March 2020 and September 2021, at a cost of £70bn, paying a portion of employees' wages to ensure they still had an income even if they could not go to work, and to keep businesses going so that they could reopen later.There was also a support scheme for self-employed people, loan schemes for businesses and business rates relief.At the time there was widespread praise for the prompt roll-out of support, especially in the travel and hospitality sectors where businesses were shuttered overnight. But questions were also raised over the scale of the programme, the strength of safeguards against fraud and error, and whether it delayed people taking up new work roles.This phase of the inquiry will also look at the additional funding provided for public services such as the railways to keep them running during lockdowns, and support for the voluntary and community sector.It will examine decisions on benefits, sick pay and support for vulnerable people.However, this part of the inquiry will not look at how the pandemic affected the economy as a whole.Baroness Coffey, the former work and pensions secretary, is due to appear on Wednesday, as well as Will Quince, the former welfare delivery minister.The first item on Monday will be an impact film featuring personal testimony from people affected, and opening submissions from lawyers for the inquiry itself and core participants. Labour market expert Mike Brewer, one of five experts commissioned to write reports on different aspects of the governments' economic policy response, will be the first witness to give evidence on Tuesday morning. Also appearing are: Former Treasury officials James Benford and Dan York-SmithRepresentatives of the charities Child Poverty Action Group, Long Covid Support and Disability UKFormer Downing Street special adviser Ben WarnerFormer director general for analysis of the Covid-19 Taskforce, Robert Harrison.Rishi Sunak, who was chancellor of the exchequer during the pandemic, has confirmed that he will appear in a couple of weeks' time.On Friday, he told Matt Chorley's programme on BBC Radio 5 Live that the government and scientific community were \"operating in a highly uncertain environment\". \"I think we do need to view the decisions taken through that lens. \"But it's important that lessons [are] learned so that we can be better prepared if there's ever another pandemic.\"Last week the inquiry published a highly critical report on core decision-making during the pandemic, which described a \"toxic and chaotic\" culture at the centre of the UK government.Michael Gove, who was a cabinet minister at the time, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted to \"apologise to all those who lost loved ones during the pandemic - and to many others who made huge sacrifices\".The public hearings for this section of the inquiry – known as Module 9 – are scheduled to run for four weeks, ending on 18 December.",

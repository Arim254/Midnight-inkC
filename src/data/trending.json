    "body": "The Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics have officially ended following the closing ceremony in northern Italy.It took place at Verona Olympic Arena, despite none of the sporting events happening in the city, which is 75 miles from Milan.After beginning with a tribute to classic Italian opera, flagbearers representing the 92 competing nations entered the stadium through large props from Aida and accompanied by a tribute to Italian film music.The 'Drop of Fire' – the Olympic flame carried in a small glass vessel – was brought into the ancient arena to light up the rings before the parade of athletes.While athletes are supposed to come in all mixed together, here they were still largely in national groups.The final medals from Milan-Cortina 2026 were awarded in the women's and men's 50km mass start cross-country skiing events, before a tribute to the Games volunteers.The ceremony finished with performances from popular Italian musicians Major Lazer and singer-songwriter Achille Lauro.In her speech to close the Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Kirsty Coventry said: \"You have been incredible – every one of you. Brave. Fearless. Full of heart and passion. You left it all on the snow and ice.\"Two unforgettable weeks, living every moment to the fullest. You gave everything – and you shared it with all of us.\"This is the true Olympic spirit: competing, embracing, lifting each other up, whatever the result. You showed us what excellence, respect, and friendship look like in a world that sometimes forgets these values.\"You showed us that the Olympic Games are a place for everyone. A place where sport brings us together.\"It ended a Games which saw 116 medal events, and historic sporting success for several of the competing nations – including Great Britain.Team GB won five medals, including three golds, to finish 15th in the table. Britain has never previously won more than one gold at a Games before.Matt Weston, the male flagbearer, won two golds in skeleton – the men's event and the team competition with Tabby Stoeker.The female GB flagbearer was Charlotte Bankes, who won gold in the team snowboard cross with Huw Nightingale; it was the first Olympic event on snow won by British athletes.Team GB also won silver in the men's curling, while Zoe Atkin claimed bronze in women's ski halfpipe on the final day.Brazil's Lucas Pinheiro Braathen took the men's giant slalom title to register a first Winter Olympic gold won by a South American nation.Georgia earned their first Winter Olympic medal with silver in pairs figure skating, while Spain collected their first gold medal for 54 years in the men's ski mountaineering. Benin, Guinea-Bissau and United Arab Emirates competed in their first Winter Games.For hosts Italy, Milan-Cortina marked their best Winter Games with 10 golds among 30 medals to put them fourth in the table.Norway topped the medals table for the fourth successive Games. They collected 18 medals, including six for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo, the king of cross-country skiing.Had Klaebo, who set a record for the most golds won by an individual athlete at a single Games, competed as a nation on his own, he would have been ninth in the medal table. Fittingly, his sixth gold - in the men's 50km cross-country skiing - was presented at the closing ceremony as the final medal awarded at the Games.The oldest individual medallist was Elana Meyers Taylor of the United States, who broke the Games record by winning monobob gold, aged 41.Skiing great Lindsey Vonn saw her Olympic career end with a broken leg.The Games also had controversial moments.Ukraine's Vladyslav Heraskevych wished to compete in the men's skeleton while wearing a remembrance helmet featuring artwork depicting athletes killed during the Russian invasion of his country.But the IOC said this contravened Games rules and, after Heraskevych refused to back down, disqualified him from competing.There was also a silver medal, in men's ski mountaineering, for Russian athlete Nikita Filippov. He competed as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) because Russia were banned from the Games because of their aggression in Ukraine.Filippov, along with other AIN competitors, was allowed to take part in the closing ceremony having been banned from the opening event.Men's curling gold medallists Canada had their campaign dogged by allegations of cheating.The ceremony included the handover of the Olympic flag to the delegation representing the French Alps, which will host the next Winter Games in 2030.The presidents of the two French regions to host the Games, Renaud Muselier and Fabrice Pannekoucke, enthusiastically accepted the flag from Coventry.There was a performance of the sixth verse of La Marseillaise, the French national anthem, as it was deemed to be more universal and less patriotic. The arrangement changed throughout into a more contemporary style with an electronic base.As well as a video showcasing the Alps, there was also a performance by 25 musicians and 24 athletes – the first time Olympians have featured in the artistic elements of the closing ceremony.",

He is also the patron saint of animals and the environment.The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226.The late Pope Francis, who died last year after leading the Roman Catholic Church for more than a decade, chose his name and modelled his papacy after the radical humility of Saint Francis.St Francis of Assisi's bones will be on display until 22 March.

    "body": "William 'not calm, but carrying on' after Andrew arrest and a Bafta for Buckley30 minutes agoThe fallout from Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest continues to dominate Monday's papers. The Daily Mail leads with the Prince of Wales' comments as he attended the Bafta awards on Sunday, where he was asked whether he had seen the film Hamnet: \"I need to be in quite a calm state and I am not at the moment - I will save it.\" The paper says Prince William's appearance at the ceremony with Catherine, the Princess of Wales \"signalled a determination to put the Royal Family's difficulties to one side\".\"William: I need to calm down\" the Daily Mirror echoes as it fills its front page with Prince William and Catherine arriving at the Baftas. The event marks the Royal couple's first public appearance since Andrew's arrest. The paper adds that Prince William is understood to be \"making plans to restore public trust in the monarchy\" amid the scandal. The Sun follows with the same picture of Prince William and Catherine with the caption: \"Not calm, but he's carrying on.\"The Daily Star says the Royal Family is facing a \"crisis\" as the investigation continues and police try to gain access to files kept at Buckingham Palace. The King has reportedly told his staff to give police access to his own files as they investigate Andrew's ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Metro. \"Access all areas\" is the headline. Andrew has consistently denied any wrongdoing.Staying with Jeffrey Epstein, the Daily Telegraph reports that the late sex offender hid computers and photographs from US authorities in secret storage lockers across America. The paper cites documents that show Epstein paid private detectives to remove equipment from his Florida home in an \"apparent attempt to prevent investigators from finding it\".According to the Times, the Metropolitan Police started re-examining trafficking allegations related to Jeffrey Epstein, but investigators have been told that some of the evidence has been destroyed. Moving to news closer to home, the Guardian says ministers will reveal a \"generational\" overhaul of special educational needs support on Monday, pledging a £4bn package. Elsewhere, the top picture spot is taken by Bafta best actress winner Jesse Buckley, who called the award \"an incredible honour\".Jesse Buckley's \"triumph\" at the Baftas also leads the Independent's front page. Alongside, the paper reveals Apple AirTags and small tracking devices are being \"weaponised\" by stalkers, forcing some victims to flee their homes and change jobs.The i Paper shifts its focus to Peter Mandelson, reporting that the government \"fast-tracked\" security vetting for the former ambassador to the US despite knowing about his links to Epstein. However, the government says it was normal to prioritise vetting and any suggestion that part of the process was missed is \"false\".The Daily Express says it has seen documents from Sir Keir Starmer's time as top prosecutor that show he oversaw the use of \"paedophile Asbos\" that let suspects off with warnings.Finally, the Financial Times reports that Iran agreed to a secret €500m arms deal with Russia to acquire thousands of advanced missiles in an attempt to rebuild is air defences in its war with Israel last year.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "3 hours agoGeorge WrightGetty ImagesAn armed man has been shot dead after entering the secure perimeter of US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, the Secret Service has said.The man was carrying a shotgun and fuel can when he was stopped and shot by Secret Service agents and a Sheriff's deputy, authorities said.The incident happened around 01:30 ET (06:30 GMT) on Sunday morning, when the president was in Washington DC. The suspect has been named as Austin T Martin of Cameron, North Carolina, according to the BBC's US partner CBS.His family in North Carolina had reported him missing in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Moore County Sheriff's Office said in a statement to the BBC. The missing persons information has since been turned over to federal authorities, the sheriff's office said.They added that the department had no prior history involving Martin and it was not involved in the Florida investigation.Officials are looking into whether he bought the gun along the driving route he took from North Carolina to Florida, according to CBS.Secret Service agents fired at him after they saw him \"unlawfully entering the secure perimeter at Mar-a-Lago early this morning\", agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi posted on X.The suspect \"was observed by the north gate of the Mar-a-Lago property carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel can\", the agency said in a statement.The man was then shot after refusing orders, Palm Beach County sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\"The only words that we said to him was 'drop the items' which means the gas can and the shotgun,\" Bradshaw told a news conference. \"At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,\" he said. At that point, agents fired their weapons to \"neutralise the threat\", he said.FacebookThe suspect had been reported missing by relatives, according to CBSThe officers were wearing body cameras and no law enforcement officers were injured, he added.Bradshaw said that he does not know if the suspect's gun was loaded, and that will form part of an investigation, which the FBI will be assisting in.US Secret Service Director Sean Curran travelled to Florida on Sunday for \"after-actions\" and has \"reinvigorated operational communication and agency response to critical incidents\", the agency said in a post on X. Security at Mar-a-Lago is extremely tight, with an outer cordon of local Palm Beach sheriffs and an inner one maintained by the Secret Service. Visitors are searched, and cars and bags are swept by dogs and metal detectors.Trump has been the target of several assassination plots or attempts.In July 2024, Trump was shot in the ear as he stood in front of crowds in Butler, Pennsylvania. One bystander was killed and two were injured in the shooting. The shooter, 20-year-old Matthew Crooks, was immediately shot and killed by security forces and his motive remains unknown.Months later, a US Secret Service agent spotted a rifle sticking out of bushes at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The man, later identified as Ryan Routh, fled but was caught. The 59-year-old was sentenced to life in prison earlier this month for attempting to assassinate the president.During an appearance on Fox Business after the fatal incident, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blamed the the political left for \"normalising\" political violence,  citing the two attempts on Trump's life in 2024,\"Two would-be assassins dead, one in jail for life, and this venom coming from the other side,\" Bessent said, adding: \"They are normalising this violence. It's got to stop.\"",

    "body": "3 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterGetty ImagesThe government says it will spend billions to make mainstream schools in England more inclusive for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).That includes £1.6bn over three years going directly to schools, early years settings and colleges, and £1.8bn over the same period to provide more access to experts such as specialist teachers and speech and language therapists.The new money is part of a major SEND system overhaul, with government plans for a series of school reforms due to be published in full on Monday.Teaching unions said they would be scrutinising the proposals closely, with one saying the money was \"barely a drop in the bucket\" of what was needed because of \"years of underfunding\".That included plans to reassess children's education, health and care plans (EHCPs) - the legal documents setting out what support they are entitled to - after they leave primary school, and again after GCSEs.That change could lead to fewer children retaining their EHCPs, which are an expensive part of the SEND system, into secondary school. Children in Year 6 in 2029 would be the first to be reviewed under the plans, ahead of starting secondary school in 2030.Disability charities and campaign groups said that would raise concerns among parents, worried that support could be withdrawn at a time when \"stability is critical\".The leaked plans also included proposals for new individual support plans (ISPs) for all children with SEND, which would have some level of legal backing.Currently, just over 480,000 of the 1.7 million pupils with SEND in England have EHCPs.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson: \"We are not going to be taking away effective support for children\"Responding to the announcement of more money targeted towards making mainstream schools more inclusive, Matt Wrack, general secretary of the union NASUWT, said: \"£1.6bn over three years may sound like a lot of money, but it equates to just a few thousand pounds per setting.\"He said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest the system could be overhauled with that amount of funding.Luke Sibieta, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, described the new funding, which is being allocated to SEND from within the Department for Education's budget, as a \"reasonably significant change\".But he said reform would be a \"long and complicated process\", adding that a new funding system would need to be developed \"to ensure resources are targeted across schools to where they are needed\".The government will need to manage that transition carefully to minimise any disruption to existing support for pupils with SEND, he said.Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the changes would mean families get \"tailored support built around their child's individual needs, available on their doorstep\".\"Whatever their background, wherever they live - this government will do right by every child,\" he added.Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the reforms would be a \"watershed moment\" for children, and a \"major milestone in this government's mission to make sure opportunity is for each and every child\".Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, she said ministers would not be withdrawing \"effective support\", and stressed that the government would be \"spending more money\", not less, on providing for children with SEND.The National Association of Head Teachers welcomed the \"principle\" of more funding to help support pupils in mainstream schools, but said it would be speaking to school leaders \"to weigh up whether it is sufficient\".\"There will always be some pupils whose needs are so great that they require support in a special school, and it's crucial the government's plans ensure all children get the support they need at the right time in the right setting,\" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the union, said.Jon Sparkes, chief executive of learning disability charity Mencap, said the extra funding for more inclusive mainstream schools was \"welcome news\".\"Families must have their children's needs identified early and for them to be given the right help straight away, backed by services fully funded to do the job, and rights underpinned by law,\" she said.Part of the new funding also includes £200m to make every teacher qualified to support pupils with SEND, in what the government called the biggest SEND training offer ever seen in English schools.Kate McGough / BBCHead teacher Claire Robertson says SEND inclusion is about more than just one-to-one support time, and should include lesson planning and classroom designMore teacher training around SEND is something many school leaders have been hoping to see in the government's reforms.Claire Robertson, head teacher of Cherry Fields Primary School in Banbury, said mainstream schools like hers \"have a duty to be as inclusive as we can\".Speaking to BBC News before the latest funding announcement, she said she hoped the White Paper would have a particular focus on developing SEND training for mainstream staff.\"Our staff are wonderful but we need to have access to appropriate training to support our young people,\" she said.Under its proposed reforms, the government said it is also planning to halve the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers in England by the time children born in this Parliament finish secondary school.Full details of all of the government's planned reforms for schools will be published on Monday.",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykGetty ImagesThe US operates two dedicated hospital boats, including the USNS Mercy Greenland's prime minister has asked US President Donald Trump to talk to him instead of making \"random outbursts on social media\", after Trump said he was sending a US hospital boat to \"take care\" of people on the island.Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was going to send a boat filled with medical supplies, alleging \"many people\" on the island are sick and \"not being taken care of\".Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded \"it's going to be a no thanks from us,\" and said that Greenland provides free healthcare for all citizens, unlike the US. Trump has long coveted the vast arctic island - but conceded in January that he would not take it by force, after previously refusing to rule out doing so. He later announced a \"framework for a future deal\" around the US and Greenland, after Denmark and Nato allies made it clear that they would not give in to his calls to relinquish sovereignty.In his post on social media, Trump said that he and his Greenland envoy Jeff Landry were \"going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there. It's on the way!!!\"The post included what appeared to be an illustrated or AI image of the USNS Mercy, one of two hospital ships operated by the US navy. It is not clear if Trump was referencing either of those ships, or what had prompted his decision. Responding to the post, Nielsen said that Trump's idea \"is noted. But we have a public healthcare system where treatment is free for citizens.\"\"It's not like that in the United States, where it costs money to go to the doctor,\" he wrote on Facebook.Nielsen added that Greenland remained open to cooperating with the US but underlined the importance of discussing issues directly.\"Talk to us instead of just making more or less random outbursts on social media,\" he said.Trump's post came soon after Denmark's Joint Arctic Command said it had evacuated a crew member who required urgent medical treatment from a US submarine close to Nuuk. It is not clear if Trump's post was related to the incident.A month on from Trump announcing a \"framework for a future deal\" over Greenland, details are still unclear, though earlier this month US vice president JD Vance alleged that European countries were \"willing to make a lot of accommodations\".",

    "body": "10 hours agoEd CampbellBBC News InvestigationsGetty ImagesGordon Brown has demanded a police investigation into whether Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor used taxpayer-funded jets and RAF bases to meet the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, according to reports.The former prime minister wrote letters to six police forces suggesting that civil servants be questioned about Andrew's time as UK trade envoy, the Sunday Telegraph says.Andrew was an envoy from 2001 to 2011, including almost three years when Brown was in No 10.The paper also reports that Brown has demanded a full investigation into the trade envoy role, its cost to taxpayers and any evidence that links the former prince's government work to late financier Epstein.Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, who died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Brown told the BBC last week that he had \"submitted a five-page memorandum to the Metropolitan, Surrey, Sussex, Thames Valley and other relevant UK police constabularies\".He said: \"This memorandum provides new and additional information to that which I submitted last week to the Met, Essex and Thames Valley police forces where I expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women.\"When asked about these flights by the BBC in October 2025, the Ministry of Defence said \"it is standard practice for spare capacity at RAF airfields in the UK to be used for private or commercial aircraft, subject to fees which cover all costs\".It added that such use \"is not automatic and will only be approved when there is no adverse impact to military aircraft and where approval would not interfere with the security or smooth running of the airfield\". The MoD repeated this response when asked by the BBC again on Sunday.In an email message, Jon Swain asks if Andrew had secured permission for Epstein to use military bases. The question is forwarded to Epstein by Ghislaine Maxwell - who in 2021 was convicted in the US for her role in luring underage girls for him.Epstein responds to say, \"just spoke to Larry… it's true\". The man named Larry was Epstein's chief pilot, who arranged many of his landings and logistics. Maxwell then responds using an expletive.The Sunday Telegraph says Brown is requesting that police examine whether Epstein was given access to RAF bases after his conviction for soliciting child prostitution in Florida in 2008.Andrew was arrested by Thames Valley Police on Thursday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office, and released under investigation 11 hours later.He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment on specific allegations that have emerged after the US release of files connected to the late financier's case - including claims he shared information with Epstein while trade envoy.Searches are continuing this weekend at his former Windsor mansion Royal Lodge, where he lived for many years.",

    "body": "Rory McIlroy shot a four-under-par 67 but it was not enough to overhaul winner Jacob Bridgeman, who won by one shot at the Genesis Invitational in Los Angeles.Northern Ireland's McIlroy started the day six shots off the lead but despite making five birdies he could not catch American Bridgeman, who got over the line with a one-over-par 72 to finish on 18 under.Bridgeman, who held a seven-shot lead early in the day, held back tears on the 18th green before sinking a three-foot putt for his first PGA Tour title.He is also the first man to win the prestigious event in his tournament debut since 1975.Bridgeman's victory continues his good start to the year having had two top-10 finishes in his opening four events, including last week's eighth place at Pebble Beach.The 26-year-old's three bogies on the final day at the Riviera Country Club gave the chasing players hope, including countryman Kurt Kitayama, who finished tied for second with McIlroy on 17 under after carding a seven-under-par 64.World number two McIlroy was even par after the first nine holes, but made four birdies on the back nine, including a brilliant hole-out from the greenside bunker on the 12th, to put pressure on Bridgeman.A nervy closing three holes saw Bridgeman bogey 16 then leave his putt on 18 over three feet short, after McIlroy had drained a 30 footer to get within a shot, to ensure a tense final stroke in front of tournament host Tiger Woods.Bridgeman held his nerve though to claim a first PGA Tour title in style, with victory at one of the Signature Events moving him inside the top 25 of the world rankings for the first time.England's Tommy Fleetwood shot a four-under-par 67 to finish joint-seventh on 12-under, which included a slam dunk eagle with his approach shot on 15 from 173 yards out.World number one Scottie Scheffler made a flying finish with his 65 seeing him recover from his bad start on Thursday to finish in joint 12th.That meant an end to Scheffler's brilliant run of 18 consecutive top-10 finishes on the PGA Tour. England's Marco Penge, who was the joint-leader alongside Bridgeman after the second round, ended in tied for 16th place on 10 under.Max Greyserman provided another big highlight of the day as he made a hole-in-one at the 14th, which illuminated an otherwise difficult day for him as he made four bogeys and a double bogey in his 73.",

The devices were planted in waste bins, it added.President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed \"an individual suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack\" had been detained. Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said she was a Ukrainian woman.The police later said the 33-year-old suspect had made and planted the explosives on the \"instruction\" of an agent of Russia's special services.The victim of the attack was named as Viktoria Shpylka. \"She was only 23 years old and had begun her service at the start of the full-scale invasion of the Kherson region,\" the police wrote on Telegram on Sunday morning.National Police of UkrainePolice officer Viktoria Shpylka was killed in the attackPolice said the first blast occurred after a police car arrived at the scene of the reported break-in at a shop in the city centre.\"Later, when a second crew arrived, another explosion went off,\" it added.Eleven people were admitted to hospital, six of whom were law enforcement officers in serious conditions.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said police and the Security Service of Ukraine had detained the suspect, a resident of the north-western Rivne region.\"We are identifying other persons involved in committing this crime,\" he wrote on Telegram.Meanwhile, the regional prosecutor's office said it had started an investigation into the \"act of terrorism that led to grave consequences\".National Police of Ukraine/TelegramA number of officials were also injured after bombs detonated when they arrived to a reported break-in overnightElsewhere, Ukraine faced another night of overnight Russian strikes ahead of the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on Tuesday.Kyiv said its air defences had countered 50 Russian missiles and nearly 300 drones overnight. The attacks targeted the energy sector, residential buildings, and railways, Zelensky said.At least one person was killed in the Kyiv region, top local official Mykola Kalashnyk said, while a woman and a child were taken to hospital with injuries.The latest aerial attack comes two days before the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The invasion ordered by President Vladimir Putin has become the biggest war in Europe since World War Two, with hundreds of thousands of military casualties -killed, wounded and missing - believed to be on each side.Western military experts estimate that Russian combat losses have been much higher than Ukraine's.Moscow currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula it annexed in 2014.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoWill Grant,Mexico correspondentandJack BurgessReutersNemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as 'El Mencho', was leader of the Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartelMexico's most wanted man and the leader of the feared Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) drug cartel has been killed during a security operation to arrest him, the  defence ministry has said.Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as \"El Mencho\", died on Sunday as he was being taken to the capital Mexico City, after being seriously injured in clashes between his supporters and the army.Four CJNG members were killed in the town of Tapalpa, the central-western Jalisco state. Three army personnel were also injured. The US had given Mexico information that assisted the operation.CJNG retaliated by setting cars alight, building roadblocks and attacking security forces in eight states.The US State Department issued a shelter-in-place warning for US citizens in the states of Jalisco, Tamaulipas, as well as some areas in Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo later urged people to remain \"calm\".In a post on X, she wrote that \"in most parts of the country, activities are proceeding normally\".El Mencho, a 59-year-old former police officer, ran a vast criminal organisation responsible for trafficking huge quantities of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the US.The US State Department had offered a $15m (£11.1m) reward for information leading to El Mencho's capture.In a statement, the Mexican defence ministry said the operation was \"planned and executed\" by the country's special forces.Aircraft from the Mexican Air Force and the National Guard were also deployed.It also said that several armoured vehicles and weapons - including rocket launchers - were seized during the operation.The US had been providing information to Mexico that assisted its operation, the statement said. ReutersA burning bus that appears to have been used as a roadblock by organised crime during the Mexican military's move against El MenchoEyewitnesses have filmed plumes of smoke rising over several cities including Guadalajara - one of the host cities of the forthcoming Fifa World Cup. In the tourist hotspot of Puerto Vallarta, on the Jalisco coast, potentially thousands of tourists are trapped in the resort because of the unrest.Throughout Sunday, there were reports of gunmen on the streets in Jalisco and elsewhere.The governor of Jalisco, Pablo Lemus Navarro, on social media advised residents of the state to adhere to a code red warning and stay in their homes.He also said that public transport was suspended in the state.US carriers United Airlines and American Airlines, as well as Air Canada, have cancelled flights to Puerto Vallarta and Guadalajara. A flight operated by Delta Airlines bound for Guadalajara from Atlanta was diverted to Austin, according to flight-tracking site Flight Aware.Former US ambassador to Mexico and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau described El Mencho on social media as \"one of the bloodiest and most ruthless drug kingpins.\"He added that El Mencho's death was \"a great development for Mexico, the US, Latin America, and the world\". Mike Vigil, former Chief of International Operations for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, described the operation as \"one of the most significant actions undertaken in the history of drug trafficking\". He was speaking to CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The killing of El Mencho represents a victory for the Mexican president in her fight against the country's drug cartels.It also could strengthen her relationship with US President  Donald Trump, who has threatened to target the cartels on Mexican soil.Last January, Trump told Fox News that after targeting drug trafficking boats \"we are going to start now hitting land,\" adding that \"the cartels are running Mexico\".President Sheinbaum later responded by saying a US troop deployment across the southern border was \"not on the table\".However, if the security forces can't bring the situation under control quickly, the Mexican administration's victory may be overshadowed by the cartel's violent response.The Jalisco cartel has gained notoriety for a series of attacks on security forces and public officials.It has downed an army helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade, killed dozens of state officials, and has even been known to hang the bodies of its victims from bridges to intimidate its rivals.CJNG cartel - Mexico's major drug trafficking playerThe CJNG cartel - which had its original power base in Jalisco in 2010 - is now present across Mexico.The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers it to be rivalling the powerful Sinaloa cartel, which has a presence in all 50 US states. CJNG is also a key supplier of drugs to the US, earning billions from fentanyl production.Most fentanyl enters US via MexicoSince October 2024, 9,200lb (4,182kg) of fentanyl has been seized in the US, according to figures published by US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) in June 2025.Almost all (96%) was intercepted at the south-west border with Mexico. Less than 1% was seized across the northern US border with Canada. The remainder was from sea routes or other US checkpoints.",

    "body": "7 hours agoJaroslav LukivandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianReutersThe US has been building up its military presence near Iran in recent weeksUS President Donald Trump is questioning why Iran has not yet \"capitulated\" in the face of Washington's military build-up in the Middle East, the US president's special envoy Steve Witkoff has said.Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Trump was \"curious\" about Iran's position after he had warned of a limited military strike if a deal was not reached on Tehran's nuclear programme.The US and its European allies suspect Iran of moving towards making a nuclear weapon, which it denies. Within Iran, anti-government protests were staged at several universities over the weekend - the first rallies on such a scale since January's deadly crackdown by the authorities, which saw thousands killed. In his interview with Fox News, Witkoff said: \"I don't want to use the word 'frustrated'... because he [Trump] understands he's got plenty of alternatives, but he's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated', but why they haven't capitulated.\"\"Why, under this sort of pressure, with the amount of sea power and naval power that we have over there, why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess that we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do?'\"\"And yet it's hard to sort of get them to that place,\" Trump's envoy added.Getty ImagesSteve Witkoff was the lead US negotiator during indirect talks with Iran in Switzerland on TuesdayIran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Sunday he believed there was still a chance the dispute could be solved diplomatically \"based on a win-win game\". He told CBS News negotiators were working on the elements of a deal.In separate comments two days ago, Araghchi said Tehran was preparing \"a draft of a possible agreement\" and would hand it over to Witkoff in the next few days.US and Iranian officials discussed Iran's nuclear programme at indirect talks in Geneva, Switzerland, on 17 February. They said afterwards that progress had been made.Oman - who mediated the talks - announced on Sunday that the next round of negotiations was now \"set for Geneva this Thursday\".In a post on X, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also expressed hopes that there would be \"a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal\".The US and Iran have not commented.Despite the reported progress in Geneva, Trump said on Thursday that the world would find out \"over the next, probably, 10 days\" whether a deal with Iran would be reached or the US would take military action.In recent weeks, the US has been building up its military presence near Iran and in the wider Middle East region.The deployment includes the world's largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier has also been deployed, along with destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.Scuffles break out at Sharif University in Tehran on SaturdayIn Iran, the BBC has verified footage of demonstrators marching on the campus of the Sharif University of Technology in the capital Tehran on Saturday. They were later seen scuffling with government supporters.Protests were also reported at other universities in Tehran and elsewhere.Iranian media reported demonstrations also took place on Sunday at the Iran University of Science and Technology and Khajeh Nasir Toosi University in Tehran, and at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in north-eastern Iran.In one video the BBC has verified, anti-government protesters raise the Lion and Sun flag - a symbol of Iran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution - at the Sharif University. People in the crowd chant \"Javid Shah\" (\"long live the king\").Another verified video shows a pro-government crowd holding a counter-protest at the Sharif University in which US and Israeli flags are being burned.Clashes between pro and anti-government crowds are also seen in verified footage filmed at Amirkabir University of Technology.Students from different universities have been gathering to honour thousands of those killed by authorities last month.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) said it had confirmed the killing of at least 7,015 people during that wave, including 6,508 protesters, 226 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. The latest figures were updated on 15 February.Hrana also said it was investigating 11,744 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said late last month that more than 3,100 people had been killed - but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".President Trump has supported protesters in the past - at one stage appearing to encourage them with a promise that \"help is on its way\".Additional reporting by BBC Verify's Emma Pengelly",

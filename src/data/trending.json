    "body": "11 hours agoVitaliy ShevchenkoRussia editor, BBC MonitoringThe much-anticipated talks lasted two-and-a-half hours, and that's an achievement in itself. Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.Trump says progress made in Ukraine talks but 'thorny issues' remainThere is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.",

    "body": "1 hour agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterPothole compensation claims made to councils in Britain rose by 90% between 2021 and 2024, according to analysis by the RAC motoring group.The study also found that only a quarter of claims made by motorists in 2024 resulted in payouts.However, the RAC noted that the number of claims fell in 2024 compared with the year before.The Local Government Association (LGA) said \"ever-increasing pressure\" on budgets was affecting councils' abilities to fix roads, while the Department for Transport said the government was spending £7.3bn over the next four years on improving road surfaces.Potholes have become a major bugbear for many drivers. Repair bills can be costly, and they can also cause injuries to passengers, cyclists or pedestrians.The RAC said data it had analysed indicated that 53,015 compensation claims claims were made to 177 local authorities in 2024.That was up from 27,731 in 2021, although it marked a fall from the 56,655 seen in 2023.In 2024, just 26% of claims led to a payout, with an average sum of £390 given to claimants.The RAC estimates that a typical repair bill for a family car with damage worse than a puncture from a pothole is £590.Potholes can cause damage to shock absorbers and suspension springs, and can also distort wheels.RAC head of policy Simon Williams told the BBC: \"It does seem that councils have a variety of different criteria for what they class as a pothole.\"Often they have to be four centimetres deep and so many centimetres wide.\"If you hit one, it can cause a real jolt to the car and serious damage... not just damage to vehicles, it's also a serious road safety danger, particularly on two wheels.\"RAC asked 207 councils about pothole compensation claims. Of the 177 that responded, Derbyshire County Council saw the biggest increase in claims over the three-year period, from 224 to 3,307.However, Derbyshire councillor Charlotte Hill, the council's cabinet member for potholes, highways and transport, said claims had fallen by 72% since May 2025.\"Going forward, Derbyshire highways can become more proactive rather than reactive, and work to make repairs before they become an issue for residents,\" she told the BBC.Glasgow City Council and Oxfordshire County Council saw the next biggest increases between 2021 and 2024.In a statement, Andrew Gant, Oxfordshire County Council's cabinet member for transport management, said the emphasis \"should be on maintenance work to prevent potholes forming in the first place, which is much more cost-effective than repairing them afterwards\".\"That is why we have invested nearly £14.5m since 2024 on the largest surface dressing programmes we have carried out for at least 20 years.\"Surface dressing is a preservation treatment aimed at avoiding potholes forming.The BBC has contacted Glasgow City Council for comment.A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was investing £7.3bn over the next four years to help councils resurface roads.\"This will turn the tide on years of underinvestment in our road network, allowing local authorities to move away from expensive, short-term repairs and invest in proactive maintenance and prevent potholes from forming in the first place,\" they said.A Local Government Association spokesperson said that \"ever-increasing pressure on budgets has impacted their ability to do so as much as they'd like\" regarding road maintenance.\"New funding for roads will help turn the tide on the gradual decline of local roads, but this will take time to shift from simply filling potholes reactively – which pothole compensation laws require – towards a more proactive, sustainable approach.\".",

    "body": "More than 300 earthquakes were recorded in the UK in 2025, British Geological Survey data shows.The two largest earthquakes occurred just hours apart near Loch Lyon in Perth and Kinross, Scotland, when a 3.7 magnitude tremor was registered on 20 October, followed by one of 3.6. Up to 18 December 2025, 309 earthquakes had been recorded across the UK. Areas of Perthshire and the western Highlands in Scotland, southern parts of Wales, and Yorkshire and Lancashire in England recorded the most seismic activity overall. On average, the UK experienced an earthquake \"almost once a day\" in 2025, seismologist Brian Baptie said.The report said 34 earthquakes in total occurred near Loch Lyon between October and December. \"The west of Scotland is one of the more active parts of the UK,\" Dr Baptie said.Some of this can be attributed to geological faults including the Great Glen and the Highland Boundary Fault.\"By contrast, north-east Scotland experiences very few earthquakes.\"Two minor earthquakes hit Lancashire in as many weeks in December, with the epicentre of the 2.5 magnitude tremor located off the coast of Silverdale, in Morecambe Bay.The BGS confirmed the quake was an aftershock of a 3.3 magnitude earthquake which hit the area at the start of December.Seismic activity is recorded by 80 monitoring stations around the UK, operated by BGS.It said the UK experiences between 200 and 300 earthquakes a year but only about 20 or 30 are felt or heard by people.This year, it received 1,320 reports from members of the public who felt tremors this year.A magnitude-four event in the UK and surrounding areas is typically recorded every three to four years, and a magnitude-five event happens every few decades - with the most recent one in 2008 in Lincolnshire.A magnitude-six earthquake happens every few hundred years. The largest known earthquake in the UK occurred in 1931, near the Dogger Bank, in the North Sea off the coast of Yorkshire.It had a magnitude of 6.1 and was powerful enough to cause minor damage to buildings on the east coast of England, despite its epicentre being 60 miles offshore.In general, earthquakes are caused by the tectonic plates that make up the earth moving and rubbing together. Smaller earthquakes, including those experienced in the UK, can be caused by movements on geological faults in the Earth's crust.The UK is situated within the Eurasian plate, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away from the nearest plate boundary. This is why it does not experience earthquakes as large as those in other parts of the world.",

    "body": "12 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterMany in the UK who unwrapped a new drone this Christmas may face a rude awakening next week, when they will have to take a theory test before being allowed to fly outdoors.From 1 January, those intending to fly drones or model aircraft weighing 100g or more outside must complete a Civil Aviation Authority (CCA) online theory test to get a Flyer ID - something previously only needed for heavier drones.The regulator believes up to half a million people in the UK may be impacted by its new requirements.CAA spokesperson Jonathan Nicholson said with drones becoming a \"common Christmas present\" it was important people knew how to comply with the law.\"With the new drone rules coming into force this week, all drone users must register, get a Flyer ID and follow the regulations,\" he said.\"We want people to enjoy their drones but it's vital that they have checked the new rules and know how and where to operate their drone safely before they fly.\"The CAA's requirements are based on the weight or class of drones and model aircraft.Where previously a Flyer ID was only required for devices weighing 250g or more, it will soon be required to fly a drone weighing 100g or more outdoors.In addition to completing a theory test to obtain a five year Flyer ID licence, those who own a drone weighing 100g or more with a camera must also register with the CAA to get an Operator ID.According to the CAA, the new rules are designed to be easier to understand, as well as allow for \"safe expansion\" of drones across the UK.Its requirements also apply to children, but vary for different age groups. Children under the age of 13 must obtain a Flyer ID and have a parent or guardian present when completing the free flyer theory test to get one.Meanwhile those aged 12 or younger must be supervised by someone over 16 to fly drones, with parents also required to obtain an Operator ID.The CAA also wants existing drone owners and ID holders to acquaint themselves with the rules, which sets out where drones should not be flown and how to protect peoples' privacy when piloting those equipped with cameras.It says flying a drone or model aircraft without necessary IDs is against the law, and punishable by fines or, in severe cases, with prison sentences.But Dr Alan McKenna, a law lecturer at the University of Kent, said effective enforcement would likely be \"a case of resources\".He told the BBC while he believed most people would seek to abide by new UK requirements for flying drones outdoors, some may look to \"fly under the radar\".\"You're always going to get people who make mistakes or can't be bothered,\" Dr McKenna said - adding concerns about the impact of rising drone use on the environment, privacy and safety were \"wider issues\" at play.",

    "body": "6 hours agoPA MediaThe medieval David I silver coin was discovered in a wooded area near Penicuik, Midlothian, and has now been allocated to National Museums ScotlandThe earliest known coin to be minted in Scotland almost 900 years ago has been acquired for the nation after it was found by a metal detectorist.The medieval David I silver coin, discovered in a wooded area near Penicuik, Midlothian in 2023, has been dated to the second half of the 1130s.As required by law it was reported it to Treasure Trove and allocated to National Museums Scotland (NMS) by the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel.The coin was valued at £15,000, which was paid to the finder as a reward by the King's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer.PA MediaA close up of the historic coin which is almost 900 years oldThe NMS said it would be used for research but it is hoped it will go on display in future. King David I of Scotland, who reigned from 1124 until 1153, introduced the country's first coinage.Alice Blackwell, senior curator of medieval archaeology and history, said it was thought all his earliest coins were created in a mint in Carlisle, Cumbria, which he took control of in the 1130s.But she added: \"This coin is really significant because it's the first of that earliest type, the earliest coins to actually have been minted outside of Carlisle.\"It was minted in Edinburgh, so it's the first time that we have Scottish coinage being minted in what was a core part of the Scottish kingdom.\"She said any coins found before the king's reign could be Roman Age, Viking Age or  medieval coinage. David I later lost control of Carlisle.PA MediaThe reverse side of the coinThe coin found in Midlothian has a portrait of the monarch's head on one side and a cross-based design on the other.It also bears an inscription which indicates it was minted in Edinburgh.The discovery will help experts expand their understanding of how and where coins were minted in medieval times.Dr Blackwell said there was virtually no documentary sources that explained how coinage was produced in Scotland.She added: \"The coins themselves are the primary source.\"This is the first time that we can see this very early minting of coinage in Edinburgh.\"The expert added the first Scottish coins were quite rare.She also said the discovery of another had the potential to increase understanding about how the first coinage was produced and how it began to be used in Scotland.Later in the reign of King David I, coins were minted in places including Perth, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Aberdeen, St Andrews, and Roxburgh in the Scottish Borders.As well as introducing Scotland's first coinage his reign included the foundation of royal burghs such as Perth, Dunfermline and Stirling, and the reorganisation of civil institutions.",

The much-anticipated title was due to be released on 27 March, but will now come out two months later.It will be the first video game featuring the British spy since 2012's 007 Legends.In a statement developer IO Interactive, which also makes the Hitman series, said the game was \"fully playable from beginning to end\" - but extra time was needed to \"further polish\" it.It is being developed in association with Delphi Interactive, which is also behind the upcoming Fifa game due to be released on Netflix ahead of the 2026 World Cup.The latest in the Bond video game series will star Dexter Original Sin actor Patrick Gibson in the lead role, in a reimagined origin story for the iconic British spy.It will follow the story of a 26-year-old James Bond as he is recruited into MI6 and gains his 00 title, in a standalone story from the films or novels.At the Game Awards in December 2025 IO Interactive revealed the game's main villain would be performed by US singer Lenny Kravitz.Gameplay trailers have shown some similarities to the developer's successful Hitman franchise as well as showcasing the gadgets and cinematic set pieces that fans have come to expect from Bond.But some comments under the video from fans voiced concerns about how the game looked - with some pointing out a drop in frame rates, and others criticising the use of motion blur.In its latest post, IO Interactive called the game its \"most ambitious project to date\".\"We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we revealed the game,\" it said.",

    "body": "A rising number of end-of-life patients in hospitals could affect the level of treatment carried out this winter, a group of regional NHS leaders have been told. A consultant in palliative care highlighted the impending \"crisis\" during an online internal meeting of health leaders in Sussex, a recording of which has been heard by the BBC.The consultant at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust described dilemmas facing hospital managers when some patients are having to be given end-of-life care in A&E corridors.The bleak assessment is likely to be echoed in other NHS regions as building winter pressures increase the challenge of trying to find hospital beds for sick patients needing care.University Hospitals Sussex Trust includes Worthing Hospital, Royal Sussex County Hospital, St Richard's Hospital in Chichester and Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath.  Doctors and officials from East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which includes Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital, also took part in the meeting along with community health representatives. The consultant made a slide presentation entitled \"Palliative and End of Life Care in Sussex\" at the meeting, which took place on 4 November.She told the audience that local hospices were struggling and it was difficult to find places for patients who need end-of-life care, while it was sometimes not clear how much support there might be in the local community when people are sent home.She said: \"I am really worried that patients who have treatable conditions are not going to be able to get into hospital and be treated because there are so many end-of-life patients in hospital beds.\"She went on to say \"we are no longer putting patients on the waiting list for transfer who are just straightforward dying\", focusing only on those with complex needs.On giving enhanced palliative care in A&E, the consultant said it was a \"really difficult choice - do you admit them for corridor care or do you turn them round, put them in the back of the ambulance where they may die on the way home\".She argued there were \"lots of patients in hospital who don't need to be there, lots of patients with complex needs who don't have their needs met\".She concluded: \"We've all known this crisis is coming - it is getting worse and worse\".A spokesperson for the NHS in Sussex said it was committed to ensuring that patients have access to the \"best possible, high-quality palliative and end-of-life care\". They said: \"This includes providing a range of places for compassionate, person-centred care - and importantly, where possible, in settings out of hospital, such as community settings, and our hospices.  \"Emergency care services across Sussex remain under significant pressure but staff continue to work incredibly hard to make sure patients can receive the care they need at our hospitals, and across all our health and care services.\"There is robust partnership work in place over the winter period to support individual care plans, and to ensure that people are in the right NHS service for their needs.\"But the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said delayed discharges were a huge challenge across the NHS, and a lack of social or community care could mean some patients needing end-of-life care and support could not leave hospitals.  Its president, Dr Ian Higginson, said the college was \"worried about the number of patients who need end-of-life care who end up in emergency departments, and then hospitals, because the dedicated services they need are not available\". He said: \"Patients who would prefer to be at home may end up in our corridors, which are not the right places for anyone, let alone those who are at the end of their lives.\"Meanwhile, community services are also stretched and hospices are warning of a funding crisis.Toby Porter, chief executive of Hospice UK said:  \"We know just how hard staff across the NHS and care system are working to give people at the end of life the care they deserve.\"But, while hospital can be the right place for some, a busy ward just isn't the right place for most people who die.\"Hospices across the country want to provide more care in the community but this year we've seen it cut back because of funding pressures. And that is having a knock-on effect in hospitals.\"",

    "body": "Why 2026 looks bright for Northern Light sightingsImage source, Owen Humphreys/PA WireImage caption, A spectacular glimpse of the Northern Lights in Northumberland in NovemberBySimon King Lead Weather PresenterIn 2026, there is a good chance that the vivid purples, reds and greens of the Northern Lights will be visible in skies across the  UK.Over the past couple of years, the Sun has been in a heightened state of activity as part of its natural cycle. While the peak of this cycle was observed late 2024, we can still expect more major solar events in the year ahead.In mid-November 2025, a large solar flare erupted from the surface of the Sun, resulting in a spectacular display of the Northern Lights in the UK.That was not the only time we were treated to dazzling displays of brightly lit skies - sometimes as far south as Devon and Cornwall.The Sun has an 11-year cycle, ranging from periods with few sunspots and low activity, to times with many sunspots that produce increased activity and energy.During the peak of the current cycle, which Nasa confirmed occurred in October 2024, a higher number of sunspots led to more frequent eruptions of solar flares and coronal mass ejections.These events send powerful bursts of energy and charged material into space, causing, among other effects, the auroras we observe from Earth.Image caption, Solar activity reached a peak in late 2024 and in its 11-year cycle, the solar minimum is expected around 2031/32.Large solar flaresOn 11 November, a large solar flare measuring X5.1 - on a scale that runs from X1 to X10 and beyond - was observed on the Sun. It released a huge amount of energy towards Earth, resulting in one of the best aurora displays of the year, with sightings even reported in southern England.While this was the strongest flare of 2025, it did not come close to the spectacular events of May and October 2024, when X8.8 and X9 solar flares were recorded respectively.Although we are now past the peak of the current solar cycle and heading towards \"solar minimum\", expected around 2031-32, solar activity will remain relatively high through 2026.Even in a quieter year, it only takes one large solar flare or a coronal mass ejection directed towards Earth to produce a stunning Northern Lights display across the UK.The spring and autumn equinoxes can also bring a slight increase in activity due to the alignment of the Sun and Earth - what's known as the Russell-McPherron effect.This means you are roughly twice as likely to see the aurora at these times of year.Image source, NASAImage caption, A large solar flare was observed on the Sun in November 2025, sending a significant amount of energy toward Earth and resulting in a display of the Northern Lights.Improved technology and forecastingWhile seeing the Northern Lights may once have involved a trip to the Arctic Circle, there have been many more apparent sightings in the UK in recent years.This is partly due to better technology, forecasting and communication. Today, numerous satellites monitor the Sun, measuring the solar wind and the energy it emits, giving us a better understanding of solar activity and earlier warnings when it increases.This, in turn, helps forecasters predict when there may be impacts on Earth - including the chances of seeing the aurora. And most of us now have a camera on our phones capable of capturing a decent image of even a weaker Northern Lights display, which we can easily share on social media or with BBC Weather Watchers.These photos were taken by BBC Weather Watchers in November 2025.Image gallerySkip image galleryImage source, BBC WEATHER WATCHERS/Shona McMillanImage caption, Northern lights at Portobello,  EdinburghSlide 1 of 5, Beautiful blue, purple and pink sky caused by the Northern Lights early Wednesday morning, Northern lights at Portobello,  Edinburgh",

    "body": "2 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jr,Washington DCandHarry SekulichReutersDonald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky said progress had been made to end the Ukraine war during talks in Florida, but failed to reach a breakthrough on a few of the thorniest issues.The US and Ukrainian leaders met at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home on Sunday to discuss a revised peace plan, several key parts of which Russia has already rejected.On Monday, Zelensky said the US had offered security guarantees for a period of 15 years. Trump said on Sunday an agreement on this point was \"close to 95%\" done.But little has been said on the future of Ukraine's contested Donbas region, which Russia seeks to control in its entirety.ReutersMoscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.Speaking to reporters after the talks, Trump said a deal on Donbas remained \"unresolved, but it's getting a lot closer\".Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize its full control.Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaOn Monday, the Kremlin again said Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the part of Donbas Kyiv still controls. Ukraine has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by Ukrainian forces - but Zelensky has underlined that any talks on this should include the Ukrainian people, Reuters news agency reported.The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back. He later reversed course.Security guarantees and 'trilateral talks'Addressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago after Sunday's talks, Zelensky repeated his belief that an overall peace agreement was 90% of the way there, a figure he had given in the days leading up to his visit.Both leaders also indicated there had been progress on one key sticking point - security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelensky later said the US had offered security guarantees for an extendable period of 15 years, but Kyiv wanted the option of having them for up to 50 years. He  said he hoped the guarantees would begin the moment Kyiv signed a peace deal, Reuters reported.The US has not yet commented on the time frame. On Sunday, Trump said an agreement was close and that he expected European countries to \"take over a big part\" of that effort with support from the US.Trump, meanwhile, floated the possibility of trilateral talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine, saying it could happen \"at the right time\".While the US president is keen to add the Ukraine-Russia war to the list of conflicts he claims to have ended, he cautioned that stalled or scrapped talks that go \"really badly\" could mean that the war continues.Zelensky suggested the Ukrainian officials could meet at the White House in January, potentially alongside European leaders, as the US and Ukrainian delegations finalise plans for further talks.In a post-meeting call with European allies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed \"good progress\" in the Florida talks while reinforcing the need for \"ironclad security guarantees\" for Ukraine.French President Emmanuel Macron also said Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees.Trump: Agreement on Donbas 'unresolved' but 'getting closer'Zelensky later said that a peace plan should be put to a referendum in Ukraine, saying a 60-day ceasefire would be necessary for such a vote to take place.However, Russia does not back a temporary ceasefire - an issue which reportedly came up on a call between Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin ahead of Sunday's meeting.Yuri Ushakov, Russia's former US ambassador, said Trump listened to the Kremlin's assessment of the proposals and the two presidents left the call united in their belief that a temporary ceasefire proposed by the EU and Ukraine would instead prolong the conflict.The US president - who initiated the call - acknowledged that Moscow had little interest in a ceasefire that would allow Ukraine to hold a referendum.\"I understand that position,\" he added.Little further detail was offered, although Trump said he believed the Russian leader \"wants Ukraine to succeed\".Meanwhile, strikes continued overnight In Ukraine. Kyiv said 25 airstrikes were carried out by Russia on Sunday, 21 of which were shot down.Russia's Ministry of Defence said 89 UAVs were intercepted by them on Sunday night - the vast majority of which were over the Bryansk region.",

    "body": "42 minutes agoKoh EweEastern Theater CommandThe Chinese military published a video on Monday showing warships being deployed as it announced drills in the Taiwan StraitChina is holding military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".The army, navy, air force and rocket force have been dispatched for the drills which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said.Codenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (£8.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms. Taiwan's push to ramp up its defence this year has also angered Beijing, which claims the self-ruled island as its territory.Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.Its defence ministry said it had detected 89 Chinese military aircraft and 28 warships and coastguard vessels near Taiwan on Monday. The ministry said separately it had deployed its own missile systems and forces to monitor the situation,  adding they are on \"high alert\" to defend Taiwan and \"protect our people\".In a post on Weibo, the Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command - in charge of the Taiwan Strait - described the upcoming military exercise as a \"shield of justice\".\"All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield!\" the post read.While some initial drills have begun, the military said it would conduct a major exercise from 08:00 to 18:00 local time on Tuesday.Beijing's foreign ministry called the drills a \"severe punishment for separatist forces seeking independence through force\" and warned \"external forces\" against \"using Taiwan to contain China\".\"Any sinister schemes to obstruct China's reunification are doomed to fail,\" the ministry's spokesman Lin Jian said at a regular press briefing on Monday.While China has long called for the \"peaceful reunification\" with Taiwan, it also has a law stating it will resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to prevent the island's \"secession\".Beijing has accused Taiwan's president Lai Ching-te of pursuing \"Taiwan independence\". The president maintains Taiwan is already a sovereign nation and therefore has no need to formally declare independence.On Sunday, Lai said in a local television interview that Taiwan needed to \"keep raising the difficulty so [China] can never meet the standard\" for an invasion.He also said that his administration was committed to \"maintaining the status quo\" and would not provoke China - though he added that peace relies on \"real strength\".Polls consistently show that most Taiwanese people want the \"status quo\", meaning they neither want to unify with China, nor to formally declare independence.CCTVChinese state media published a map released by the military showing Tuesday's drill locations around TaiwanTaiwan's transport ministry has said both international and domestic flights will be diverted away from dangerous areas as the drills continue, affecting more than 100,000 passengers.Since 2022 Beijing has ramped up military drills in the Taiwan Strait, usually in response to what it deems as threats such as former US Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in 2022 and Lai's inauguration in 2024.China's last live-fire exercise in the Taiwan Strait, held in April, simulated strikes on key ports and energy facilities, the People's Liberation Army said at the time. Along with the drills, the Chinese military released a series of cartoons depicting Lai as a \"parasite\".This week's military drills are the first to be held under Yang Zhibin, the new chief of the Eastern Theater Command who assumed his role in October.Taiwan holds military exercises of its own, both to prepare its population for an attack and showcase its defences to Beijing. This year's Han Kuang exercise, which took place over 10 days, was the largest and longest one yet.Since taking office, Lai has vowed to boost defence spending and enhance the island's defence capabilities in the face of increasing tensions with Beijing.In October, the Taiwanese president announced the building of a dome-like air defence system to guard against \"hostile threats\" - though he did not explicitly mention China.The drills this week in the Taiwan Strait would also aim at deterrence \"outside the island chain\", China's military said.China's ties with Japan have plunged to their iciest in years after Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi suggested last month -  in response to a question asked in parliament - that Japan's self-defence forces could step in if China attacked Taiwan.China has lodged heated protests and issued warnings to its citizens to avoid travel to Japan. Earlier this month, Japan protested after Chinese fighter jets locked radars on Japanese aircraft while Beijing accused Tokyo of \"harassing\" its forces during a training exercise.",

    "body": "12 hours agoAlex TaylorBBC News reporterRyan LibbeyRyan says that becoming a dad to Leo has helped him better understand himself\"I think I was just in survival mode for a year\".Former Made In Chelsea star Ryan Libbey expected to cope with the challenges of becoming a dad.But the reality quickly became \"very different\" to what he'd imagined.Life-threatening health complications around the birth saw his partner Louise hospitalised. Suddenly he was thrust into becoming her primary caregiver as well as looking after their newborn son Leo.\"I was doing every night time, every change… every walk. The role of both mum and dad,\" Ryan told the BBC's Parenting Download.After 11 months he burnt out. It was a chat with his own dad, on a park bench, that made him realise he needed help.The simple words \"You're not in a good spot. You need some help. How can I help you?\" opened the door for Ryan to speak honestly, seek support and find a way back.His experience is not uncommon, but rarely discussed. While society is now better used to talking about the strain on mums and about post-natal depression, less is said about the struggles dads face. According to the government's recent men's health strategy for England, between 5-15% of fathers experience anxiety before and after they have a child, while 5-10% face depression.'It's not weak to ask for help'Ryan feels his struggles are part of a wider failure to communicate amongst men, who still internalise harmful perceptions of masculinity.Men, he says, often feel they must be \"the harbour wall that just gets smashed and remains standing every time.\"\"It's not a show of weakness to ask for help. I didn't do that quick enough,\" he explains. Getty ImagesProfessor Green aka Stephen Manderson chooses to keep his son's face hidden in public photosClinical psychologist Dr Jill Domoney, a researcher specialising in mental health pre and post childbirth, says men often don't want to accept they're struggling.They can feel they are \"not a legitimate person to be asking for help\" - especially ahead of a mum and baby - but she emphasises their mental well-being is just as important to the family.Ryan's conversation with his dad gave him the space to ask for a break - taking a few days abroad, away from the home environment, to gain perspective.He realised he needed to make a shift to focus on his and his partner's emotions as well as the practical tasks of taking care of a new baby. When he opened up to Louise, he realised he'd missed \"what she was yearning\" -holding her hand and listening to her.'Parenting yourself'That realisation has reshaped how Ryan sees fatherhood.He's now writing Leo weekly letters about his experiences as a dad, which he hopes his son will read as he gets older.Ryan hopes these will help his son better understand the language of emotion and make sense of his parenting choices.The idea of \"self-parenting\" is something rapper and songwriter Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - has also felt keenly since fathering his son Slimane, who is now four.As a child Stephen lacked consistent male parenting. Despite having an \"incredible\" bond with his dad, deep-held trauma meant his father struggled to cope and was \"in and out\" of his life, complicating their relationship.Stephen says suppressing feelings led him to make \"terrible decisions\" when younger to alter how he felt, finding solace in drink and drugs as escapism from the pain.\"You find your way to things that don't help,\" he explains. \"They may temporarily change how you feel, but they will ultimately make things worse.\"Tips for coping as a new dadProfessor Green and Ryan Libbey with Parenting Download co-hosts Guvna B (left) and Katie Thistleton (right)Talk to someone - if you're feeling overwhelmed, tell a friend, your partner or a professional how you're feeling. It can help to ease the pressure and make you feel less aloneRemember your hobbies - keep doing the things that helped you to feel like yourself before having a baby. It could be going for a run, seeing friends or playing video games.Don't ignore the physical stuff - eating well, getting some exercise and if you can, getting some sleep, all play a role in how your mind is doing. Spend time with other new dads - hearing about their experiences, the messy ones, as well as the good ones, can help to normalise how you're feeling Know that asking for help isn't failing - looking after yourself is the best way you can look after your familyWhen his father later died by suicide, Stephen understandably struggled to accept the loss, having not spoken to him for years.As a dad now, Stephen's determined not to \"perpetuate the cycle\" with his own son and instead offer the security and emotional guidance he missed out on.When his son threatens to have a tantrum, for example, they practise \"shaking it out\" together - processing the emotions safely.Both Ryan and Stephen say they have become better, healthier men because they faced their pain, changed how they communicate, and learned to regulate themselves for their kids.\"I'm better… sitting with things and dealing with things,\" says Stephen.\"I wrote that in a letter to Leo last week,\" Ryan says. \"I said, at times I feel like my role is to instruct and tell you what to do, but actually, it's a two-way conversation. I'm learning just as much as you are in this journey.\"If you, or someone you know, have been affected by mental health issues, please visit BBC Action Line to find information on organisations that can help",

    "body": "1 hour agoBea Swallow,West of EnglandandSteve Knibbs,GloucestershireBBCA woman in her 40s and her two young children were killed in the Boxing Day blazeA mother and her two children have been killed in a blaze that destroyed their home in Stroud on Boxing Day.The father, a serving police officer with Gloucestershire Constabulary, was able to escape and was taken to hospital.Emergency services were called to the \"well-established\" fire on Brimscombe Hill in Stroud, Gloucestershire, at about 03:00 GMT on Friday.A seven-year-old girl, a four-year-old boy and their mother, aged in her 40s, were all trapped inside the burning property. The body of the mother was recovered on Sunday but formal identification is yet to take place. 'Lost his family'Police said the father attempted to re-enter the property several times but was unable to gain entry as the blaze tore through the home.\"We have multiple witnesses to the anguish that he was going through at his inability to get in and save his children and save his wife,\" Det Supt Ian Fletcher said.\"He is, as you can imagine, in a very distraught way. He has sadly lost his family at a time which is supposed to be a happy festive period.\"The extent of the fire has caused the roof of the mid-terrace Cotswold stone cottage to fall in and the ceilings and stairs have collapsedPolice confirmed the body of one child has been located but still remains inside the property.Emergency services said they had been \"unable to recover\" the child's body \"at this time\".They are still working to locate the body of the second child but the unstable condition of the property requires teams to proceed with caution.They added that the fire began on the ground floor of the property and that there were not believed to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding the cause.Det Supt Fletcher described it as a \"tragic incident\".'Ferocity and heat'The mother and father were awoken at 03:00 GMT to the fire and attempted to reach the back bedroom where the children were sleeping.The father managed to escape the property through the bathroom window before attempting to climb through the children's bedroom window.However, he was unable to do so due to the \"ferocity and heat\" of the blaze, Det Supt Fletcher added. He attempted to re-enter through the bathroom but the fire \"had taken hold\".He then tried to force entry via the front and back door but was unable to get back inside. Det Supt Fletcher (centre) said the father is helping police to understand exactly what happenedDuring a press conference, Det Supt Fletcher said: \"We are very much in a process where we're looking to recover the bodies of all of the victims inside the property in a dignified way, in order to return them to the family.\"I can confirm the husband and the surviving member of the family is a serving police officer at Gloucestershire Constabulary. \"Our hearts and prayers go out to him and all of his colleagues. \"He is obviously working with us in order to try and understand exactly what has happened in that property.\" He added the family had asked for privacy.'Tried their hardest'Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service said its crews managed to stop the fire spreading from the mid-terraced home into neighbouring properties but the damage to the house was extensive.\"We were faced with a well-developed, serious fire upon arrival,\" said deputy chief fire officer Nathaniel Hooton. \"There is significant damage internally with loss of floors, stairwells and a collapsed roof.\"[Crews] tried their hardest to get in there and do whatever was necessary and continue to work extremely hard to support the recovery of the unfortunate loss of life.\"Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to our colleagues in the constabulary, local communities and the people who have worked extremely hard in very difficult circumstances.\" More on this story Related Internet Links",

    "body": "British-Egyptian dissident apologises for tweets as Tories push for UK deportation3 hours agoAlex KleidermanandHarry SekulichMOHAMED EL-RAAI/AFP via Getty ImagesBritish-Egyptian democracy activist Alaa Abd El Fattah has apologised for several of his old tweets that have resurfaced, as calls grow for him to be deported from the UK days after he arrived following his release from an Egyptian jail.Tory and Reform UK leaders say the home secretary should consider whether Abd El Fattah, a dual national, can be removed after social media messages showed him calling for Zionists and police to be killed. The Times reports some senior Labour MPs are also calling for his citizenship to be removed.After reviewing the historic posts, Abd El Fattah said: \"I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise.\"He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"Abd El Fattah said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after he was freed from prison in Egypt, but it is understood he was unaware of the historical messages.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage both said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood should look at whether Abd El Fattah's citizenship could be revoked to enable his swift removal from the UK.Farage said in a letter to Mahmood: \"It should go without saying that anyone who possesses racist and anti-British views such as those of Mr el-Fattah should not be allowed into the UK.\"The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Abd El Fattah's release and see him reunited with his family in the UK, but condemned his posts as  \"abhorrent\".The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair. He was granted citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother - when the Conservatives were in power and Dame Priti Patel was home secretary. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp - who was immigration minister under Patel - told the BBC he did not know of these details in 2021. He added he was now clear in his mind that \"this man should have his citizenship revoked\".\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.PA MediaIn one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he says he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".\"There is no excuse for that kind of language,\" Philp said on Monday. \"People who express that kind of hatred, that kind of anti-white racism, that kind of extremism who seek to incite violence, have no place in the United Kingdom.\"Appearing on the same programme, Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she told Today.\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it so he is a British citizen. The British government has been doing their utmost to get him back into the country and out of jail.\"The UK has responsibilities under international law to avoid leaving people stateless and British citizenship can only be stripped from someone eligible to apply for citizenship in another country. Badenoch said Abd El Fattah's reported comments were \"disgusting and abhorrent\" and anti-British, adding that citizenship decisions \"must take account of social media activity, public statements, and patterns of belief\". She said: \"It is one thing to work for someone's release from prison if they've been treated unfairly as previous governments did. It is quite another to elevate them, publicly and uncritically, into a moral hero.\"She added that Abd El Fattah \"should have received a free and fair trial in Egypt\", but \"there ends my sympathy\".In his letter to the home secretary, Farage said it was \"astonishing\" that neither MPs from Labour, the Conservatives or other parties carried out \"basic due diligence\" on Abd El Fattah while they campaigned for his release.He said Starmer showed an \"extraordinary error of judgement\" when he posted on X welcoming Abd El Fattah's return.The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the case was of  \"profound concern\".Adrian Cohen, the board's senior vice-president, said: \"His previous extremist and violent rhetoric aimed at 'Zionists' and white people in general is threatening to British Jews and the wider public.\"The cross-party campaign for such a person, and the warm welcome issued by the government, demonstrate a broken system with an astonishing lack of due diligence by the authorities.\"While conceding some of his comments were \"shocking and hurtful\", Abd El Fattah contends some of the old messages were misinterpreted.\"For example, a tweet being shared to allege homophobia on my part was actually ridiculing homophobia,\" he said in a statement. \"I have paid a steep price for my public support for LGBTQ+ rights in Egypt and the world.\"A writer, intellectual and software developer, Abd El Fattah rose to prominence during an uprising in 2011 that forced the former Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to resign.He has spent more than a decade of his life behind bars and his release in September after a presidential pardon followed a long campaign by his family and lobbying by the British government.In 2014, Abd El Fattah was nominated for a European human rights award, the Sakharov Prize, but this was withdrawn over tweets about Israel he posted in 2012.He said those comments had been part of a \"private conversation\" that took place during an Israeli offensive in Gaza and had been taken out of context.After being removed from a travel ban list imposed by Egyptian authorities that kept him in the country for three months after his release from jail, Abd El Fattah has now been reunited with his 14-year-old son, who lives in Brighton.",

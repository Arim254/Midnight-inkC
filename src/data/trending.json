    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, If Erling Haaland's form continues, he is on course to win his third Premier League Golden Boot in four seasonsByFlora SnelsonBBC Sport journalist\"We cannot replace him,\" Pep Guardiola insisted on the eve of Sergio Aguero's final game in a Manchester City shirt. Four years on, do City find their fortunes tied once again to the fitness and form of a lethal striker with unique attributes and singular talent?\"Without him, it would be tough to be honest,\" Guardiola admitted after Erling Haaland's magnificent first-half double helped City leapfrog Bournemouth with a 3-1 win on Sunday.Not everyone can boast a goalscorer of Haaland's quality, but each Premier League team has that one player they cannot do without - be it for their leadership, playmaking, or game-changing flair.From the \"soul of the team\" to an \"absolute warrior\", here are the Premier League's 20 key players, as chosen by our fan writers.Arsenal - Declan RiceArsenal have made a brilliant start and are looking convincing in their bid for a first Premier League title since 2003-04. After 10 games, the Gunners sit six points clear of second-placed Manchester City.Laura Kirk-Francis from the Latte Firm podcast has selected midfielder Declan Rice as the side's key player. \"Is there anything Declan Rice can't do?\" Kirk-Francis said.\"This season Rice has been imperious, not only delivering inch-perfect set-piece deliveries but now adding goals to his output.\"His transfer fee of £105m continues to look like a steal for the Gunners.\"The 26-year-old, who signed from West Ham in 2023, has helped Arsenal to seven clean sheets while making five goal contributions in the Premier League this season.Aston Villa - Ollie WatkinsAston Villa waited five games for their first win of the season, before a run of four successive victories took them from the relegation zone up to the top half of the table.Unai Emery's side trail third-placed Liverpool by three points but are 11th after 10 games.David Michael of My Old Man Said blog and podcast thinks Villa's key player is under-performing. \"Villa's squad relies on just one true out-and-out striker - and he has scored just once all season,\" Michael said. \"Ollie Watkins has long been praised for his all-round play, and rightly so, but he's a confidence player and Villa can't afford to wait until he's 'in the mood'.\"In a system that gives him the trust and the minutes, the goals have to come.\"The 29-year-old England striker, who is Villa's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League, has started every league game for them this season.Bournemouth - Antoine SemenyoOne of three Premier League teams to have lost just twice so far - leaders Arsenal are the only team with a solitary defeat - Bournemouth's bright start has put them in the conversation for a top-four place come the end of the season.The Dorset club have 18 points after 10 games and sit fifth in the table.When it comes to the most important player, Tom Jordan of Back of the Net podcast has little doubt.\"Currently Bournemouth's key player is unquestionably Antoine Semenyo,\" Jordan said.\"The explosive wide forward already has six goals and three assists to his name this season and is unsurprisingly grabbing the headlines.\"At only 25 years old, his ceiling is high.\"He can play anywhere across the front line, plus he possesses both extraordinary pace and power on a consistent basis.\"The Ghana international, who signed from Bristol City in 2023, has played almost every Premier League minute for the Cherries so far this season - he was taken off during added time against Nottingham Forest.Brentford - Mikkel DamsgaardAfter losing manager Thomas Frank to Spurs over the summer, Brentford are settling in well to their first Premier League season without him.With 13 points, Keith Andrews' side are six points clear of the relegation zone and five points shy of fifth after 10 games.Ian Westbrook of the Beesotted podcast thinks Danish midfielder Mikkel Damsgaard is their key player.\"He is the man who makes things tick for Brentford,\" Westbrook said. \"His vision and ability to spot and play the killer pass is unmatched in the squad and if he plays well, results generally follow.\"The 25-year-old has contributed one goal and one assist to Brentford's Premier League campaign so far. Brighton & Hove Albion - Danny Welbeck Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Danny Welbeck has made 373 appearances in the Premier LeagueInconsistent Brighton and Hove Albion have not had the same result in successive Premier League matches all season.But after 10 games the Seagulls are within touching distance of the European places, three points behind third-placed Liverpool.Scott McCarthy of We are Brighton has picked forward Danny Welbeck as the player the Seagulls can't go without. \"He is the only out-and-out striker Brighton have who is Premier League ready until such time as Fabian Hurzeler feels confident unleashing the Greek teenagers [Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas],\" McCarthy said. \"But it is not just the scarcity of other options which makes Welbeck a key player. \"When he plays well and scores goals, Brighton tend to win. \"Take note please, Thomas Tuchel.\"The 34-year-old, who last featured for England in 2018, is playing so well this season there are calls for him to be recalled to the national set-up. He has six goals in 10 Premier League appearances this season and of the four games in which Welbeck has found the net, Brighton have won three. Burnley - Martin DubravkaNewly promoted Burnley may have made an uncertain start to life back in the Premier League but they are three points above the relegation zone.The Clarets were among the most active Premier League teams in the summer transfer window, bringing 14 new senior players into the squad.Among them was Slovak goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, 36, who has been their key player so far this season, according to Natalie Bromley of the No Nay Never podcast.\"While the football world would expect us to say Kyle Walker, it's hard to see past Martin Dubravka as Burnley's key player this season,\" Bromley said. \"He's pulled out some incredible saves to preserve points in key relegation games and his Premier League experience has been vital.\"Of the 60 shots he has faced so far in the Premier League this season, the former Newcastle goalkeeper has saved 41 - more than four stops per game. Chelsea - Moises CaicedoChelsea made significant personnel changes after earning silverware on the European and world stages during Enzo Maresca's first season as manager.After 10 games, the Blues are seventh, level on points with sixth-placed Tottenham.Chelsea are missing a big name in Cole Palmer because of injury, but Will Faulks of Chelsea News thinks 24-year-old Moises Caicedo has stepped up in the England player's absence.\"Cole Palmer is Chelsea's most important player, but Moises Caicedo is running him pretty close right now,\" Faulks said.\"With Palmer out, Caicedo has even become an important goalscorer and creator, as we saw on Saturday where he effectively won the game for the Blues single-handedly.\"The Ecuador midfielder has scored three goals and made one assist for Chelsea this season.Crystal Palace - David MunozAfter defeating Premier League champions Liverpool to win the Community Shield, Crystal Palace's unbeaten start in the league lasted until October. The Eagles sit ninth with 16 points after 10 games.Alex Pewter at the FYP podcast sees winger Daniel Munoz as crucial to Palace's success.\"Daniel Munoz remains the team's key player,\" Pewter said. \"His stamina and range allows Oliver Glasner's 3-4-2-1 formation to click, as a genuine two-way threat. \"The fact that the club elected not to acquire a viable backup means the team's success hinges more on his availability than on other talents.\"The Colombian, 29, has made two assists and scored one goal in the Premier League this season. Everton - Jack GrealishEverton have made an inconsistent start to their 72nd successive season in the top flight. The Toffees sit four points above the relegation zone in 15th place. Mike Richards of the Unholy Trinity Everton Podcast believes that Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish is key to boosting their league position.\"It has to be Jack Grealish,\" Richards said. \"He is constantly singled out for 'special treatment' by the opposition due to his quality and importance to Everton in an attacking sense. \"He strikes a sense of fear into opponents and as he has proven already, his creativity stands out from the rest of the squad.\"The 30-year-old England international has made four assists and scored one goal so far in this Premier League campaign. Fulham - Ryan SessegnonA run of four Premier League defeats has left Fulham among the teams trying not to fall into the relegation zone.After 10 games, they are four points clear of 18th place. Drew Heatley at Fulhamish has nominated full-back Ryan Sessegnon as the side's irreplaceable player. \"He has found himself thrust into the first XI, mostly at left-back, as Antonee Robinson struggles with his return from summer surgery,\" Heatley said. \"But he has quickly made himself indispensable, chalking up two goals in the process.\"The Englishman, 25, has achieved a pass completion rate of 73% over nine Premier League appearances this season, according to football stat database FBref.Leeds - Noah OkaforImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Leeds United signed Noah Okafor from AC Milan in August 2025Leeds' start to their first season back in the Premier League has been mixed. After 10 games, the Whites are four points clear of the relegation zone in 16th place. Adonis Storr of the Roaring Peacock believes forward Noah Okafor is the player who makes the biggest difference for Daniel Farke's side.\"Leeds have struggled in attacking areas this season but Okafor has flair and creativity,\" Storr said. \"It will be vital for Leeds' chances of survival to keep him fit and get him firing consistently.\"With two goals, the Swiss 25-year-old is Leeds' joint top scorer, level with centre-half Joe Rodon.Liverpool - Dominik SzoboszlaiLiverpool's title defence began on a strong footing, winning all five of their opening games before a run of four defeats knocked them down the standings. The Premier League champions sit third, seven points adrift of leaders Arsenal. Dominik Szoboszlai is their key player, according to Jordan Chamberlain of Empire of the Kop. \"He's been the best of an inconsistent bunch this season,\" Chamberlain said. \"Physically incredible, Szoboszlai works tirelessly and has flair on the ball, too.\"Arne Slot should play him in midfield [all the time], not at right-back.\"The Hungarian, 25, has made two goal contributions in this Premier League campaign.Manchester City - Erling HaalandAfter a shaky start, Manchester City are six points behind leaders Arsenal. The 10-time league champions are in second place after 10 games.According to Freddie Pye of City Xtra, there's only one man in the frame for key player at City.\"With more goals than every other Manchester City players' goals tally combined across competitions, is there anything else that needs to be said about Erling Haaland's importance right now?\" Pye said. \"Keep him fit and firing in front of goal with the right service, and we could be seeing a silverware-laden 2026 at the Etihad Stadium.\"No one has scored more Premier League goals than the Norwegian 25-year-old this season, his 13-goal haul more than double the next best scorers. Manchester United - CasemiroImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Casemiro signed for Manchester United from Real Madrid in August 2022Manchester United are finding their rhythm under Ruben Amorim after they ended his first season at the helm in 15th place.They are eighth with 17 points but are only two points behind second-placed Manchester City.Alex Turk at Turk Talks FC has suggested that Brazilian midfielder Casemiro, 33, is the one player that Manchester United can't do without. \"Bruno Fernandes is the headline star and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are the new shiny toys, but Casemiro is the soul of this team,\" said Turk.\"United have conceded 18 goals this season, and he's only been on the pitch for five of them. \"Not to mention he's getting in on the attacking act, with four goal contributions in his last five appearances.\"Newcastle - Sandro TonaliNewcastle's patchy form - particularly away from home - has confined Eddie Howe's side to the bottom half of the table. The Magpies sit 13th with 12 points after 10 games. Italian midfielder Sandro Tonali has been chosen by Charlotte Robson of True Faith: Newcastle United podcast as their most important player.\"I don't think you can look past Sandro Tonali at Newcastle,\" Robson said.\"I've never seen a better midfielder play for my club - his technical ability coupled with his incredible work rate has saved us several times this season already. \"That he has signed until 2029 at least is a huge boon for Newcastle.\"The 25-year-old has made more progressive passes than any other Newcastle player in the Premier League this season, according to football stat database FBref.Nottingham Forest - Neco WilliamsNow on their third manager of the season, Forest have made a dismal start to 2025-26.Winless since their opening-day victory against Brentford, Sean Dyche's side are 19th, four points above bottom spot and four points off safety.Pat Riddell of the Famous Club has picked 24-year-old full back Neco Williams as Forest's key player.\"It's been a terrible start to the season for Nottingham Forest which makes this quite an easy choice,\" Riddell said. \"Neco Williams has had his critics in his three seasons at the City Ground but this year he's been an absolute mainstay in the side.\"The Welshman always gives 100%, is up and down whichever wing he's picked to play on and manages to attack and defend with equal ability. \"Commitment, fearlessness and determination mean he's easily one of the first names on the team sheet.\"The Welsh international has played every Premier League minute for Forest this season, and has scored one goal.Sunderland - Granit XhakaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Swiss international was named Sunderland captain by manager Regis Le Bris for the 2025-26 seasonBack in the Premier League for the first time in eight years, Sunderland have impressed.With 18 points from their first 10 games, the Black Cats are fourth.Gavin Henderson of Roker Report sees Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka as their most crucial player. \"Sunderland have taken the Premier League by storm this season, but the man leading the charge has undoubtedly been our new captain,\" Henderson said. \"Xhaka embodies professionalism and, importantly, determination. \"Sunderland are not content with finishing in the bottom three, and that's because of the mentality Xhaka has helped to instill on and off the pitch.\"An absolute warrior.\"The 33-year-old has made three assists while helping Sunderland to four clean sheets in the Premier League. Tottenham Hotspur - Cristian RomeroTottenham Hotspur are building after a season of mixed successes under former manager Ange Postecoglou. After 10 games, Thomas Frank's side are sixth with 17 points.Ali Speechly of Women of the Lane believes centre-back Cristian Romero, 27, is the side's most valuable player.\"Haters will question his temperament but real ones know the Argentinian World Cup winner is in control,\" Speechly said.\"One half of one of the best centre-back pairings in the league, 'Cuti' can also spring Spurs into attack with thrilling through-balls. \"As the team finds its feet under Thomas Frank, our captain must continue to lead by example.\"The Argentine has contributed to three of Spurs' clean sheets this season, having missed two games with an adductor injury. West Ham - Jarrod BowenWest Ham fired former manager Graham Potter after taking three points from their first five games.Against Newcastle on Sunday, West Ham claimed their first win at home and first under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo which took them up to 18th place, three points adrift of safety.In the Premier Legaue this season, no West Ham player has made more goal contributions than the 28-year-old, who has captained his club since the start of 2024-25.Wolves - Joao GomesWolverhampton Wanderers failed to get a win from their first 10 games of the Premier League season, leading to the sacking of former manager Vitor Pereira. With two points, Wolves are bottom of the table in 20th place.In terms of their most important player, Brazilian midfielder Joao Gomes has the vote of Dazzling Dave of Always Wolves.\"He shows grit, determination and heart,\" Dave said. \"He battles and controls midfield, setting the tone with energy and bite. \"Strong in the tackle and aggressive in duels, he wins second balls and keeps play moving. \"He also leads on the pitch, driving standards and rallying team-mates.\"The 24-year-old has made 51 progressive passes this Premier League season - more than any other Wolves player.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDominic CascianiHome and Legal CorrespondentBBCAlain Berset, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the political guardian of the ECHR The political head of the body that oversees the European Convention on Human Rights has told the BBC that it is \"absolutely ready\" to discuss reforms amid pressure from the UK and other countries over migration.Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, predicted that quitting international human rights law would leave the UK \"isolated\" on the world stage.He acknowledged human rights laws may need to \"change or adapt\" and the institutions, whose creation was largely led by the British after World War Two, remained crucial to peace, security and justice.Berset's words - ahead of the Convention's 75th anniversary - are the most public confirmation that the body could evolve amid mounting debate over its future across the continent. It is also public recognition that it has to talk to the UK about its future - and about potential change.The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg The council, which is unrelated to the European Union, is the international political body in Strasbourg that oversees and enforces the work of the European Court of Human Rights.The court rules on how to interpret human rights law in its 46 member states. In the UK, the government and judges must take these rulings into account, but are not bound by judgments that do not closely relate to our circumstances.Sir Keir Starmer's government has committed to changing how the government interprets the right to privacy and family life so that it can't be used by illegal immigrants to frustrate their removal from the country.In a speech earlier this year in Strasbourg, Shabana Mahmood, then justice secretary and now home secretary, said the convention itself must evolve to maintain public confidence.The Conservatives and Reform are calling for the UK to walk away from the treaty, claiming Strasbourg's human rights law is a block on managing borders.Nine EU nations, led by Denmark and Italy,  have also called for major changes - which would need the agreement of all member states.Inside the courtroom at the ECHR In a rare interview about the ECHR's relationship with the UK at the council's headquarters in France, Berset told the BBC: \"I am ready, absolutely ready, and really open to engage in all political discussions, to see what we need to discuss, maybe to change or to adapt.\"Let us engage on migration issues and to see what we need to address and maybe to change.\"The most important point is to be ready to speak on all issues without taboo... and to see then what could be the possible consensus between member states.\"Critics of the ECHR say that the advantage of leaving for the UK would be to take back control over human rights law.But Berset said: \"The opposite is true. What I see is more the risk to be a bit isolated. It would mean to be not participating to all the discussion on migration, to take an influence.\"While he said he would not comment on internal politics in the UK, Berset appealed for the debate over the ECHR had to return to \"facts\".The original ECHR declaration, agreed by the UK Government and others in 1950 He denied that it was a friend of terrorists or illegal immigrants, following criticism that the court has increasingly prevented the deportation of illegal immigrants and migrants who commit criminal offences. He said the UK also had to consider how leaving would effect Northern Ireland's power sharing agreement and the post-Brexit deal with the EU, both of which include a legal commitment to shared human rights principles.Leaving, he argued, would send a \"really negative signal\" for Ukraine because of the Council of Europe's central role, supported by the UK, in preparations for tribunals in relation to war crimes.\"Churchill was the father of the Council of Europe, and the convention,\" said Berset.\"It will be quite difficult and really hard to see this [the UK quitting]. There is no alternative. We need to have some room, places, where we are in discussion together.\"He added: \"It will be an interesting test for all of us. Are we able to avoid the wars to make sure that in this phase of divergence that we are witnessing right now, are we strong enough to make sure again, that we have convergence, take control of what we want to have as a future collectively?\"",

    "body": "2 hours agoSarah Rainsford,Southern Europe correspondent, Rome and Jake LaphamA worker who was trapped after part of a medieval tower collapsed in the heart of Rome, has died, according to hospital officials.Octay Stroici, 66, was pulled free at 23:00 local time (22:00 GMT), nearly twelve hours after a section of the Torre dei Conti, on the edge of the famous Roman Forum and close to the Colosseum, gave way and trapped him beneath.His heart stopped in the ambulance, and doctors at the hospital he was rushed to were unable to save him. The Romanian foreign ministry said Stroici was a Romanian national, as was another worker among three others pulled from the rubble. Stroici's rescue was initially described as an exceptional feat by firefighters who had worked late into the night. Rescue teams used drones and rubble clearers to try to reach him, despite the risk that the fragile tower could collapse further. He had been conscious and talking to the emergency workers throughout the rescue. His wife was also at the scene.  Stroici had been carrying out conservation work on the medieval tower just off Rome's busy Via dei Fori Imperiali and close to the Forum itself, one of this city's busiest tourist sites. This particular building had been empty and abandoned for many years. The Rome Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the incident. Part of the structure collapsed at about 11:20 on Monday and efforts to rescue Stroici were interrupted when a second section of the 29m (90ft) high tower began crumbling again about 90 minutes later, as bricks rained down, creating a huge cloud of dust.Rome prefect Lamberto Giannini had described it as a \"very complex situation\". After the initial collapse he said firefighters had \"put up some protection\" around the trapped man, so that when the second collapse happened, \"they obviously shielded him\".He added that the rescue was a long operation due to having to \"mitigate... the enormous risks faced by the people trying to carry out the rescue\".One firefighter was taken to hospital with an eye problem, according to Italian reports, but the rest were unharmed, eventually resuming their search for the man.A police chief said there was no imminent danger that the tower would disintegrate. \"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life beneath the rubble, and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy finds a positive outcome,\" wrote Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on X before the rescue was complete.Another worker, 67-year-old Ottaviano, who was inside at the time of the collapse but escaped from a balcony uninjured, told the AFP news agency: \"It was not safe. I just want to go home.\"Rome's mayor and Italy's culture minister visited the scene. The 13th Century tower was built by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his brother.It is separated from the main visitors' area of the Roman Forum by a road. The streets all around have been taped off by police as a precaution.",

They are among 10 people injured on the train during the mass stabbing.Footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, and Forest fan Stephen Crean were travelling on a LNER train from Doncaster to London King's Cross when they were attacked at around 20:00 GMT.Mr Crean has been hailed a hero after he confronted the train attacker, going face to face with him in the carriage.Mr Gjoshe was slashed across the bicep and has been operated on, his club said.Anthony Williams, 32, has been remanded in custody following the incident and is charged with 11 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident.'Incredible bravery' of train crew and passengers saved livesWhat do we know about Cambridgeshire train stabbings?Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Crean's left hand could be seen heavily bandaged and he still had blood in his hair. He is one of the train passengers the 32-year-old is accused of attempting to murder.Mr Crean described how he \"tussled\" with the man who was shouting at him as he slashed him on the head and hand.He said he first saw people running down the train shouting that there was a man with a knife. As people ran to the buffet car he said he wanted to make sure passengers were safe.\"I saw him coming towards me - a guy with a rucksack and he's obviously got something in there.\"Everyone's gone towards the buffet, and that is on the verge of being full up. There's no-one else getting in there. I wasn't even going to bother pushing to get in.\"There's young women and they need to get them in. I confronted this guy, because I've got to make sure that the door's locked and I've looked around to save a bit of time.\"But then he started, he pulled this thing out. It was an over large blade thing\".Mr Crean said the man asked him: \"Do you want to die? Do you want to die?\" \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms with him and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and must have caught me on the head.\"Scunthorpe UnitedScunthorpe United football player Jonathan GjosheMr Crean says it's nice to hear that people are calling him a hero but that he wasn't the only one.\"It's lovely to hear. But I'd say there are other heroes like the police and the guys that got me off the train and the ambulances and the hospital staff, they're probably real heroes.\"And the train guy that's really badly injured. So, you know, it's a big shout to call someone a hero, but it's nice.\"He says he was determined to confront the attacker to give another passenger time to close the buffet door. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Stephen Crean still had blood in his hair when he spoke to the BBC",

    "body": "13 hours agoShayan Sardarizadeh, James Kelly, Kris Bramwell and Benedict GarmanBBC VerifyGetty ImagesOn Saturday night a train from Doncaster bound for London was dramatically diverted after an alarm was raised on board. A man armed with a large knife, who is believed to have joined the train at Peterborough, carried out a vicious attack on multiple victims. Within 20 minutes a suspect had been arrested in Cambridgeshire, more than 70 miles from the train's intended destination of King's Cross in London.Eleven people were treated in hospital, where one person remains in a stable but critical condition. The BBC has spoken to train passengers and stabbing victims alongside video and police statements to build a picture of how the attack and the emergency response unfolded.'You need to run, you need to run'The attack started just over an hour after the LNER train left Doncaster. At 19:29 it had pulled out of Peterborough station, where the suspect had apparently boarded. Just five minutes later the alarm was pulled near the middle of the train in coach J.Amira Ostalski and a friend, both students at Nottingham University, had got on the train at the previous stop of Grantham and were travelling to London to \"have some fun\".Amira was seated watching a film when she saw a man in a white shirt leap out of his seat about five rows in front of her followed by screams of \"knife, knife\". Amira then spotted a man holding a large kitchen knife and fled towards the rear of the train with her friend.'He ran right towards us... we decided to hide in a taxi', says eyewitnessIn the next carriage, coach H, YouTuber Olly Foster heard shouts of \"run, run, there's a guy literally stabbing everyone\", and initially thought it was a Halloween prank. But as passengers began pushing through the carriage Olly could see \"blood all over the chair\" he had leaned on, covering his hand in blood.Olly then saw an older man, thought to be an LNER staff member, who \"blocked\" the attacker from stabbing a younger girl, leaving him with a gash on his head and neck.Nottingham Forest fan Joe, 24, was not meant to be on the train. He had watched the team's football match against Manchester United earlier and missed a connecting train in Grantham.Joe was texting his friends about his plans for the night when people came rushing through the carriage. \"You need to run, you need to run,\" someone told Joe. He started running but when he turned to look behind him saw \"a tall black male\" holding \"a bloodied knife\".Matt Kingston took his headphones out as he saw a group of people heading his way in coach H and also began running down the train. Another Nottingham Forest fan Alistair Day, 58, was next to the train's cafe bar in coach G, and saw people fleeing down the train with blood on their clothes.Sheltering inside the cafeThe train's cafe bar transformed into an impromptu hiding space for those fleeing the attacker. Alistair said he saw around a dozen people inside this enclosed buffet counter in coach G and they were \"trying to close up the shutters\" to protect themselves from the assailant. Matt had managed to get inside the booth with the others.Alistair saw the man near the door waving a knife and trying to open the shutters, which by then had been locked. A video he provided to the BBC from inside the cafe bar shows multiple passengers inside, with at least one on the phone to emergency services. Alistair and another witness, Tom McLaughlan, told the BBC they saw a Nottingham Forest fan move to confront the attacker. \"He wasn't the biggest guy. We tried to stop him,\" Alistair said.It appears they were referring to Stephen Crean who later told the BBC the man pulled out a large knife when he confronted him outside the cafe bar. \"He's gone for me and there was a tussle in the arms and that's where my hand, the fingers are really bad, four cuts through them, sliced. And then he raised it and must have caught me when I was ducking and diving and caught me on the head.\"PA MediaStephen Crean sustained injuries to his head and handStephen said he had been trying to give another passenger time to close the door to the cafe bar. \"That door still wasn't shut behind me, because I could still see him struggling to close it. So until I knew it was I wasn't moving away from it.\"Matt said the attacker then walked past the locked door while waving the knife around. \"He then returned back up the train and passed us again.\" At that point a young man told Matt he'd been stabbed in the chest \"so I helped with putting pressure on the wound and helped hold him up\".Another victim of the train attack was Scunthorpe United footballer Jonathan Gjoshe, who was slashed across the bicep and later needed an operation.Alarm raised and train divertedAs soon as the alarm was raised the train driver, Andrew Johnson, a Royal Navy veteran, sprang into action and contacted the control centre. The decision was made to divert the train, which was travelling at 125mph (201km/h), to a slow track, which allowed it stop at Huntingdon Station just minutes after the emergency services were first called.The East of England Ambulance Service received the first emergency call at 19:38. A minute later, Cambridgeshire police received a report about multiple stabbings on a train. Together, they mobilised a response team outside Huntingdon Station, just under 300m away from the police force's headquarters. At 19:41 the train arrived at the station, a minute before British Transport Police were also called to the incident.Escape at Huntingdon StationWatch: Police rush to scene of Cambridgeshire train attackCCTV footage captured by a business in its car park shows passengers running up platform two towards the main station building. A dramatic TikTok video, filmed from a bridge on Brampton Road overlooking the rail tracks and station, shows police officers running towards the train along the same platform.Tom saw two men who appeared to have been stabbed \"covered in blood\" as he fled the train. Alistair said he saw a man who had been in the cafe bar with him being carried towards an ambulance by paramedics. \"I just want to know he's okay,\" he said.Emergency services took 10 people to hospital where a further victim was treated. Six patients have since been discharged.The LNER staff member who remains in a critical but stable condition \"undoubtedly saved people's lives\" by trying to stop the attacker, British Transport Police said.Forced to flee againCCTV footage shows a man climbing a fence at the station at 19:43 to an adjacent car park while holding a knife.Amira, who had been hiding at the back of coach G armed with a metal tray to fight off the attacker if necessary, had run to the car park with her friend for safety when they got off the train.But they saw the man walk in their direction. Fearing for their lives, they hid in a taxi. An image captured by Amira's friend through its windscreen shows the man being detained by six police officers near several bins in the car park, around 50m (160ft) from the fence.Video filmed from a separate taxi nearby shows the officers armed with guns, Tasers and accompanied by a dog detaining a man on the ground. Clicks from the Taser are audible in the footage.By 19:50 police had two men in custody, 32-year-old Anthony Williams, and a 35-year-old man who was released a day later after police established he was not involved. On Monday morning Williams appeared in court charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over the train attack.Additional reporting by Adam Durbin.BBC Verify logo",

    "body": "10 hours agoDamian GrammaticasPolitical correspondentAn investigation into allegations that Sheffield Hallam University faced sustained pressure from China to shut down human rights research has been referred to counter-terrorism police.The BBC and the Guardian newspaper has been reporting that documents show that China had waged a two-year campaign of intimidation and harassment, including demands the university stop sensitive research by one of its professors into claims of forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China.A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said the force has referred the investigation on because the \"allegations fall under Section 3 of the National Security Act\".Section 3 of the act deals with \"assisting a foreign intelligence service\".An offence is committed if someone behaves in a way that \"intends that conduct to materially assist a foreign intelligence service in carrying out UK-related activities,\" or in conduct likely to assist that service.Internal documents from Sheffield Hallam University were released under a Subject Access Request to Professor Laura Murphy, whose research is alleged to have been targeted.They showed university staff in China had been threatened by individuals identified as being from China's National Security Service, who demanded the research by Prof Murphy taking place in Sheffield be shut down.The documents went on to state that \"a decision by the university not to publish a final phase of the research on forced labour in China was communicated to the National Security Service... Immediately relations improved and the threat to staff wellbeing appears to be removed\".China is not believed to have an organisation named National Security Service, so it is not clear who the individuals were.A few months later, at the start of this year, Prof Murphy was told by the university that she could not continue her work on China. She started legal action for infringement of her academic freedom. The university then reversed its position. In a statement issued earlier, Sheffield Hallam University had apologised to Prof Murphy.A spokesperson said: \"The University's decision to not continue with Professor Laura Murphy's research was taken based on our understanding of a complex set of circumstances at the time, including being unable to secure the necessary professional indemnity insurance.\"The insurance for social sciences staff had been suspended by the university's insurers as a Chinese firm had brought a defamation suit against Sheffield Hallam after it was named in a report she produced. That lawsuit is ongoing.The university spokesperson added: \"Following a review, we have since approved Professor Murphy's latest research and are committed to supporting her to undertake and disseminate this important work.\"For the avoidance of doubt, the decision was not based on commercial interests in China. \"Regardless, China is not a significant international student market for the University.\"We have apologised to Professor Murphy and wish to make clear our commitment to supporting her research and to securing and promoting freedom of speech and academic freedom within the law.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "10 hours agoShiona McCallumSenior technology reporter Online pornography showing strangulation or suffocation is to be made illegal, as part of government plans to tackle violence against women and girls.It follows a review which found depictions of choking were \"rife\" on mainstream porn sites and had helped normalise the act among young people.Both the possession and publication of such material will be a criminal offence, under amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill currently going through Parliament.Online platforms would also be required to proactively detect and remove such material or face enforcement action via media regulator Ofcom.The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said the change would make choking in pornography a \"priority offence\" under the Online Safety Act, putting it on the same level as child sexual abuse material and terrorism content.Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: \"Viewing and sharing this kind of material online is not only deeply distressing, it is vile and dangerous. Those who post or promote such content are contributing to a culture of violence and abuse that has no place in our society.\"We're also holding tech companies to account and making sure they stop this content before it can spread,\" she added.Conservative peer Baroness Bertin warned earlier this year that there has been a \"total absence of government scrutiny\" of the pornography industry.Her independent review, published in February, cited an account of a 14-year-old boy asking a teacher how to choke girls during sex and warned that people imitating such behaviour \"may face devastating consequences\".The government pledged in June to table amendments to the Bill which would outlaw showing choking in online pornography.A BBC survey carried out in 2019 suggested 38% of women aged 18-39 had been choked during sex.Bernie Ryan, chief executive of the Institute for Addressing Strangulation, welcomed the government's amendment, saying choking can send \"confusing and harmful messages\" to women about what to expect in intimate relationships.\"Strangulation is a serious form of violence, often used in domestic abuse to control, silence or terrify,\" she said.Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, described the amendments as \"a vital step\" towards tackling the normalisation of violence in online content.\"There is no such thing as safe strangulation; women cannot consent to the long-term harm it can cause, including impaired cognitive functioning and memory,\" she said. \"Its widespread portrayal in porn is fuelling dangerous behaviours, particularly among young people.\"But campaigner Fiona Mackenzie, founder of the group We Can't Consent To This, was less optimistic of the proposed law's effectiveness.She argued there were already existing laws against showing choking in pornography, but which were not enforced in practice. This included the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which criminalises the possession of extreme porn, including that showing life-threatening acts.\"More than five years ago, young women told us that social media sold strangulation of women as normal, as an expression of passion,\" she said.\"The porn sites make this normal for men - and none of those sites have ever felt the impact of the existing law.\"So a change in law or practice is needed. It's possible that this time the government might actually do something about this. \"However until we see otherwise, I don't believe that any new law will actually be enforced.\"The government said in June, when the amendment was pledged, that it built on existing laws, including the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.",

Other acts on the bill include Pendulum, Cypress Hill, Babymetal and Black Veil Brides. They'll be joined by metal heavyweights Trivium, Mastodon and Architects, alongside indie-rockers Feeder and Ash, across the weekend of 10 to 14 June.Linkin Park's presence at the top of the bill will mark the first time a female-fronted band has headlined the three-day rock and metal event since its launch in 2003.The nu-metal group reformed last year with Emily Armstrong as their new lead singer.They have gone on a world tour and recorded their first new material since the death of former frontman Chester Bennington, who took his own life in 2017.The choice of Emily upset some fans, who pointed to her alleged ties to the Church of Scientology and past support for convicted rapist Danny Masterson.Chester Bennington's family also criticised the band with his son, Jaime, accusing remaining members of \"quietly erasing\" his father's \"life and legacy\".Emily has distanced herself from Masterson, while Linkin Park founding member Mike Shinoda has insisted she is not trying to replace anyone.Next year's Download will also be a first for Limp Bizkit, who have never headlined the festival.Their appearance at this year's Leeds Festival was the last time they performed live with founding member and bassist Sam Rivers, who died last month aged 48.Rock legends Guns N' Roses are currently in the middle of a world tour, and recently appeared at Ozzy Osbourne's final live show in his hometown of Birmingham. Download bills itself as a festival \"spanning the full spectrum of rock, metal, punk, emo, hardcore, alternative and classic rock\".In recent years Download has also featured pop acts and surprise guests, with the Vengaboys an unlikely addition to 2024's line-up.And Dogstar - the band formed by actor Keanu Reeves - are due to perform in 2026.

    "body": "3 hours agoSeveral papers lead with news that police are probing whether a man accused of stabbing 10 people on a train that passed through Peterborough on Saturday had been involved in separate incidents in the 24 hours before the attack. According to the Daily Express, \"three opportunities may have been missed to stop an alleged knifeman\", adding that 999 calls were made about three separate incidents in the lead up to the train stabbings. The paper quotes a statement from Cambridgeshire Police which says it is \"currently reviewing all incidents in the timeframe to understand whether there were any further potential offences\".The Metro says that an \"investigation\" has begun into whether police \"missed a series of chances\" to stop Anthony Williams, 32, who was accused of 10 attempted murders on the Doncaster to London train on Saturday night, \"another at a DLR station in the capital hours earlier, weapons offences and assaulting a police officer while in custody\".Williams' alleged links to separate stabbing incidents also leads the Times. It writes Cambridgeshire Police referred itself to the police watchdog, the IOPC, but it did not meet the criteria for a referral because \"none of the injured had made police contact before they were attacked\".The police's investigation into the alleged train attackers links to \"a string of earlier knife-related incidents\" leads the Independent.\"Three heroes have been praised for trying to stop Saturday's train horror,\" the Daily Mirror reports. The paper writes the train driver was \"hailed\" for making an unscheduled stop at Huntingdon station, while a train staff member and passenger were \"hurt as they confronted the knifeman\".The Daily Star leads with a profile on the \"hero football fan Stephen Crean\", reporting he \"grabbed a knife from the train attacker\". The paper says Mr Crean was asked by the attacker \"do you want to die?\"Meanwhile, various other papers lead with mooted tax rises in the November Budget. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"signals 'tough but fair' Budget\", the Financial Times reports. Sir Keir \"promised to tackle the national debt but ruled out deep cuts to public spending\", the paper writes. It adds that many Labour MPs are \"resigned\" to  the Chancellor Rachel Reeves breaking the party's manifesto pledge \"not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or value added tax (VAT)\".\"Reeves paves way for tax-raising budget,\" the Guardian writes, giving a preview of the chancellor's speech later today \"in which she will be 'candid' about the tough choices ahead\".The Daily Mail also leads with a preview of the chancellor's speech on Tuesday in Downing Street, reporting she will \"address 'speculation' about the contents of her November 26 Budget – when she is expected to raise taxes by up to £30billion\". \"Chancellor to give strongest hint yet that she will raise income tax in a key pre-Budget speech,\" leads the i Paper.The Daily Telegraph reports that the BBC \"doctored\" a Donald Trump speech by \"making him appear to encourage the Capitol Hill riot\", according to an \"internal whistleblowing memo\" seen by the paper. It writes that a Panorama programme broadcast a week before the 2024 US presidential election \"misled\" viewers. The paper says a 19-page dossier on \"BBC Bias\" was compiled by a recent member of the BBC's standards committee and \"is now circulating in government departments\". The paper quotes a BBC spokesman who says: \"While we don't comment on leaked documents, when the BBC receives feedback it takes it seriously and considers it carefully.\"Many of the front pages focus on speculation that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to increase income tax in this month's Budget.The Guardian says Reeves is expected to \"lay the groundwork\" when she makes a speech at Downing Street on Tuesday morning, adding she is going to be \"candid\" about the choices ahead. The Daily Telegraph says the Chancellor is expected to say she's taking the \"necessary steps\" to fix public finances for \"years to come\".The Financial Times reports that Labour MPs are now \"resigned\" to Rachel Reeves breaking the party's election manifesto promise not to raise rates of income tax, national insurance or value added tax (VAT). It adds that the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer heightened speculation when he told Labour MPs that the budget would \"reject\" austerity. \"Reeves softens us up for tax betrayal,\" is the Daily Mail's take.The investigation into the mass stabbing on a train travelling between Doncaster and London on Saturday continues to feature prominently in most of the papers. The Daily Mirror's front page focuses on the bravery displayed by some of those on board the train who intervened, including a passenger, with the headline: \"Heroes of the train horror.\"The Daily Telegraph says its seen a whistleblowing memo accusing the BBC of editing a speech by Donald Trump to make it appear he had encouraged the 2021 Capitol riots. The claims relate to an edition of Panorama shown last year. The concerns were raised in a 19-page dossier written by a former independent external adviser to the corporation's editorial guidelines and standards committee. In a statement, the BBC said it did not comment on leaked documents but added that when the corporation received feedback it took it seriously.The Times reports that the government is to scrap the English baccalaureate, a performance measure used by schools in England that tracks pupil attainment in core GCSE subjects. As part of the changes, the paper says, schools will also no longer be assessed on the number of pupils taking modern foreign languages.And as David Beckham prepares to receive his knighthood at Windsor Castle today, the Daily Mail says his wife Victoria has made his suit for the occasion. \"Suits you sir!\" is the headline.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "14 hours agoJennifer McKiernanPolitical reporterCivil service bosses have told MPs that Lord Mandelson, who was sacked as UK ambassador to the US due to close links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, was never formally interviewed for the job.The head of the civil service, Sir Chris Wormald, said there was no interview because Lord Mandelson was directly appointed to the role.MPs heard that process meant Lord Mandelson was not directly asked about any conflict of interest with interviewers in person, but instead needed to fill in a form aimed more at potential financial conflicts.Sir Chris said this process has been changed since Lord Mandelson's exit, to ensure a formal, minuted interview happens.Lord Mandelson replaced career diplomat Dame Karen Pierce in Washington DC in December 2024, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer decided he was the best candidate to build links with the newly-elected Trump administration. Concern around Lord Mandelson's friendship with Epstein were raised at the time, but his ability to deal with President Trump, as well as his ability as a networker and seasoned political operator, was seen as a valuable asset.That changed when emails were published showing Lord Mandelson sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced charges for sex offences in 2008, which the government insisted was new information about the \"depth\" of the pair's relationship.Sir Keir fired him in September, a day after having told MPs the Labour peer retained his \"full confidence\" at PMQs.Ambassadors are managed by the Foreign Office and the civil service, and bosses of both were answering questions from MPs on the Foreign Affairs Committee.Foreign Office head, Sir Oliver Robbins, was asked whether Lord Mandelson went through the normal process for appointing an ambassador and told MPs: \"No, it was different because this was not run as a standard civil service process.\"Labour MP Fleur Anderson asked whether Lord Mandelson's interview specifically included the opportunity to share \"anything that could bring the government into disrepute\".Sir Chris said: \"There was no interview for Mr Mandelson, it was done as a direct appointment by ministers, as Sir Oliver has described, and therefore there was no panel interview.\"That was the normal practice for direct ministerial appointments.\"Changes have been made since Lord Mandelson's sacking, Sir Chris added, \"so that we effectively replicate what would normally happen in a panel interview... where there is a minuted conversation with the candidate\".Sir Oliver said Lord Mandelson did complete a conflict of interest form, but when pressed on whether that included \"friendships\", he said: \"No, it's not a sort of reputational conflict that's being targeted by that form, it's about reality of perception of economic or financial conflicts.\"The two were also questioned on why Sir Keir appeared not to have been fully briefed about the seriousness of the new information by civil servants before defending Lord Mandelson at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs).Conservative MP Sir John Whittingdale set out how emails were sent to the Foreign Office by journalists at Bloomberg on Tuesday evening. He said: \"It must have been apparent to you before the prime minister got up at 12 o'clock on Wednesday that this was pretty explosive and did somebody not say to Number 10 'hold on, just before you express your complete confidence in Lord Mandelson there's something here you might like to be aware of'.\"Defending the material being treated \"sensitively and as a management issue\", Sir Oliver said he needed to treat Lord Mandelson \"as an employee to whom I owed a duty of care\". Sir John responded: \"So you're saying to protect Lord Mandelson you gave no indication to Number 10 before PMQs that you had come across information which might cause serious doubt as to the appropriateness of his position?\"Lord Mandelson had not had a chance to respond to the Foreign Office about the \"veracity and risks\" around the emails ahead of PMQs, Sir Oliver said, adding \"I had not personally spoken to the prime minister, no.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "New Attenborough doc captures lion saving pregnant hyena from wild dogs 8 hours agoElizabeth DawsonEnvironment ResearcherPregnant hyena forced to take risks, saved by lion-sized distractionRare hyena behaviours have been caught on camera, including a mother-to-be trying to steal food from wild dogs and outsmarting rivals by hiding a stolen carcass underwater to mask its scent.This is just some of the remarkable animal behaviour on display in the new BBC wildlife documentary series, Kingdom, which follows the lives of four rival carnivore families over five years.​​The scenes include poignant moments as the animals face threats from snare trappings to brutal ambushes and violent territorial battles. \"We could never have written a script like this, only nature could write this script,\" said executive producer Mike Gunton.​​Behind the scenes, the Zambia Carnivore Programme works to protect these animals.BBC StudiosLeopard Mutima was followed by filmmakers from a cub to an adult​​The team followed four animal families - leopards, hyena, wild dogs and lions - in Zambia's Luangwa Valley, capturing rare moments and revealing the intricate dynamics of life in one of Africa's wildest regions.Viewers will watch five-day-old lion cubs opening their eyes, alongside dramatic scenes shown in Kingdom for the first time, such as a pack of wild dogs rescuing one of their own from the jaws of a crocodile.Other wild animals like elephants and baboons also feature in the new series, which is narrated by Sir David Attenborough.BBC StudiosThe Luangwa Valley is home to Zambia's largest lion population​\"Everything about these species has been shaped by millions of years of competition alongside each other,\" said series producer Felicity Lanchester. \"Now…humans are changing that,\" she added.Filmmakers and scientific researchers in the region have collaborated behind the scenes as the footage is a valuable source of data, informing conservation strategies.​​\"We got a lot of information that we wouldn't have been able to get otherwise... on topography, diet, movement, births, and deaths,” said Dr Matthew Becker, scientific consultant for the series and CEO of the Zambia Carnivore Programme.BBC StudiosA cinematographer films a curious hyena in ZambiaThe greatest threat these large carnivores face is habitat loss, while snaring and a declining prey base also play a role. Wire traps, or snares, are often set for antelope - both for food and illegal trade - but many large mammals become victims as by-catch.These pressures are changing pack sizes, diets and survival strategies, according to Dr Becker. A single incident can have knock-on effects, impacting dozens or even hundreds of animals.​​In one scene, a wild dog reappears after losing a leg in a snare trap. Despite his injury, his natal pack welcomes him back, ensuring he eats his share and keeps up on hunts.​​For those not as fortunate, the Zambia Carnivore Programme exists to protect them. The organisation, along with other local groups, removes snares, safeguards dens and provides information for law enforcement on illegal trade in ivory and bushmeat.BBC StudiosA pride of lions plays beside a riverReflecting on the conservation focus of the series, Dr Becker said: \"Ultimately, it's a message of optimism in the face of some very concerning trends.\"​​Its incorporation in wildlife programmes is now an inevitability, according to the producers. The external forces acting on these creatures are clear and series like Kingdom can shed light on the need to protect them.Speaking about conservation, ​​series editor, Simon Blakeney, said: ​​\"It’s a challenge, but it's not hopeless.\"Kingdom begins on BBC One at 18:20 GMT on Sunday and will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

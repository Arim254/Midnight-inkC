    "body": "7 hours agoJoshua NevettPolitical reporterPA MediaThe UK has sent back 281 migrants to France so far under its one in, one out agreement with the country, the home secretary has said. Shabana Mahmood told LBC 350 people had come to the UK from France through the pilot scheme's approved route.The Home Office blamed an \"operational complication on the French side\" for the difference between the two figures. The department added this had prevented a flight carrying migrants from the UK from being transferred to France, but subsequent flights would \"restore balance in the numbers\". The Conservative's shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"This is a lamentable admission of failure by the home secretary. \"They have only removed 281 illegal immigrants when 41,000 arrived last year - the chances of an illegal Channel migrant being removed under this scheme is virtually zero.\"Defending the deal, Mahmood acknowledged the number of removals was \"relatively small\" but said there were \"practical issues\" about how quickly people could be detained.Ministers hope the scheme will deter people from attempting to enter the UK illegally on small boats via the English Channel by threatening removal to France.A total of 41,472 migrants crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - almost 5,000 more than the previous year.It was the highest number since 2022, when nearly 46,000 migrants crossed.Under the deal with France, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will come in return.The UK can immediately detain anyone who crosses the Channel and, within about two weeks, agree with the French authorities to return the individual.The numbers have fluctuated since the scheme started last September, with France taking 26 back and the UK accepting 18 in return by October 2025.The numbers of migrants coming in both directions had been small at first.They appear to have increased in recent months, but remain modest relative to the number of Channel crossings.Speaking to LBC, Mahmood said: \"There are very normal discrepancies in these numbers.\"They are still relatively small numbers. But the thing I would say is, this was a pilot. It was designed to try to prove that this new model of working with the French could work.\"And there are practical issues around how quickly you can detain people and then get them on a plane and move them out to France.\"She added that numbers are \"already growing\" and that an initial problem encountered under the scheme was that they could not find enough people to come to the UK because of a lack of awareness of it.\"You've got to compete with organised immigration crime to get your messages out. We've managed to put some of those issues right,\" she said.Downing Street also defended the figures.\"We've always been clear, the numbers will fluctuate,\" the prime minister's spokesman said.\"I think at the beginning of the agreement the numbers were higher in terms of us sending people to France than receiving people under the safe returns route. But those numbers will fluctuate.\"",

One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

The Greens, on 13.2%, came third.The Conservatives (7.9%) and Liberal Democrats (3.8%) were respectively fifth and sixth.'Easy manner'In a post on X, the Workers Party of Britain described Sarwar as a \"star councillor\" and said Labour had \"forgotten\" about them.Writing on the same social media platform from his own account, Galloway praised Sarwar's \"easy manner\" and said he had first met him \"on a freezing night\" when he was handing out hot food to the homeless.If Burnham had been successful in a by-election, it would have triggered a mayoral election to replace him in Greater Manchester.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Labour's resources should be \"focused on the elections that we must have, not the elections that we don't have to have\".About 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter urging the NEC to reconsider its decision to block Burnham.Earlier, Reform UK unveiled GB News presenter and academic turned activist Matt Goodwin as its candidate for the by-election.The date for the by-election has yet to be finalised.",

    "body": "3 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesA former French senator has been found guilty of spiking an MP's drink with ecstasy in order to sexually assault her.Joel Guerriau received a four-year prison sentence - 18 months of which are to be served behind bars - and, according to local media, was ordered to pay Sandrine Josso €5,000 (£4,348) in damages for emotional distress. Guerriau, now 68, had invited Josso, 50, to his Paris flat in November 2023. He later admitted serving her a drink spiked with MDMA, but maintained it was an accident and denied having any intention of assaulting her.Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said it was a \"huge relief\", AFP reports. Meanwhile, Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal.According to court documents quoted by French media, Josso said she had gone to Guerrieau's home three years ago to celebrate his re-election when she started feeling unwell after drinking from a champagne glass.\"I had gone to visit a friend and I discovered an aggressor,\" she said on Monday while giving evidence in the trial. \"He looked at me insistently, I'd never seen him that way. I didn't want to show him my weakness, because I was worried that if I told him I wasn't feeling well, he would've forced me to lie down.\"Josso recalled managing to leave the flat and, with the help of a colleague, went to hospital where a toxicology report confirmed her blood had three times the recreational dose of MDMA.Guerriau told the court he had been going through a period of depression, and had meant to take the drug himself the night before. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he said.\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"He added: \"We don't talk about the effects of these drugs enough... All I want is to speak out on the dangers of these products.\"Getty ImagesSandrine Josso remains an MP for the centre-right MoDem partyAsked about the several internet searches he made around ecstasy and the drug GHB, he said he had no recollection.\"I was on the train, thoughts and ideas just come to you,\" he told the court, adding government members needed to show an interest in \"all current events\".Guerriau, a centre-right senator from the Horizons party, was suspended when the charges against him came to light. He resigned as a senator last October.Josso, who is still an MP for the centre-right MoDem, has become a staunch campaigner against so-called chemical submission - drug-facilitated sexual assault.\"What I went through is still very painful,\" Josso said, speaking to French media ahead of the trial beginning. \"Psychological trauma feels like being frozen in time... I jump at the slightest thing. I've become very vulnerable.\"Josso has gone on to join an association against chemical submission, set up by Caroline Darian - the daughter of Dominique Pelicot, who in 2024 was found guilty of drugging his wife Gisele and inviting men to rape her in their home for over a decade.Josso was often in court during the Pelicot trial. This week, Darian and her brother David attended the proceedings in the Guerriau case.",

    "body": "3 hours agoHelen Willetts,BBC WeatherandKathryn ArmstrongWatch: Stranded cars and rough seas as Storm Chandra hits UKLarge parts of the UK have been hit by strong winds and flooding as Storm Chandra sweeps across the country.The third named storm of the year has caused road closures, as well as rail, ferry and flight cancellations. Schools closed in some parts of England and Northern Ireland, and thousands of properties were without power as winds gusted up to around 80mph.Yellow warnings for wind, rain and snow remain in force across parts of England, Scotland and Wales, while an amber warning for wind is in place in the north and east of Northern Ireland, including Belfast.This latest weather front comes days after Storm Ingrid caused widespread damage and disruption over the weekend.Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesMotorists contended with heavy flooding near Belfast International airportNational Rail has warned that the poor weather could impact journeys across England, Scotland and Wales until Friday.As of Tuesday evening, there were hundreds of flood warnings in place across the UK, including 95 in England.Rain in parts of south-west England is falling on already saturated ground, making flooding more likely.Firefighters in Devon and Somerset said they had rescued people from 25 vehicles that were stuck in floodwater on Tuesday morning.A major incident was declared in Somerset on Tuesday evening after about 50 properties were hit by flooding. Council leader Bill Revans said heavy rainfall had caused \"widespread disruption\" and warned people to avoid travelling if possible.Honiton and Sidmouth MP Richard Foord said there were reports of around 20 flooded properties across Devon and Cornwall - a figure expected to increase as river levels peak.Oliver Kimber in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, said the lane he lives on was inundated with water.\"There was so much water and it was so fast that it just had nowhere else to go, and it was pushing it back up through the drains,\" he told BBC Radio Cornwall. The heavy rain saw several locations - including Katesbridge in Northern Ireland, Mountbatten in Plymouth and Hurn in Dorset - set new January daily rainfall records.PA Media/Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue ServiceThe town of Axminster was among those in Devon to experience floodingA severe flood warning, indicating a danger to life, was issued in Upper Frome, Dorchester, while another severe warning ended earlier on Tuesday in Ottery St Mary, Devon - where the Environment Agency said the River Otter had reached its highest recorded level.\"At the moment, it's a raging torrent,\" Jackie Blackford, whose house overlooks the river, told BBC Radio Devon. \"It is horrendous - I've never seen anything like it.\"Sections of several roads in Dorset, Somerset and eastern Devon have been closed due to flooding and fallen trees.Local police have asked people not to travel in Exeter, as well as east and mid-Devon, due to increasing reports of flooding. More than 40 schools have either fully or partially closed across the county.Watch: Latest weather forecast as Storm Chandra brings rain and wind to UKThe Met Office says further downpours are expected for the south-west on Thursday, which may lead to more flooding and transport disruption.Some schools in the West Midlands were closed due to flooding, and flood warnings are also in place for parts of Yorkshire. Rain is forecast overnight into Wednesday in south-east England, while the Met Office is warning of travel disruption due to rain and snow across a swathe of northern England, as well as in the Pennines and south-western Scotland, where the wind mixed with rain and snow could create blizzard-like conditions.Up to 5cm of snow is predicted, while as much as 20cm could accumulate on higher ground. A section of the A66 between Bowes in County Durham and Brough in Cumbria has already been shut because of the snow.Flooding is expected around the River Monnow at Forge Road, Osbaston, as well as at a number of locations along the Afon Lwyd. Gwent Police earlier said the A40 was flooded between Abergavenny and Raglan.PA MediaA plough clears snow in Middleton-in-Teesdale, County DurhamPA MediaA fallen tree blocked a lane in Houghton-le-Spring, SunderlandStrong winds are still a hazard for several areas, particularly south-western parts of Scotland, England and Wales.In Northern Ireland, more than 10,000 properties were without power and more than 300 schools were closed on Tuesday. Peak wind gusts reached 80mph at Orlock Head on the Ards Peninsula.Several domestic flights to and from Belfast Airport were cancelled, while Scottish regional airline Loganair cancelled at least 12 flights on Tuesday. Ferry services between Belfast and Liverpool were also cancelled, and several scheduled services from Belfast and Larne were disrupted.Outside the UK, the Electricity Supply Board (ESB) in the Republic of Ireland said around 20,000 homes, farms and businesses were without power.Storm Chandra is the third major storm to hit the UK in January, arriving shortly after Ingrid and Goretti - the latter of which was described by the Met Office as among the most impactful to hit Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in 30-35 years.Skies are expected to clear on Tuesday, but plummeting temperatures after the heavy rains are expected to bring ice hazards.The Met Office has issued yellow warnings for much of the UK on Wednesday as icy patches are expected to develop.Additional reporting by Chloe Gibson and Christine ButlerMore on this story",

    "body": "1 hour agoFaisal Islam,Economics editorandOliver Smith,Business reporterAI is going to \"change everything\", says Cisco boss Chuck RobbinsWinners will emerge from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom, but there will be \"carnage along the way\", the boss of a US tech giant has warned.Chuck Robbins, chairman and chief executive of Cisco Systems, told the BBC the technology will be \"bigger than the internet\", but the current market is probably a bubble and some companies \"won't make it\".Cisco, one of the world's leading technology companies, is behind some of the critical IT infrastructure enabling day-to-day use of AI.Robbins said some jobs will be changed, or even \"eliminated\", by AI, particularly in areas like customer services where companies will need \"fewer people\", but urged workers to embrace, not fear, the technology.His comments follow a series of warnings over the recent surge in investment in AI, with some claiming the sector amounts to a bubble set to burst, rocking markets and bankrupting companies.The BBC has been told of similar concerns by leading figures in finance and tech. JPMorgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon said some of the money invested in AI would \"probably be lost\", while Google parent company Alphabet's chief executive Sundar Pichai said there was some \"irrationality\" in the AI boom.Sceptics compare the supposed bubble to the dotcom boom and bust of the late 90s.Cisco was the world's most valuable company in the year 2000, but saw its value fall by 80% when the dotcom bubble burst.It has since rebuilt, and now partners with firms such as Nvidia, providing the essential infrastructure underpinning AI.Despite having £1.3bn in orders in the current quarter alone, Robbins is alive to comparisons with the dotcom collapse.\"There's been a lot of discussion about: 'Is this a bubble?'. And the answer is probably yes, but we had a bubble in 2000 with the internet. And look at where we are today.\"So the winners emerge, and there's carnage along the way, but it is going to be bigger than the internet,\" he said.\"It feels a lot like it (the dotcom crash), but what happens is you'll have money that will be invested in companies that won't make it, but the winners will emerge, the applications and use cases will begin to evolve.\"Robbins compared AI to iPhones, with the constant development of new applications, saying new uses for the technology will develop over time.He said it will make \"lots of things better\", but also has \"potential risks we all have to mitigate\".Boom And Bust: Is AI The New Dotcom Bubble?Embrace AI at work, don't fear itOne risk is to people's livelihoods, with growing fears AI will lead to mass job losses.Robbins said some jobs will be eliminated, while others will be changed, but workers can thrive if they embrace and learn to use the technology.\"You shouldn't worry as much about AI taking your job as you should worry about someone who's very good using AI taking your job,\" he said.Another risk of AI is online safety, Robbins warned.\"It's going to make our cyber attacks better. It's going to make the scams that people see in their inboxes seem more real,\" he says.But Cisco is using quantum technology in a bid to mitigate the risks of AI to security online.Robbins said: \"Every time we've had a big technological revolution, there's always a security risk associated with it, and the industry is pretty good at figuring out and actually building technology that helps protect from those kinds of things.\"'Good odds' for UK becoming an AI superpowerAmerica and China are currently the dominant AI powers, with the countries battling it out for supremacy in the technology.But Robbins said the UK was also making progress in the field and had \"pretty good odds\" of becoming an AI superpower itself.\"It's early enough right now, and I think the one thing we know is that the countries who embrace AI are going to be the countries that win. \"And I think that the UK has always been forward-leaning on these technology transitions,\" he said.As well as driving the development of AI, Robbins has a key role as a go-between for the business community and US President Donald Trump.Robbins is chair of the Business Roundtable, representing America's leading companies, and speaks to the Trump administration on a regular basis.On dealing with the sometimes unpredictable US president, he said there is \"a misconception\" that business leaders should be more vocal in questioning and critiquing his policies.But he said the reality was that, if trying to achieve an outcome, \"a better way to do it, particularly with this administration, is in small groups\".He went on: \"It's probably the most accessible administration that we've had in decades. So they're very open. We have lots of dialogue.\"\"We don't always agree, but we at least have the dialogue.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoDominic HughesHealth correspondentAlmost a quarter of adults in England do not drink alcohol, according to new figures from a government-backed NHS health survey. The data suggests that young people, and increasing numbers of men in particular, are shunning booze.The latest data from the Health Survey for England for 2024 suggests 24% of adults said they haven't drunk alcohol in the previous year.But far fewer older people abstain from alcohol and those who do drink, are likely to do so at more dangerous levels.Between 2011 and 2022, the number of adults who claimed not to drink alcohol had been fairly stable, at around 19% – almost one in five. But these figures suggest that figure has risen, with almost a quarter of adults saying they haven't drunk alcohol in the past year. Age and sex are playing a significant part in attitudes towards booze. Some 39% of young men say they had abstained from alcohol. This compares to around 16% of men aged 65 and older, who say they don't drink. Among women, 31% - almost a third of those aged 16 to 24 - are non drinkers. But for older women aged 55 to 64, just 17% - fewer than one in five - don't drink. And of those who do consume alcohol – both men and women – older people aged 65 to 74 are almost twice as likely to do so at risky levels compared to younger people aged 25 to 34.Income also plays a role, with people living in more deprived areas tending to drink less than their more affluent neighbours.The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week and spreading intake over three or more days.One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.Campaigners say that while it is encouraging that fewer people are undertaking risky drinking, millions are still consuming alcohol at levels that could threaten their health.Jem Roberts, head of external affairs at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, says this latest survey shouldn't distract from the scale of alcohol harm in England.\"Millions of people are still drinking at levels that significantly increase their risk of serious harm, from alcohol-related cancers to life-changing injuries and long-term illness, and we have seen record high alcohol deaths in recent years,\" he said.The most effective way to reduce the record number of alcohol deaths is through measures such as minimum unit pricing, clear health warnings on alcohol labels, restrictions on alcohol availability, and comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing, he added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSteve SwannSouthwark Crown Court Getty ImagesDiezani Alison-Madueke was Nigeria's minister of petroleum resources from 2010 to 2015More than £2m was spent at Harrods on behalf of a then-Nigerian oil minister accused of accepting bribes from industry figures interested in government contracts, a court in London has heard.Diezani Alison-Madueke, 65, is alleged to have been provided with \"a life of luxury in the United Kingdom\", including the use of multimillion-pound properties, a chauffeur driven car, travel by private jet, and £100,000 in cash.Other benefits she allegedly received included £4.6m spent on refurbishing properties in London and Buckinghamshire, the trial at Southwark Crown Court was told.She denies five counts of accepting bribes and a charge of conspiracy to commit bribery.Alison-Madueke was minister of petroleum resources between 2010 and 2015 under then-President Goodluck Jonathan.Jurors were told that over £2m was spent on behalf of Alison-Madueke at Harrods  using the payment cards of Nigerian businessman Kolawole Aluko and the debit card of his company Tenka Limited. The defendant had her own personal shopper at the store, only available to Harrods Rewards Black Tier members who must spend over £10,000 a year, the court heard.Jurors were also told she lived some of the time in the UK where she was provided with a housekeeper, nanny, gardener and window cleaner.The salaries and other running costs were paid for by the owners of energy companies who had lucrative contracts with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, the court was told.\"This case is about bribery in relation to the oil and gas industry in Nigeria during the period 2011 to 2015,\" said Alexandra Healy KC, prosecuting.\"During that time those who were interested in the award and retention of lucrative oil and gas contracts with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation or its subsidiaries the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company and the Pipelines Product Marketing Company, provided significant financial or other advantages to Alison-Madueke.\"Healy added: \"It might seem strange to be dealing here in the UK with a case that concerns bribery in relation to the Nigerian oil and gas industry.\"We live in a global society.  Bribery and corruption undermine the proper functioning of the global market. \"There is an important public interest in ensuring that conduct in our country does not further corruption in another country.\"PA MediaThe court heard Alison-Madueke had her own personal shopper at HarrodsJurors were also shown photographs inside a property called The Falls in Gerrard's Cross, Buckinghamshire, which was bought in 2010 by Nigerian businessman Olajide Omokore, owner of a company called Atlantic Energy.From late 2011 Alison-Madueke allegedly had exclusive use of the house which has a cinema room. The court heard she stayed there three or four times over two years, and spent six weeks at the property writing a book about the president of Nigeria.She was assisted by a chef and the driver of car whose role included dropping off shopping for Alison-Madueke, whom he knew as \"HM\" - short for honourable minister.It was said that this, along with £300,000 worth of refurbishment, was paid for by Tenka Limited. The court was told Aluko also had contracts with state-owned entities that were in the process of securing new oil contracts.The court heard that between May 2011 and January 2014, £500,000 was also paid in rent for two flats in a block in central London where Alison-Madueke and her mother lived. Records seized at the Tenka offices in Nigeria show the company settled the bill, it was claimed.Alison-Madueke sat in the dock besides oil industry executive Olatimbo Ayinde, 54, who is charged with one count of bribery relating to Alison-Madueke and a separate count of bribery of a foreign public official.Alison-Madueke's brother, former archbishop Doye Agama, 69, is charged with conspiracy to commit bribery and joined the trial by video link for medical reasons.Ayinde and Agama also deny the charges against them.The trial – expected to last about 12 weeks - continues.Oil plays a significant role in Nigeria's economy, but the population at large has not seen the benefits.It is one of the 13 members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), set up to deal with the worldwide supply of oil and its price.",

    "body": "1 hour agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentVulnerable people are missing out on benefits because they are being directed to online calculators they cannot use, a charity has said.Many are entitled to financial support but rarely have access to face-to-face advisers to help them claim, according to the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, leaving an estimated £24m in support unclaimed each year.One woman has told the BBC how her life and home were saved because someone sat down with her and her paperwork for hours.But Helen Fisher, who now runs advice services herself, said she feared people were now being sent to online services that left them confused and missing out when their finances were already severely stretched.\"It means they will get into further debt and more and more brown envelopes will come through the door,\" she said.Helen, now aged 69, had to give up work to look after her husband, Ken, who had suffered a stroke.The family soon found they were falling behind on payments and were under threat of having their home repossessed.\"I was at the end of the road as I could not afford to feed Ken and [daughter] Jemma and to heat our home,\" she said.\"We had bailiffs wanting council tax. The energy was about to be disconnected. I could not afford petrol for the car to take Ken to medical appointments.\"Helen was contemplating suicide, but it was only when an adviser came to her home  to do a comprehensive benefits check that their life was turned around. The family were entitled to a host of benefits, grants and charitable assistance. Their home was saved, and an award of pension credit - in particular - provided a gateway to other support. That continued even after Ken died in 2010, at the age of 62.Now Helen helps others in Liverpool who \"are too busy caring for someone to juggle all these things\".But she has noticed that many people with mental health difficulties face a lack of personalised, face-to-face advice despite needing \"hand-holding and guiding\" as they fill in forms and look at their finances.\"Generally, I put them on the right track. Their anxiety is alleviated and gradually they gain the confidence to manage these matters by themselves,\" she said.In its report published on Wednesday, the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute - a charity set up by Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis - said that an estimated £24m of financial support went unclaimed every year.It suggested:Many vulnerable people were unaware support was availableOnline benefits calculators were difficult for many people with mental health conditions to use, owing to symptoms including difficulty concentrating and trouble processing complex informationLimited funding meant debt advice services were often overstretched and varied in different parts of the countryThe charity has called for a more coordinated strategy, for personalised advice to be stepped up and banks and providers of other essential services to refer customers for support more often.Helen Undy, chief executive of the institute, said: \"It is alarming that in the midst of a cost of living crisis, so many people with serious financial and mental health problems are missing out on this vital support to boost their income.\"People tell us that this support has been lifesaving when they have been dealing with really severe financial and mental health problems. It is unacceptable that the way these services are funded means that many people miss out because the support they need isn't available in their areas.\"The Money and Pensions Service, which is government-sponsored and funds services through a levy on the financial services industry, said debt advice it had funded identified £84m to go to people in 2024-25. \"We are investing significantly into debt advice services in England, and we will continue to work with debt advice providers to ensure that people in debt can achieve a better financial future,\" said Christy McAleese, head of debt policy at the service.",

    "body": "11 hours agoTarah Welsh,Housing correspondentandJennifer ClarkeGetty ImagesThe government has set out more details of its planned shake-up of the leasehold system in England and Wales. The draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill includes plans to cap ground rent at £250, ban the sale of new leasehold flats and give homeowners greater control over how their buildings are managed.What is leasehold?There are around five million leasehold properties in England and Wales, of which 70% are flats.At the moment, the freeholder of a property generally owns the building and the land beneath it, outright and forever. Leaseholders effectively buy the right to live in the property for a fixed period of time.Leasehold flats are found in all sorts of properties - from converted Victorian houses to purpose built skyscrapers - and tend to be concentrated in big cities.Scotland and Northern Ireland have different systems of property ownership.What is ground rent and how are the rules changing?Ground rent is the fee paid by leasehold homeowners for the land beneath their buildings. It must be paid under the terms of their lease, and the amount due can double or increase in line with inflation at fixed intervals, which can make it difficult to sell or get a mortgage for a property.Ground rents were abolished for most new residential leasehold properties in England and Wales in 2022, but remained for existing leasehold homes.The government says approximately 3.8 million properties still attract ground rent across England and Wales, with homeowners collectively paying more than £600m in 2025. The English Housing Survey estimates the average annual ground rent in 2023/2024 was £304. As part of the government's reforms, ground rent will be capped at £250, before falling to a \"peppercorn\" rate - effectively zero - after 40 years.The bill will now be scrutinised by MPs on the Housing Committee before making its way through Parliament, with the cap potentially coming into force in late 2028.What is commonhold and will leaseholds be banned?Campaigners have long argued that England and Wales's system of flat ownership is unfair, with leaseholders having little control over property costs.Labour's 2024 election manifesto promised to \"finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end\".Under the bill, leasehold will be banned \"except in limited cases\", and developers will no longer be allowed to sell new flats as leasehold.Instead, new flats will be sold as commonhold - where neighbours collectively own the ground their flats are built on as well as the building itself. The commonhold model is widely used across the world. Long-term campaigner Sebastian O'Kelly from the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership charity welcomed the bill: \"This is a transformative bit of legislation that will turn leaseholders into proper flat owners, as is already the case in the rest of the world.\"However, it is not yet clear how existing leasehold properties will transition to the commonhold model.  A government consultation on commonhold closes on 24 April.What are service charges and how are the rules changing?Leaseholders pay annual service charges to cover the cost of maintenance and repairs. The BBC has been contacted by hundreds of people who say their charges have spiralled in recent years. The former Conservative government had already said it would make service charges more transparent in the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024, which took effect just before the last general election. The current Labour government says its reforms will build on those changes to make service charge bills clearer and help people challenge unfair costs.It also says the move to commonhold will give existing home owners unlimited control over their properties. The government has also said it will scrap something called \"forfeiture\". This process allows freeholders to start court action to seize someone's property if they have a service charge debt of more than £350. It's rare, but it does happen.This will be replaced by a new court-led process \"with strict safeguards for more extreme cases\".The government is also consulting on how to tackle the issue of charges levied on homeowners who have property on private estates.How have freeholders reacted to the government's plans?Many freeholders have reacted angrily.Last year a group of freeholders unsuccessfully tried to challenge the previous government's leasehold reforms in the High Court.The Residential Freehold Association criticised the ground rent cap as a \"wholly unjustified interference with existing property rights\". It says it will mean many professional freeholders will leave the sector, \"hinder[ing] building safety projects and disrupt[ing] the day-to-day lives of residents\".It called on the government to focus on other aspects of housing reform, \"such as regulating managing agents, improving transparency and raising professional standards\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoAndrea RacekovaBBC Scotland NewsReutersUp Helly Aa is a celebration of Shetland's Norse heritage that takes place in January every year Vikings and hundreds of torchbearers have marched through the streets of Lerwick for Europe's largest fire festival.The world-famous event lights up the skies above Shetland's capital every year on the last Tuesday in January when local \"guizers\" throw their torches at a replica of a Viking long ship until it is consumed by flames. A nod to Shetland's Norse heritage, the parade is led by a group of Vikings, locally known as the \"Jarl Squad\".Lynden Nicolson, who is the squad's chief called Guizer Jarl, had to wait 18 years to take up the role of commanding the procession - this is said to be the longest wait in the festival's 145-year-old history.ReutersThe Junior Jarl Squad kicked off the evening festivities with their own paradePA MediaGuizer Jarl Lynden Nicolson rode the hand-crafted galley during the parade before it was set on fireReutersHundreds of revellers, divided into more than 40 squads, marched through the streets of LerwickWhen the darkness descended on Britain's most northerly islands on Tuesday, the Jarl Squad was joined by more than 40 other torch-clutching groups of revellers for the evening procession - the festival's main event.It culminated with the burning of a replica galley - a Viking long ship - that the main squad had built themselves throughout the year.As he watched his galley \"Skyldulid\" slowly turn to ashes, Guizer Jarl Lynden couldn't contain his excitement.Speaking to BBC Scotland News, the 58-year-old meter technician said: \"I'm on a high, I'm feeling half my age.\"The day has gone by in a flash - everybody tells you it will - and what a flash it was.\"It's so brilliant to be in that galley and watch the torches go around, there is just not enough words to describe it,\" he added.ReutersLeading the ranks of the Junior Jarl Squad was 14-year-old Frankie WaltersonPA MediaUp Helly Aa comes to an end with the burning of a hand-crafted Viking long ship  PA MediaAround 1,000 torches were used to turn Skyldulid - a replica of a Viking long ship - to ashes The festival began early in the morning with a parade around Lerwick, allowing the Jarl Squad to show off their custom-made suits, helmets and shields.All members of the group were involved in the making of their Viking clothes in some way - a feat that took years to complete.The design for their wolf-head helmets alone took Lynden and local artists Dirk Robertson and Andrew Tate almost three years to finalise.The results of their hard work were met with excited cheers and shouts from hundreds of onlookers who braved the sleety weather to watch the daytime procession.

They travelled to Shetland to experience Up Helly Aa from up close instead of just seeing snippets of it on the news.Tom said: \"To follow the squad around and to do the chants is unbelievable.\"Seeing how much effort they've put into it is just amazing,\" he added.The brothers from Invergordon were joined by locals supporting their family members in the squad, and visitors from as far as Singapore and Canada.Lynden and the 65 members of his Viking company, aged between six and 87, spent the rest of the day singing and dancing in schools, care homes and community centres.The celebrations were set to continue until the early hours of Wednesday, which is declared a public holiday.

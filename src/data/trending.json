One year on, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids in US cities are one of biggest political issues dividing America right now, with questions over how ICE agents are behaving and who they are targeting.\nIn this episode, Anthony, Marianna and Justin look at whether ICE agents are going beyond their remit, and is public opinion starting to turn against the president? \nWe focus on Minneapolis after the killing of 37 year old Renee Nicole Good two weeks ago, who was shot dead by an ICE officer.  Anti-ICE protests have been ongoing within the city, and this week, the Vice President JD Vance who was visiting Minneapolis called for Democrats to co-operate with the Trump agenda.  \nJustin talks to John Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama who gives us his insight into how ICE agents are being vetted and recruited, plus the wider impact of diverting billions of dollars into Trump’s enforcement operations.  \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\n• Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent \nGUEST: \nJohn Sandweg, former Acting Director of ICE under President Obama \nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Purvee Pattni and Laura Cain.

The Greens, on 13.2%, came third.The Conservatives (7.9%) and Liberal Democrats (3.8%) were respectively fifth and sixth.'Easy manner'In a post on X, the Workers Party of Britain described Sarwar as a \"star councillor\" and said Labour had \"forgotten\" about them.Writing on the same social media platform from his own account, Galloway praised Sarwar's \"easy manner\" and said he had first met him \"on a freezing night\" when he was handing out hot food to the homeless.If Burnham had been successful in a by-election, it would have triggered a mayoral election to replace him in Greater Manchester.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Labour's resources should be \"focused on the elections that we must have, not the elections that we don't have to have\".About 50 Labour MPs have signed a letter urging the NEC to reconsider its decision to block Burnham.Earlier, Reform UK unveiled GB News presenter and academic turned activist Matt Goodwin as its candidate for the by-election.The date for the by-election has yet to be finalised.",

Schools have closed in some parts of England and Northern Ireland, where thousands of properties were without power.Yellow warnings for wind, rain and snow remain in force across parts of England, Scotland and Wales, while an amber warning for wind is in place in the east of Northern Ireland, including Belfast.This latest weather front comes days after Storm Ingrid caused widespread damage and disruption over the weekend.Charles McQuillan/Getty ImagesMotorists contend with heavy flooding near Belfast International airportNational Rail has warned that the poor weather could impact journeys across England, Scotland and Wales until Friday.Rain in parts of south-west England is falling on already saturated ground, making flooding more likely.Firefighters in Devon and Somerset said they had rescued people from 25 vehicles that were stuck in floodwater on Tuesday morning.Honiton and Sidmouth MP Richard Foord said there were reports of around 20 flooded properties across Devon and Cornwall - a figure expected to increase as river levels peak.Oliver Kimber in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, said the lane he lives on was inundated with water.\"There was so much water and it was so fast that it just had nowhere else to go, and it was pushing it back up through the drains,\" he told BBC Radio Cornwall. PA Media/Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue ServiceThe town of Axminster was among those in Devon to experience floodingThe severe flood warning, indicating a danger to life, has been issued in Upper Frome, Dorchester, while dozens more flood warnings and alerts are in place across the country.Another severe warning ended earlier on Tuesday in Ottery St Mary, Devon - where the Environment Agency said the River Otter had reached its highest recorded level.\"At the moment, it's a raging torrent,\" Jackie Blackford, whose house overlooks the river, told BBC Radio Devon. \"It is horrendous - I've never seen anything like it.\"Sections of several roads in Dorset, Somerset and eastern Devon have been closed due to flooding and fallen trees.Local police have asked people not to travel in Exeter, as well as east and mid-Devon, due to increasing reports of flooding.

Rain is still forecast in south-east England, while the Met Office is warning of travel disruption due to rain and snow across a swathe of northern England, as well as in the Pennines and south-western Scotland, where the wind mixed with rain and snow could create blizzard-like conditions.Up to 5cm of snow is predicted, while as much as 20cm could accumulate on higher ground. A section of the A66 between Bowes in County Durham and Brough in Cumbria has already been shut because of the snow.Heavy rain has now cleared southern Wales but dozens of flood alerts remain in place in other parts of the country.Flooding is expected around the River Monnow at Forge Road, Osbaston, as well as at a number of locations along the Afon Lwyd. Gwent Police earlier said the A40 was flooded between Abergavenny and Raglan.PA MediaA plough cleared snow in Middleton-in-Teesdale, County DurhamPA MediaA fallen tree blocked a lane in Houghton-le-Spring, SunderlandStrong winds are still a hazard for several areas, particularly south-western parts of Scotland, England and Wales.In Northern Ireland, more than 10,000 properties were without power and more than 300 schools were closed on Tuesday.

    "body": "A frowning horse plush has become a viral bestseller ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations for the year of the horse in China.The sad-looking soft toy was originally made in error after a worker sewed a smile on the horse upside down, the owner of Happy Sister - a shop in the eastern city of Yiwu - told Reuters news agency.Zhang Huoqing had expected to have to issue a refund to the customer who bought the toy, but after an image of it started circulating online the horse began selling out.Zhang said the animal's gloomy expression was resonating with young workers in China.\"A lot of customers like it, and they said it makes sense: that it suits the spirit of today's corporate slaves,\" Zhang said.\"This crying horse really fits the reality of modern working people,\" she added.\"People joked that the crying horse is how you look at work, while the smiling one is how you look after work.\"Zhang's factory has surged production to meet demand - including from other countries, according to media reports.One buyer, known online as Tuan Tuan Mami, was quoted by the South China Morning Post as saying: \"This little horse looks so sad and pitiful, just like the way I feel at work.\"With this crying toy in the Year of the Horse, I hope to leave all my grievances at work behind and keep only happiness.\"The newspaper says the horse is about 20cm (7.8in) tall and costs 25 yuan (£2.62). It is red for good luck, with a golden collar and bell around its neck, and has the phrase \"money comes quickly\" embroidered on its body in golden letters.Another shop owner in Yiwu, Lou Zhenxian, told Reuters she thought the toy was ugly, but \"it's the kind of emotional value young people look for these days\".She described young people going to work in the kind of state like the crying horse, and when you get off work \"being immediately happy\".\"But actually if everyone chases that kind of sentiment, the young people's way of thinking, it's not quite right. I believe you should work hard when at work and be happy after work, it shouldn't be two extreme opposites,\" she said.Lunar New Year will be celebrated in February to usher in the year of the horse - one of 12 animals repeated in a cycle under the Chinese zodiac calendar.

    "body": "3 hours agoDominic HughesHealth correspondentAlmost a quarter of adults in England do not drink alcohol, according to new figures from a government-backed NHS health survey. The data suggests that young people, and increasing numbers of men in particular, are shunning booze.The latest data from the Health Survey for England for 2024 suggests 24% of adults said they haven't drunk alcohol in the previous year.But far fewer older people abstain from alcohol and those who do drink, are likely to do so at more dangerous levels.Between 2011 and 2022, the number of adults who claimed not to drink alcohol had been fairly stable, at around 19% – almost one in five. But these figures suggest that figure has risen, with almost a quarter of adults saying they haven't drunk alcohol in the past year. Age and sex are playing a significant part in attitudes towards booze. Some 39% of young men say they had abstained from alcohol. This compares to around 16% of men aged 65 and older, who say they don't drink. Among women, 31% - almost a third of those aged 16 to 24 - are non drinkers. But for older women aged 55 to 64, just 17% - fewer than one in five - don't drink. And of those who do consume alcohol – both men and women – older people aged 65 to 74 are almost twice as likely to do so at risky levels compared to younger people aged 25 to 34.Income also plays a role, with people living in more deprived areas tending to drink less than their more affluent neighbours.The NHS recommends not drinking more than 14 units of alcohol a week and spreading intake over three or more days.One unit of alcohol is 10ml of pure alcohol, which is equivalent to half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.A small glass of wine contains about 1.5 units, a standard glass is 2.1 and a bottle of wine contains 10 units.Meanwhile, a can of lager, beer or cider is two units. A pint is two or three units, depending on whether it is lower or higher strength.Campaigners say that while it is encouraging that fewer people are undertaking risky drinking, millions are still consuming alcohol at levels that could threaten their health.Jem Roberts, head of external affairs at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, says this latest survey shouldn't distract from the scale of alcohol harm in England.\"Millions of people are still drinking at levels that significantly increase their risk of serious harm, from alcohol-related cancers to life-changing injuries and long-term illness, and we have seen record high alcohol deaths in recent years,\" he said.The most effective way to reduce the record number of alcohol deaths is through measures such as minimum unit pricing, clear health warnings on alcohol labels, restrictions on alcohol availability, and comprehensive bans on alcohol marketing, he added.",

    "body": "3 hours agoGuy HedgecoeMadrid correspondentThe Spanish government has announced a plan to legalise the status of undocumented migrants, a measure expected to benefit at least half a million people.Regularisation will be available to foreign nationals who do not have a criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months prior to 31 December 2025.\"This is an historic day for our country,\" said Elma Saiz, Spain's minister of inclusion, social security and migration. The measure will provide beneficiaries with an initial one-year residence permit, which can then be extended. Requests for legalisation are expected to begin in April and the process will remain open until the end of June.\"We are reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, integration, co-existence and which is compatible with economic growth and social cohesion,\" Saiz said.Spain has seen a large influx of migrants in recent years, mainly from Latin America.The conservative think-tank Funcas found that the number of undocumented migrants in Spain had risen from 107,409 in 2017 to 837,938 in 2025 - an eight-fold increase. The highest number of undocumented arrivals currently living in Spain are believed to be from Colombia, Peru and Honduras.Spain's socialist-led coalition government has been an outlier on this issue among the larger European nations, underlining the importance of migrants for the economy. The country has been outperforming the other main EU economies in recent years, posting expected growth of close to 3% in 2025.Unemployment, a longstanding weakness of the Spanish economy, has dipped below 10% for the first time since 2008, according to figures released on Tuesday.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has described immigrants as representing \"wealth, development and prosperity\" for Spain, pointing to their contribution to the social security system.The government and parties on the left have also emphasised the need to treat migrants in a humane way.\"Providing rights is the answer to racism,\" said Irene Montero, of the far-left Podemos party and a former minister in a coalition government with the Socialists.She has campaigned for this measure, which followed an agreement between the party and the government. A civic legislative proposal, calling for a mass migrant regularisation, received the support of around 700,000 people but had been languishing in parliament.This measure will be approved by royal decree, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval.It is the first large-scale migrant regularisation in Spain for two decades.Several such initiatives, by governments of both the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), legalised the status of an estimated half a million migrants between 1986 and 2005.However, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, said the latest mass legalisation would \"increase the pull effect and overwhelm our public services\".Pepa Millán, spokeswoman for the far-right Vox, said the initiative \"attacks our identity\", adding that the party would appeal before the Supreme Court in a bid to block it.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has told reporters he stands behind his speech in Davos calling out unconstrained super powers, after a Trump official said he had \"aggressively\" walked it back in a call with US President Donald Trump. \"To be absolutely clear, and I said this to the president, I meant what I said in Davos,\" Carney said on Tuesday, confirming he and Trump had spoken by phone.US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told Fox News on Monday that Carney was \"very aggressively walking back\" some of the remarks to Trump.Carney made global headlines for his Davos speech, in which he indirectly called out the US president for a \"rupture\" in the postwar world order.Trump responded in his own Davos speech the following day by saying that \"Canada lives because of the United States\". Speaking to reporters in Ottawa on Tuesday, Carney denied Bessent's recollection of the phone call.He added that it was the US president who had called him on Monday, and that the two had a \"very good conversation on a wide range of subjects\", including Ukraine, Venezuela, Arctic security and Canada's recent trade agreement with China.Carney said the two also discussed the USMCA, a free-trade pact between Canada, the US and Mexico that is up for a mandatory review later this year.Carney said his speech in Davos clearly outlined how \"Canada was the first country to understand the change in US trade policy that (Trump) had initiated, and we're responding to that\".He added that the president understood Canada's position. In the Fox News interview on Monday, Bessent criticised Canada's decision to negotiate a trade deal with China. He added that he was \"not sure what the Prime Minister was thinking\" when he made his speech in Davos.\"Canada depends on the US,\" Bessent said. \"There's much more north-south trade then there could ever be east-west trade.\"\"The prime minister should do what's best for the Canadian people rather than try to push his globalist agenda,\" the treasury secretary added.His remarks came after Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on its goods if it allows Chinese goods to flow freely to the US, skirting levies.The deal between Ottawa and Beijing would lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax a limited number of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.Carney said that Canada is not pursuing a free-trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Carney added that he believed Trump's latest tariff threat is a negotiation tactic ahead of talks on USMCA.\"The president is a strong negotiator, and I think some of these comments and positioning should be viewed in the broader context of that,\" he said.",

    "body": "Joe Root hopes Harry Brook's 'beer smash' celebration will be \"received the right way\".The England captain celebrated his match-winning century against Sri Lanka by imitating a famous WWE wrestler.Brook was recently involved in a late-night drinking scandal where he was struck by a bouncer the night before captaining a match in New Zealand.The 27-year-old was almost sacked as captain as a result, but was ultimately given a final warning for his off-field behaviour and fined the maximum amount of £30,000.When Brook reached three figures in Colombo following an astonishing, series-winning century that took him just 57 balls, he celebrated by taking off his batting gloves, striking them together and then tipping them towards his mouth.The move was first performed by former WWE wrestler 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, who would have two beers thrown to him on stage, before hitting them together and drinking them in the ring.Brook confirmed after the match that the celebration was a tribute to Austin, and also an acknowledgement of his attempts to win back the trust of his teammates.\"It was just more about celebrating tonight with the boys,\" Brook explained.\"Like I said the other day in my press conference, I've got to try and gain that trust back with the lads and the way I wanted to do that was perform, play well and lead from the front.\"Root, who was batting with Brook at the time, said he hoped Brook's celebration would be received with the humour it was intended.\"I think that's his way of doing that really,\" Root said. \"He's trying to show he wants that approval from the group, through humour.\"That's another area of why he's going to be a great leader, because he has that side to him as well.\"He's showed his calmness and his clarity under pressure, and he's also showed humour as well in doing that.\"Hopefully it's received in the right way because there's definitely no malice behind it, or anything other than trying to have a bit of a joke with his team-mates.\"It is not the first time an England international has referenced an alcohol-related disciplinary issue in a celebration, with Paul Gascoigne famously performing the 'dentist's chair' following his iconic goal against Scotland in Euro 1996.\"I think he's been excellent in every aspect,\" Root said of his captain. \"He's grown throughout the three games and he didn't panic tonight when they got off to an absolute flyer.\"It's easy to do when you're on top but when a team throws a few punches back at you, to stay calm and manage it like he did was another example of why I think he's going to be an excellent captain in white-ball cricket.\"I think he's gone a long way to earning that trust back, he certainly has in the dressing room.\"",

We all know someone who was killed in the protests.\"For Parisa, a 29-year-old from Tehran, the crackdown by security forces in Iran earlier this month was unlike anything she had witnessed before.\"In the most widespread previous protests, I didn't personally know a single person who had been killed,\" she said.Parisa said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since protests over worsening economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and then evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.With one human rights group reporting that the number of people confirmed killed has passed 6,000, several young Iranians able speak to the BBC in recent days, despite a near-total internet shutdown, have described the personal toll.Parisa said one 26-year-old woman she knew was killed by \"a hail of bullets in the street\" when the protests escalated across the country on Thursday, 8 January, and Friday, 9 January, and authorities responded with lethal force to crush them.She herself took part in protests in the north of Tehran that Thursday, which she insisted were peaceful.\"No-one was violent and no-one clashed with the security forces. But on Friday night they still opened fire on the crowd,\" she said.\"The smell of gunpowder and bullets filled the neighbourhoods where clashes were taking place.\"SOCIAL MEDIA via REUTERSThe protests were sparked by economic hardship but quickly widened into demands for political changeMehdi, 24, who is also from Tehran, echoed her assessment of the scale of the protests and violence.\"I had never seen anything even close to this level of turnout and such killings and violence by the security forces,\" he said.\"Despite the killings on Thursday [8 January] and threats of more killings on Friday, people came out, because many of them could no longer endure it and had nothing left to lose,\" he added.Mehdi described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces.\"I saw a young man killed right in front of my eyes with two live rounds,\" he said.\"Motorcyclists shot a young man in the face with a shotgun. He fell on the spot and never got back up.\"The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people since the unrest began, including 5,804 protesters, 92 children and 214 people affiliated with the government. It is also investigating 17,000 more reported deaths.Another group, Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.AFPShotgun cartridges and rubber bullets recovered on Tehran streets on 8 JanuarySahar, a 27-year-old from the capital, said she knew seven people who had been killed.She described how the security forces' response to the unrest escalated rapidly on 8 January.During a protest that evening, Sahar and her friends sought refuge in a nearby house after tear gas was fired.\"My friend stuck his head out of a window to see what was going on and they shot him in the neck,\" she said.Another friend was wounded by pellets and later bled to death after avoiding going to hospital out of fear of being detained, according to Sahar.Sahar said a third friend died while being detained by the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC).\"They [officers] told his family to come to the IRGC intelligence office. After a few days they rang and said, 'Come and collect the body.'\"On 9 January, Sahar said, live ammunition was fired openly and \"without mercy\" by uniformed security personnel.\"They were pointing lasers at people, and locals were opening their car park doors for us to hide,\" she said.The communications blackout compounded the trauma.\"Right now there's no news at all,\" Sahar said. \"Without internet or phone lines we had no idea what was happening to anyone. We could barely get calls through just to get bits of news.\"One video showed a green laser pointed towards a large crowd of protesters in TehranParham, 27, described widespread use of pellet guns by security forces in Tehran, particularly targeting protesters' faces and eyes.One of his friends, Sina, 23, was shot in the forehead and eye on 9 January.\"We took him to a hospital, but the doctor could only give us a prescription and told us to leave as soon as possible,\" Parham said.At an eye hospital, he added, wounded protesters arrived constantly.\"Every 10 minutes, it felt like they were bringing in someone else who had been hit by a pellet.\"A worker at the hospital's cafe said she had seen \"70 people with eye injuries come in during a single shift\", according to Parham.Sina - who still has pellets stuck behind one of his eyes and in his forehead - said they had been scared of being arrested at the first hospital because of the need to give their ID numbers, so they had gone to a private eye hospital.He said he was \"lucky\" compared to the others who he saw at the eye hospital, who had \"pellets all over their faces and in both of their eyes\".The BBC has seen a medical document in Sina's name that says \"there is a 5mm metallic foreign body\" behind his eye.The medical records of a number of other protesters with pellet-gun wounds have also been received and verified by the BBC.EPAIran's leaders have portrayed the unrest as \"riots\" fomented by the USProtesters and activists have also described a pattern of refusal by the authorities to hand over the bodies of those killed to their families.Mehdi said his friend's cousin was killed and that the family was told by officials to either pay a large sum of money to receive his body or agree to him being recorded as a member of the security forces.\"They said, 'Either pay 1 billion tomans [more than $7,000; £5,000] for us to hand over the body to the family, or you have to say he was a member of the Basij and was martyred for public security and against the riots.'\"Navid, a 38-year-old from Isfahan, also said two close friends whose relatives were killed had received such an ultimatum.\"They say you have to pay the equivalent of several thousand dollars or let us issue them a Basij card so they are counted among the security forces' dead,\" he cited his friends as saying.Human rights groups have warned that this practice has served both to punish protesters' families and obscure the true death toll.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMaia DaviesPA MediaKing Charles III met Helen Aronson, who survived the Nazis' Jewish ghetto in Lodz, Poland as a childKing Charles III and Queen Camilla have met Holocaust survivors and lit candles of remembrance at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.Survivors honoured for their services to holocaust awareness in a series of portraits commissioned by the King were welcomed to the Palace, including 100-year-old Anita Lasker-Wallfisch and 98-year-old Helen Aronson.King Charles said survivors who had died were also present \"in spirit\" at the reception to mark Holocaust Memorial Day.Earlier on Tuesday, Mala Tribich became the first holocaust survivor to address the cabinet - where she urged the government to \"do what needs to be done\" to tackle antisemitism today.Holocaust Memorial Day takes place on 27 January each year and remembers the six million Jewish people murdered during World War Two.It also commemorates the millions of people outside the Jewish faith who were murdered through Nazi persecution, and those targeted in more recent genocides.Survivors and their families were invited to the Palace on Tuesday to mark the anniversary, including the daughter and two-year-old grandson of Zigi Shipper, who died in 2023 aged 93.Shipper survived two concentration camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau in occupied Poland, a death march, and the Lodz ghetto - a Jewish ghetto established by the Nazis which was plagued by disease, starvation and forced labour.His daughter Lu Lawrence told the King she wished her father could have been present to see his \"magnificent\" portrait. King Charles responded that he was there \"in spirit\".The King, who last year became the first British head of state to visit Auschwitz, also told 100-year-old survivor Lasker-Wallfish that it was \"wonderful\" to have her join the reception.\"It goes back a long way since I first met you, it must be 20 years,\" he told her.The King and Queen Camilla were later handed candles to light by Rachel Levy, who survived both Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps.They spoke to youth ambassadors and charity workers, including the chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, and viewed a painting featuring excerpts from Anne Frank's diary.PA MediaMala Tribich survived Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in northern Germany, where tens of thousands of people were killedMeanwhile, 95-year-old Mala Tribich was welcomed to Downing Street by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as the first holocaust survivor \"ever to address the cabinet\".Tribich, who survived Bergen-Belsen as a 14-year-old and was made an MBE in 2012 for services to education, asked ministers in a five-minute speech not just to listen, but to become her \"witnesses\".\"We survivors never imagined we would witness antisemitism at the level it is today,\" she told ministers, some of whom became visibly emotional during the address.She said survivors had been \"shaken to the core\" by recent deadly attacks on Jewish people at a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar, and at a Hanukkah event in Sydney, Australia.Tribich asked: \"How, 81 years after the holocaust, can these people once again be targeted in this way?\"Remembering the past is no longer enough. I speak to you, leaders of this country I proudly call home, and I plead that you do what needs to be done.\"Her remarks received a standing ovation.Sir Keir thanked Tribich for her \"powerful words\" and said his government would do \"everything to tackle antisemitism wherever it reared its ugly head\".Holocaust Memorial Day sees people around the UK invited to light a candle in their windows to remember those who were killed and to stand against prejudice and hatred.Landmarks, buildings and monuments are set to be lit up in purple as part of the national Light the Darkness moment on Tuesday evening.The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust said the day mattered more than ever \"in a time when prejudice is alarmingly rising across our communities\".Dr Marcel Ladenheim, who was hidden by a French family during the Holocaust after his father was killed at Auschwitz, said he now felt \"worried\" for his children and grandchildren.The 86-year-old said the venue of an event he planned to attend on Tuesday had not been disclosed \"until very late for fear of a reaction, of mobs making a noise and making life very difficult for us\".He told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"It upsets me, for example, if I go to the synagogue... that we need security. It upsets me to see and hear that outside Jewish schools, there is security. We don't feel safe.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorRoberto Schmidt/GettyThe images emanating from Minneapolis have shocked ItaliansThe US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in a fatal shooting in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.Confirmation that a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would play a role came from several US departments, after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.\"This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,\" Milan Mayor Beppe Sala told Italian radio on Tuesday.Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, in a bid to cool tensions, told reporters \"it's not like the [Nazi] SS are coming\".He was speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony marking Holocaust Remembrance Day, attended by three Jewish Italians who survived the Holocaust.It is common for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and domestic law enforcement agencies to provide security support at major international events.DHS stressed that \"all security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities\".Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Tuesday that no ICE agents would appear on Italian streets, only officers from the police, the Carabinieri military police and the Guardia di Finanza financial authority.The interior ministry said later that the US would set up an operations room at its consulate in Milan, where relevant US agencies would work during the Games.US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if ICE had itself taken part.US officials said the role of Homeland Security Investigations - which is part of ICE - would be \"strictly supportive - working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations\".It would \"obviously\" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, homeland security department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the BBC.Antonio Tajani told reporters that the ICE agents who were coming were not \"those with machine guns and their faces covered... they're coming become it's the department responsible for counter-terrorism\".Piero CRUCIATTI/AFPItalian troops in Milan - the Winter Olympics at Milan-Cortina take place from 6-22 FebruaryItaly's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: \"I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.\"But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets. An ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good on 7 January in a Minneapolis street, prompting nationwide protests.And in the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot by US border patrol agents - from another DHS agency - on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide \"yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump\".The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that \"ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory\". The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.\"I believe [ICE agents] shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security,\" Beppe Sala told RTL radio.",

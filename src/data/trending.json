    "body": "9 hours agoLaura GozziGetty ImagesTiphaine Auzière is one of Brigitte Macron's three childrenBrigitte Macron's daughter has told a court in Paris that sexist cyber-bullying negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.Tiphaine Auzière, 41, is the step-daughter of French President Emmanuel Macron. She took the stand on the second and final day of the trial of 10 people accused of spreading unsubstantiated claims over Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality.Mrs Macron, 72, has long been the target of conspiracy theories which allege she is a transgender woman.\"It is important to be here today to express the harm my mother has faced. I wanted to give an account of what her life has been like since the moment she started being targeted by these attacks,\" Ms Auzière said. She added she had noticed a change and a \"deterioration\" in her mother's health since claims around her gender and sexuality began swirling. Mrs Macron \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... She knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories,\" Ms Auzière said. She said that not a day went by that the claims were not somehow reported to her mother - \"even by someone who means well and feels for her\". While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Ms Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.\"She hasn't been elected, she hasn't asked anything of anyone, and she comes under attack.\"Prosecutors are seeking suspended prison terms of three months to 12 months for the accused, and fines of up to €8,000 ($9,300). Getty ImagesBrigitte and Emmanuel Macron married in 2007, when he was 29 and she was 54Among the defendants - all aged 41 to 65 - are an elected official, a gallery owner and a teacher.One - a man named Aurélien Poirson-Atlan - is accused of telling his 200,000 online followers that Mrs Macron is a transgender woman and that the 24-year age gap between her and Emmanuel Macron amounts to \"state-sanctioned paedophilia\".Mr Poirson-Atlan told the court on Tuesday that he was a \"satirist\" who had just wished to put forward \"a point of view different to that of the mainstream media\". Two other defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were already found guilty of slander last year for claiming that France's first lady had never existed, and that her brother had changed gender and started using her name. They were later acquitted by a court of appeals.Other defendants also said they had employed their \"freedom of expression\". One requested the Macrons publish photos of Brigitte Macron pregnant to prove she is a biological woman. The Macrons have already said they will present such evidence in court proceedings against US right-wing influencer Candace Owens. Owens has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man and in March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation.Earlier this year the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, told the BBC the couple would present photographic and scientific evidence to a US court to prove Mrs Macron is a woman.\"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said.Mrs Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.The couple ended up marrying in 2007, when Mr Macron was 29 and Mrs Macron was 54.",

    "body": "1 hour agoGeorge WrightAFP via Getty ImagesHurricane Melissa is causing havoc in Jamaica as the Caribbean nation faces the strongest storm in its modern history.The hurricane, which weakened briefly Tuesday night before strengthening again to a category four storm with wind speeds of 130mph (209km/h), is heading towards Cuba and then the Bahamas. Earlier, Melissa made landfall on Jamaica's coastline with winds of more than 185mph.A Meteorological Service of Jamaica official had warned conditions would get \"significantly worse\" through the day and the US National Hurricane Center predicted \"catastrophic winds, flash flooding and storm surges\". Jamaican authorities urged residents and visitors to continue sheltering, as nearly a third of the country last power.Photos emerging from Jamaica since Hurricane Melissa made landfall show fallen trees and damaged homes.\"It's a catastrophic situation,\" the World Meteorological Organization's tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said at a press briefing, warning of storm surges up to four metres high.\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century, for sure.\"Roofs have been torn off hospitals, former Jamaican senator Imani Duncan-Price told the BBC.\"People are trying to rescue people in the middle of the storm just to save lives.\"Up to 30 inches (76cm) of rain is expected in some parts, with areas already experiencing flash flooding. Around 70% of the island's 2.8 million population lives within 5km of the sea.Jamaican PM Andrew Holness told CNN that he expects \"devastating impacts\". \"Reports that we have had so far would include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well,\" he told host Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night.The government has not received any new reports of storm-related deaths, Holness said, but given the strength of the storm, he is \"expecting that there would be some loss of life\".AFP via Getty ImagesWildlife is also a threat. Flooding may displace crocodiles from their natural dwellings, Jamaican health officials said.\"Rising water levels in rivers, gullies, and swamps could cause crocodiles to move into residential areas,\" the South East Regional Health Authority said in a statement.\"Residents living near these areas are therefore advised to remain vigilant and avoid flood waters.\"Winston Warren, who said he lives less than 1km from the ocean, described \"a constant roar of water\".\"There are times you just wonder - are the waves going to come crashing into your house?\" he said. \"We've seen a lot of roofs blown off.\"One woman told the BBC: \"There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\"EPAThe slow-moving storm is expected to remain powerful as it crosses Jamaica, whose highland communities are vulnerable to landslides and flooding.Even before the eye of the hurricane reached land, the region experienced extreme weather and fatalities. On Monday, Jamaica's government said three people had died in \"storm-related\" incidents, involving falling trees.The storm is heading towards Santiago de Cuba, Cuba's second-largest city. The NHC's latest Tuesday night advisory tracked the hurricane about 110 miles (177km) southwest of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In Cuba, authorities said they evacuated about 500,000 people from areas vulnerable to winds and flooding.\"Melissa will arrive with force, and there's great concern about what it could destroy in its wake,\" Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said in a message published in state newspaper Granma.Additional reporting by Brandon Drenon and Gabriela Pomeroy",

    "body": "Australian authorities are investigating after an 80-year-old woman who was left behind on a Great Barrier Reef island by a cruise ship was found dead.The woman had been hiking on Lizard Island, 250 km (155 miles) north of Cairns, with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer cruise ship on Saturday but is believed to have broken off from the group to have a rest.The ship left the island around sunset but returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing. A major search operation found the woman's body on Sunday morning.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said it is investigating and will meet the ship's crew when it docks in Darwin later this week.A spokesperson for AMSA said it was first alerted to the missing woman at around 21:00 local time on Saturday (05:00 GMT on Friday) by the ship's captain.The authority said it would work with other relevant agencies to investigate the case and that it takes the safety of passengers and crew onboard commercial vessels seriously.Coral Expeditions chief executive Mark Fifield said staff have contacted the woman's family and were offering support over the \"tragic death\".\"While investigations into the incident are continuing, we are deeply sorry that this has occurred and are offering our full support to the woman's family,\" Fifield said.The elderly Australian woman is understood to have joined a group hike to the island's highest peak, Cook's Look, before she decided she needed to rest, according to the Courier Mail.Traci Ayris was sailing near the island last weekend and told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that she saw a helicopter using a spotlight to search a walking trail on the island at around midnight on Saturday. She said about seven people with torches went to the island to search but it was called off at around 03:00 local time with a helicopter returning on Sunday morning when the body was found.\"We knew she was dead because they called everyone back from the search immediately,\" she told the ABC.\"And no-one went to the spot that the chopper was hovering over until later that day when the police arrived.\"Ayris said the incident was clearly distressing for crew and passengers.\"It was very sad in this paradise to have this tragedy occur. It should have been a happy time for that lovely lady.\"It is understood the woman was on the first stop of a 60-day cruise around Australia, with tickets costing in the tens of thousands of dollars for the journey.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Queensland police said a report will be prepared for the coroner in the \"sudden and non-suspicious death\" of the woman.

    "body": "5 hours agoMimi SwabyGlobal affairs reporterAt least 64 people were killed in a police operation against the Red Command gang in Rio de Janeiro's northern suburbs - the largest and deadliest raid in the Brazilian state's history.Four police officers were among those killed during Operation Containment in the Alemão and Penha districts, state Governor Cláudio Castro said. More than 80 people were arrested.Fierce clashes erupted when about 2,500 security personnel moved in on Tuesday morning. The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) responded with gunfire, burning barricades and dropping bombs from drones, officials said. The UN Human Rights Office said it was \"horrified\" by the police operation, urging \"prompt and effective investigations\".The area of favelas near Rio's airport is considered to be the headquarters of one of Brazil's most powerful organised crime groups.State officials said at least 50 of those killed were \"indicated by police as suspected of being criminals\".Dozens of people were injured, including civilians caught in the crossfire.Locals have likened the hillside area - home to about 300,000 people - to a \"war zone\" since the operation began.Roads remain closed throughout the region.The Red Command group have been expanding their territory across the Rio state, increasing drug trafficking routes and control of the hillside favelas.Rio's police said more than 200kg (441lb) of drugs were seized in the raid, along with dozens of firearms.The joint operation by civil and military police comes after a year-long investigation.Dozens of the suspects are thought to be members of a faction from the Pará state who are currently hiding in Rio de Janeiro.Large-scale police operations are not uncommon in Brazil ahead of major international events in the South American nation.

    "body": "4 hours agoDanielle KayeBusiness reporterEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockAmazon's move this week to slash thousands of corporate jobs fed into a longstanding anxiety: that Artificial Intelligence is starting to replace workers.The tech giant joined a growing list of companies in the US that have pointed to AI technology as a reason behind layoffs.But some question whether AI is fully to blame - and have voiced scepticism that recent high-profile layoffs are a telling sign of the technology's effect on employment.Chegg, the online education firm, cited the \"new realities\" of AI as it announced a 45% reduction in workforce on Monday. When Salesforce cut 4,000 customer service roles last month, its chief executive said AI agents were doing the work.UPS said on Tuesday that it has cut 48,000 jobs since last year. The delivery company's chief executive previously linked redundancies, in part, to machine learning.But extrapolating from executives' remarks during cuts is \"possibly the worst way\" to determine the effects of AI on jobs, said Martha Gimbel, executive director of the Budget Lab at Yale University.Company-specific dynamics, she said, are often at play.\"There is a real tendency, because everyone is so freaked out about the possible impact of AI on the labour market moving forward, to overreact to individual company announcements,\" Ms Gimbel said.Certain subsets of the workforce - recent college graduates and data centre employees, for example - in fact are particularly vulnerable to the technology's adoption.A recent study from the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis found a correlation between occupations with a higher prevalence of AI and increases in unemployment since 2022.But Morgan Frank, assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has studied unemployment risk by occupation and found that the only workers affected by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 were in the office and administrative support sector.For them, their probability of claiming unemployment jumped in early 2023, he said - immediately following the entrance of the chat bot developed by OpenAI.But for computer and maths occupations, \"there is no discernible change in the trend around the launch of ChatGPT\", he said.\"Both tech workers and admin workers - they're in a rougher job market than they were in a couple years ago,\" Mr Frank said.\"I'd be sceptical that AI is the reason for all of it, though,\" he added.'Typical patterns' of hiring and firingAmazon and many of its rivals in the tech sector hired at a rapid clip in the years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic and in the pandemic's early months, when the Federal Reserve lowered US interest rates to near zero.The hiring set these firms up for eventual workforce reductions, experts said - a dynamic separate from the generative AI boom over the last three years.The Fed also started hiking interest rates around the time that ChapGPT was launched.\"A lot of this conversation feels very different to people because the phrase AI is in it,\"said Ms Gimbel, of the Budget Lab.\"But so far, nothing that I've seen looks different than typical patterns of companies hiring and firing, particularly at this point in an economic cycle.\"A big question, she added, is what hiring patterns look like when the economy returns to a period of solid growth.In the long run, Ms Gimbel said, breaking out the cyclical versus AI-driven job losses will be crucial. If, for instance, the US economy were to fall into a recession, human resources and marketing jobs would be the expected casualties. Those jobs, though, also happen to be exposed to AI, complicating the task of identifying whether the cuts are a result of macroeconomic conditions or the technology's adoption - or both.Amazon at the forefrontAmazon, which confirmed it plans to cut roughly 14,000 corporate roles, said it needs to be \"organised more leanly\" to seize the opportunity provided by AI.The company has been performing well. It reported quarterly results in July that beat Wall Street expectations on several counts, including a 13% year over year increase in sales to $167.7bn (£125bn).Enrico Moretti, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that the largest tech companies like Amazon are at the forefront of AI-related job cuts, \"in part because they're both producers and consumers of AI\".Still, he acknowledged that a correction following robust hiring during the pandemic also may have driven the company's latest round of layoffs.Amazon is likely able to automate jobs faster than most of its rivals because of its scale, said Lawrence Schmidt, an associate professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management.\"It's not at all crazy to think that Amazon might want to shed certain types of roles, or refrain from hiring additional people in certain types of roles, if they can be quickly automated,\" Mr Schmidt said.\"Regardless of what happens to counts of jobs overall,\" he added, \"you would expect there to be reallocation.\"",

    "body": "29 minutes agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe co-founder of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's says that its parent company Unilever blocked it from launching an ice cream flavour that expressed \"solidarity with Palestine\".Ben Cohen announced that he will independently create the new flavour as part of a personal series highlighting causes the company has been barred from addressing publicly.Ben & Jerry's is known for its activism on social issues and has consistently spoken out on political, environmental and humanitarian matters - including the Israel-Gaza conflict.The BBC has contacted Unilever for comment.Mr Cohen's statement deepens the long-drawn dispute between the world-famous ice cream maker and Unilever, the British packaged goods giant which has owned Ben & Jerry's since 2000.The co-founders said Unilever and its ice cream arm Magnum, which is being spun off from its parent company, had unlawfully blocked their company from \"honouring its social mission\".Mr Cohen said in an Instagram video on Tuesday that he is creating a new watermelon-flavoured sorbet, calling for ideas for the product's name and what ingredients should be added.The watermelon has become a symbol for solidarity with Palestinians due to its colours, which are similar to those of the Palestinian flag – red, green, black and white. The American entrepreneur said Ben & Jerry's were prevented by Unilever from creating the dessert.\"I'm doing what they couldn't,\" Mr Cohen says from his set in a kitchen. \"I'm making a watermelon-flavoured ice cream that calls for permanent peace in Palestine and calls for repairing the damage that was done there.\"In 2021, Ben & Jerry's refused to sell its products in areas occupied by Israel. Its Israeli operation was sold by Unilever to a local licensee, allowing its ice cream to continue being sold in the occupied West Bank.The dessert series will be developed under Ben's Best, Mr Cohen's activist ice cream brand, he said in a statement to the press. The flavour is being produced independently of Ben & Jerry's, the statement said.Ben's Best was first setup in 2016 to support former US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, with the flavour \"Bernie's Back\". Mr Cohen said he will develop other ice cream flavours that speak to the issues Ben & Jerry's was silenced from addressing publicly by Unilever.In September, co-founder Jerry Greenfield stepped down from Ben & Jerry's after decades at the company, citing concerns that its independence had been compromised following Unilever's decision to curb its social activism.At the time, Ben Cohen said that \"Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it.\"\"My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years,\" he told the BBC's PM programme.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura Gozzi,London and Abdujalil Abdurasulov,WarsawRussian troops are making a concerted push in eastern Ukraine and have gained a foothold in the strategic hub of Pokrovsk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says. Moscow's soldiers outnumber Kyiv's 8-1 in the area and Ukraine cannot match that, Zelensky added while insisting Russia had not yet \"achieved the planned result\". Russia has been trying to capture Pokrovsk for two years. The key supply and transport hub provides supplies and reinforcements to the eastern front - and it would get Moscow closer to occupying the entirety of the Donetsk region. It would also put towns of the heavily fortified \"fortress belt\" - Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Kostyantynivka and Druzhkivka - within easier reach of Moscow. Zelensky said drone imagery showed that around 200 Russian soldiers were inside Pokrovsk. Describing the situation as \"difficult\", he said earlier that there was widespread fierce fighting and \"sabotage groups\" had entered the town. However, he rejected reports by Russia's Chief of General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that Ukrainian troops had been completely surrounded. In an update on Tuesday, Russia's defence ministry said its forces had encircled Ukrainian troops around the main railway station and cleared the city's Troyanda district of Ukrainian forces.One soldier from Ukraine's 155th Brigade, Artem Pribylnov, rejected the notion that Ukrainian troops had been encircled in a \"cauldron\" at Pokrovsk.\"But the war has changed and it's very technological now,\" he said. In previous assaults there had been a path out of the cauldron that troops could drive in and out of, he said, but now drones controlled access points, which made it \"extremely dangerous\".\"Perhaps that's why Russians claim they've encircled Pokrovsk even if there is no physical encirclement of the city?\" he suggested.According to Capt Hryhoriy Shapoval, spokesperson of Ukraine's East operational group, 79 attacks had been repelled near Pokrovsk since Monday - almost a third of the total 218 assaults recorded across the entire front line.He said that Russian troops had concentrated a large number of troops and equipment near Pokrovsk and that they were using armoured vehicles to cover their infantry. \"So it's hard to stop them,\" he said.He added that Kyiv's troops normally used drones to counter the Russians' advance but foggy and rainy weather conditions had made it harder to detect and destroy infantry troops.The situation in and around Pokrovsk exemplifies the high cost of shifting the front line forward, even just by a few metres. Last week, Ukrainian media reported that Russian forces were engaging in street battles and targeting Ukrainian positions, including drone operators.Away from the towns, drone technology means both Russian and Ukrainian forces are able to pound one another deep on either side of the front line.Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 is almost into its fifth year. Moscow's troops currently occupy about 20% of Ukrainian territory. Kyiv's defence capabilities are shrinking and Zelensky has said Ukraine needs  financial support from its European allies to continue fighting Russian forces for another two or three years. European leaders have so far failed to divert €140bn worth of Russian frozen assets to Ukraine - a move which would require complex legal machinations and which was blocked by Belgium at an EU summit last week. The proposal will be revisited in December.Zelensky said he had told his European counterparts that while Ukraine was \"not going to fight for decades... you must show that for some time you will be able to provide stable financial support to Ukraine\".The Ukrainian president also said he hoped a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday would result in a decision by China to cut its support for Russia. Last week Trump slapped Lukoil and Rosneft - two major Russian oil companies - with sanctions, and urged Turkey and China to halt purchases of Russian oil in a bid to put economic pressure on the Kremlin.\"I think this may be one of [Trump's] strong moves, especially if, following this decisive sanctions step, China is ready to reduce imports\" from Russia, Zelensky told journalists earlier this week.",

    "body": "Israeli strikes kill 33 in Gaza, Hamas-run civil defence says, as Trump insists ceasefire remains59 minutes agoDavid Gritten,Jerusalem and Rushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, in IstanbulWatch: Explosions seen in Gaza after Netanyahu orders strikesAt least 33 Palestinians were killed in a series of Israeli air strikes in Gaza, according to the territory's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency and hospital officials. Israel carried out the strikes in response to what it said were violations of the US-brokered ceasefire agreement.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday, and breaching the terms on returning the bodies of deceased hostages. Hamas claimed it had \"no connection\" to the attack and insisted it was committed to the ceasefire deal.US leader Donald Trump maintained \"nothing\" would jeopardise the ceasefire, but added that Israel \"should hit back\" if its soldiers were targeted.Anadolu via Getty ImagesFour people were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City's Sabra neighbourhoodThe Israeli strikes hit homes, schools and residential blocks in Gaza City, Beit Lahia, al-Bureij, Nuseirat and Khan Younis.A spokesman for Gaza's Civil Defence agency told the BBC that rescue teams were \"working amid extremely difficult conditions due to continuous bombing and lack of equipment\".\"Some of the missing are still under the rubble, and we fear the death toll will rise,\" he said.A brief statement put out by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Tuesday evening said he had ordered \"forceful strikes\" by the military but did not specify his reasons.However, Katz said Hamas had crossed \"a bright red line\" by launching an attack on Israeli soldiers in Gaza on Tuesday.\"Hamas will pay many times over for attacking the soldiers and for violating the agreement to return the fallen hostages,\" he warned.An Israeli military official said the Hamas attack took place \"east of the Yellow Line\", which demarcates Israeli-controlled territory inside Gaza under the ceasefire deal.Israeli media reported that troops in the southern Gaza city of Rafah had come under anti-tank missile and sniper fire on Tuesday afternoon, while Palestinian media reported Israeli artillery shelling in the area at the same time.After the Israeli military carried out air strikes in Gaza on Tuesday evening, witnesses reported powerful explosions in several parts of the territory, including Gaza City in the north and Khan Younis in the south.A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency told the BBC that four people, including three women, were among those killed when a home belonging to the al-Banna family was bombed in the southern Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City.Strikes also reportedly hit a courtyard of al-Shifa hospital, in the western Rimal area.The Civil Defence spokesman said another five people were killed, including two children and a woman, when a vehicle was hit on al-Qassam Street in Khan Younis.Hamas issued a statement denying that its fighters had attacked Israeli troops and condemning the Israeli strikes.\"Hamas affirms that it has no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah and affirms its commitment to the ceasefire agreement,\" it said.\"The criminal bombardment carried out by the fascist occupation [Israeli] army on areas of the Gaza Strip represents a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement.\"The group's military wing meanwhile said it would postpone the return of a hostage's body it had recovered on Tuesday due to what it called Israeli \"violations\".US Vice-President Vance told reporters in Washington: \"The ceasefire is holding. That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes here and there.\"\"We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an [Israeli] soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond, but I think the president's peace is going to hold despite that,\" he added.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians try to clear the rubble of destroyed buildings in Khan Younis, southern GazaEarlier, Israel's prime minister had pledged to take unspecified \"steps\" against Hamas after the group handed over a coffin containing human remains on Monday night that did not belong to one of the 13 deceased hostages still in Gaza.Netanyahu's office said forensic tests showed they belonged to Ofir Tzarfati, an Israeli hostage whose body was recovered by Israeli forces in Gaza in late 2023, and that this constituted a \"clear violation\" of the ceasefire deal.The Israeli military also released footage from a drone that it said showed Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" in eastern Gaza City on Monday.\"Shortly afterwards,\" it added, the operatives \"summoned representatives of the Red Cross and staged a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"Hamas rejected what it called the \"baseless allegations\" and accused Israel of \"seeking to fabricate false pretexts in preparation for taking new aggressive steps\".In a statement later the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) condemned what it called the \"fake recovery\", saying it had attended the scene \"at the request of Hamas\" and \"in good faith\".It went on: \"The ICRC team at this location were not aware that a deceased person had been placed there prior to their arrival, as seen in the footage – in general, our role as neutral intermediary does not include unearthing of the bodies of the deceased. \"Our team only observed what appeared to be the recovery of remains without prior knowledge of the circumstances leading up to it. \"It is unacceptable that a fake recovery was staged, when so much depends on this agreement being upheld and when so many families are still anxiously awaiting news of their loved ones.\"ReutersThe ceasefire agreement brokered by the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey is supposed to implement the first stage of President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan.It said Hamas would return its 48 living and deceased hostages within 72 hours of the ceasefire taking effect on 10 October.All 20 living Israeli hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Israel has also handed over the bodies of 195 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 13 Israeli hostages so far returned by Hamas, along with those of two foreign hostages - one of them Thai and the other Nepalese.Eleven of the dead hostages still in Gaza are Israelis, one is Tanzanian, and one is Thai.On Saturday, Hamas's chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya said the group was facing challenges because Israeli forces had \"altered the terrain of Gaza\". He also said that \"some of those who buried the bodies have been martyred or no longer remember where they buried them\".However, the Israeli government insists Hamas knows the locations of all the bodies.All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 68,530 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "Fear of mass killings as thousands trapped in besieged Sudan city taken by militia group11 hours agoBasillioh Rukanga and Akisa Wandera,BBC AfricaFears are mounting of mass killings in the key Sudanese city of el-Fasher after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured it from government forces. In a address on Monday evening, Sudan's military chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said he had approved the withdrawal of troops in response to the \"systematic destruction and killing of civilians\".The UN said there were credible reports of \"summary executions\", while Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab referred to satellite imagery of \"piles of bodies executed en masse\".The RSF has denied accusations of killing civilians and targeting non-Arab ethnic groups, despite evidence presented by the UN and human rights organisations.The fall of el-Fasher in the Darfur region could mark a significant turning point in Sudan's civil war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since April 2023.RSF fighters had been besieging el-Fasher for 18 months, trapping hundreds of thousands of civilians in the city and sparking a hunger crisis. El-Fasher siege: My son's whole body is full of shrapnel'A pregnant woman's diary of escape from war zoneYale University's Humanitarian Research Lab told the BBC that since the city was captured, satellite images have shown \"piles of bodies executed en masse, or shot by snipers attempting to breach\" the city's perimeter wall.And in a post on X, the research group's executive director described his shock at being able to see \"apparent pools of blood\" via satellite imagery.\"The horror, scale, and velocity of killing happening now [is] unlike anything I've ever seen in a quarter century of doing this work,\" Nathaniel Raymond said.Similarly, a UN humanitarian team in Sudan said it was \"horrified\" by reports of atrocities like \"summary executions\", attacks on civilians along escape routes, sexual violence and house-to-house raids.The Joint Force, an alliance of Darfuri armed groups supporting the military, said 2,000 civilians had been killed since the city fell. There is no independent confirmation of this. Meanwhile, residents who managed to flee el-Fasher have told the BBC they are fearful and distressed after losing contact with relatives still stuck in the city.One man said several of his relatives were \"massacred\", but he has not been able to contact any surviving members of his family as communication lines have been cut since the RSF took over.\"They were gathered in one place and all killed. Now we have no idea what has happened to those who are still alive,\" he said.On Tuesday, the European Union said it wanted \"all warring parties to de-escalate\" the conflict, while the African Union condemned \"alleged war crimes and ethnically targeted killings of civilians\".The World Health Organization (WHO) said the only hospital still functioning, albeit partially, in el-Fasher was attacked on Sunday.A nurse was reportedly killed in the assault, it added.UN head Antonio Guterres said he was \"gravely concerned\" over the current situation in the city, and condemned the reported \"violations of international humanitarian law\".On Monday, after confirming the army had withdrawn from el-Fasher, Sudanese military chief Gen Burhan denounced inaction by the international community to end the RSF's atrocities and vowed to fight \"until this land is purified\".\"We can turn the tables every time, and we can return every land desecrated by these traitors to the nation's fold,\" he said.",

    "body": "11 hours agoRachel Hagan and Mark Poynting,Climate ReporterStrong winds and wild waves in Kingston, JamaicaA very powerful hurricane has made landfall in Jamaica and is the strongest storm to hit the Caribbean island in modern history.Hurricane Melissa, now a Category 4 storm, first hit the island's southern coast with maximum sustained winds of 295km/h (185mph) - the strongest on Earth so far this year.Those speeds are above those of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, one of the worst storms in US history.For a nation already living on the front lines of a changing climate, the threat is grave.So why is this particular hurricane so dangerous?Follow live updatesHow Melissa became a Category 5 monsterTropical Storm Melissa took shape last Tuesday before rapidly strengthening as it moved west through the Caribbean.A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface and creates a spinning system of clouds and storms. In the centre, air sinks, creating the eye, a calm, cloud-free zone surrounded by a wall of violent winds and rain known as the eye-wall.Melissa's origins trace back to a cluster of thunderstorms off the coast of West Africa in mid-October. By 21 October it had reached tropical storm strength and by 26 October, it was a Category 4 beast churning through the Caribbean Sea.Ocean temperatures in the Caribbean are unusually high this year and hurricanes feed off that warm layer of water. Those conditions allowed Melissa to intensify quickly.\"The ocean is warmer and the atmosphere is warmer and moister because of [climate change],\" says Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami.\"So it tips the scale in favour of things like rapid intensification [where wind speeds increase very quickly], higher peak intensity, and increased rainfall.\"Low pressure and violent windsMelissa ranks as one of the strongest storms in the Atlantic this century.For Jamaicans, the comparisons with past storms are chilling. If it strikes Jamaica at close to full strength, it could eclipse all the storms the island has experienced before. Gilbert in 1988, the last direct hit, was a Category 3. It destroyed thousands of homes and killed 49 people. Dean in 2007 and Beryl in 2024 came close, but neither matched Melissa's power.The storm's central air pressure dropped to 892 millibars as of the National Hurricane Center's advisory on Tuesday morning local time, below Hurricane Katrina's 902 mb. The lower the pressure, the more violent the winds - making this one of the most powerful systems ever to form in the Atlantic.Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, killed 1,392 people and caused damage estimated at $125bn (£94bn).\"This is going to be the strongest hurricane that's ever hit [Jamaica], at least in the records we have,\" Dr Fred Thomas, a research software engineer at Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, told the BBC.The storm has been blamed for four deaths in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Jamaica's minister of health said on Monday that three people had died on the island while preparing for the approaching storm.Melissa strengthened particularly quickly, fuelled by very warm waters in the Caribbean, around one to two degrees above average.\"There has been a perfect storm of conditions leading to the colossal strength of Hurricane Melissa,\" Dr Leanne Archer, research associate in climate extremes at the University of Bristol, said.Slow pace poses catastrophic flooding riskWhile the wind speed is staggeringly high, the storm's movement is notably slow. Melissa itself was crawling westward at around 5km/h on Tuesday- slower than a person's walking pace.That lethargy, meteorologists warn, could be catastrophic as it means that a hurricane can bring rain to a single location for days on end, aggravating flooding.When hurricanes stall, they linger over one area for far longer than normal, leading to repeated waves of rain, flooding and wind damage.One of the most famous examples of this is Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which stalled over Houston in the US. Harvey released 100cm of rain in just three days, causing catastrophic flooding.The US National Hurricane Center has warned that Jamaica could see 38 to 76 cm of rain, with as much as a metre in some mountainous areas.Storm surges of up to four metres are possible, especially along the island's southern and eastern shores. Low-lying parishes such as Clarendon and St Catherine are at risk of flash flooding not only from rainfall but also from torrents rushing down from the Blue Mountains.\"Imagine a metre of rainfall coming down in a whole basin and then being channelled down into a river network. That's going to be metres and metres of flooding by the time it reaches the lower parts of that drainage network. So the flooding will probably result in a large loss of life, I imagine,\" Dr Thomas, who visited Jamaica earlier this year, said.ReutersAs a low-lying island nation, it is particularly exposed to stormsSome research suggests hurricanes are generally moving more slowly than they used to. That means more storms like Melissa can sit, rather than sweep, over the land they hit.And some scientists believe that might be to do with how climate change is affecting circulation patterns in our atmosphere, but that is far from certain and natural variability may also be playing a role.Jamaica 'unprepared'Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness has already warned that \"no infrastructure can withstand a Category 5\".Dr Thomas largely agrees, but explained that most new buildings in Jamaica were made of reinforced concrete, as required by national building codes.\"Anything built to that code should be pretty strong in terms of the wind, but the wind has only one impact,\" he said. \"The frightening thing about Melissa is not just the wind - it's the rain and the storm surge. You could have your whole ground floor completely inundated and then part of the first floor as well.\"In major cities like Kingston and Montego Bay, the construction is more robust, he said, but in rural and hillside areas, \"there's more vernacular architecture [some things built from wood] not the larger, concrete-type buildings\". Those will fare far worse.\"This hurricane will be very hard on Jamaica,\" says Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus of atmospheric science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Jamaica is \"unprepared to cope effectively\" with major storms, Dr Patricia Green, an architect and preservationist based in Kingston told the BBC. She recalled how \"a couple of hours of rainfall\" in September caused \"massive flooding\" in the capital, exposing deep weaknesses in urban planning.She criticised the surge of high-rise developments \"sited in areas that should be the runoff of the city\", saying they had brought flooding to districts \"that never had flooding before\".As a low-lying island nation, it is particularly exposed to storms. About 70% of the population resides in coastal areas, according to data from the Jamaican government.And as is the case with extreme weather, poorer communities are expected to be most badly affected.\"This is one of those worst-case scenarios that you prepare for but desperately hope never happen,\" says Hannah Cloke, professor of hydrology at the University of Reading.\"The whole country will have a deep and permanent scar from this beast of a storm. It will be a long and exhausting recovery for those affected.\"Tourism is another concern. Jamaica's big resorts are largely made from concrete, but their strength has never been tested by winds of this magnitude.Other parts of the country's infrastructure are more exposed, with electricity expected to go out. Dr Thomas said: \"The grid will probably take areas offline before the worst of the storm. But then you've got poles and lines brought down by debris and trees. It's often not the wind itself, but what the wind picks up.\"Beyond the buildings, the storm threatens Jamaica's power, water and transport networks. Fallen trees and flying debris are expected to down power lines. Flooding could overwhelm sewage systems and contaminate water supplies. Landslides are likely to cut off mountain roads, isolating rural communities.Dr Green said modern architectural trends are worsening resilience and the move from traditional jalousie windows with slats to fixed glass can leave buildings more exposed. The sealed panes prevent air from passing through, increasing pressure inside and making walls and roofs more likely to fall when storms strike.The most vulnerable, she added, are the poorer communities, particularly those living along riverbanks and gullies, which Dr Green says is a \"historical, colonial issue\", tracing back to emancipation, when formerly enslaved people were granted marginal lands. Many of these families, she said, have lived there for generations, without affordable alternatives or secure land titles.Dr Thomas pointed particularly to Port Royal which is a small fishing village in Kingston, considered one of the most hurricane-vulnerable communities and on the compulsory evacuation list.He visited in February, explaining: \"It's sort of a long spit of land and it's extremely exposed with a seven or eight-mile drive back to the mainland, so it could be quite easily cut off.\"The ripple effects of any one failure can be wide: \"Power goes out, and then telecommunications go. Hospitals have backup for a while, but often not long enough. And the airport's closed, which means aid can't get in quickly.\"With airports closed, supply chains disrupted and aid flights grounded, even after the storm passes, recovery may take months. ",

    "body": "5 hours agoLaura BickerSeoulBBCProtesters gathered in Seoul ahead of Trump's arrival on Wednesday\"No Trump!\" the rally of hundreds shouted, growing louder as it neared the United States embassy in the centre of South Korea's capital Seoul.A line of police buses stopped them reaching the gates, but a stage and loudspeaker ensured their voices would soar above Gwanghwamun square and within earshot of US President Donald Trump's representatives.This was a small rally by the standards of South Korea's vibrant protest culture. And it was not the only one under way. A few hundred metres to the north, at the gates of Gyeongbokgung palace, marchers held aloft more banners as they chanted a very different message.\"No China,\" along with a smattering of \"CCP [Chinese Communist Party] out!\". Again, the numbers - several hundred people - were not huge for South Korea.Nevertheless, this footfall through central Seoul on a sunny Saturday is an indication of the diplomatic dance South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung will have to perform this week as he hosts the leaders of both the US and China.Seoul is - and has long been - a key US ally. A friendship \"forged in blood\", as its leaders often say, during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, when American troops helped repel the North Korean invasion. The South still needs Washington's protection, but it also needs China, its biggest trading partner and a vital market for exports.\"It's a particularly fraught moment - South Korea finds itself caught between a rock and a hard place,\" says Darcie Draudt-Vejares, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\"Year after year it is epitomising the choice of many countries worldwide that are deeply economically integrated with China, but also economically integrated with the US. Right now, Lee Jae-myung is trying to manoeuvre between these superpowers.\"So much so that his country is even hosting talks between Trump and Xi Jinping on Thursday that may well yield a breakthrough in their on-again-off-again trade war.A lot on the lineAt 61, Lee is a seasoned politician, but he has his work cut out for him.His emphatic victory in June followed six months of turmoil. His predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law order triggered huge protests and a constitutional crisis that eventually led to his impeachment, but left the country polarised.By the time Lee took office, Trump's tariffs had stunned both allies and rivals. Negotiations began and in August, Lee visited the White House and turned on the charm. It seemed to work.South Korea thought it had appeased its powerful friend. Seoul said it would invest $350bn in the US and buy $100bn worth of liquified natural gas. In return, Trump agreed to lower tariffs from 25% to 15%.Getty ImagesLee Jae Myung with Trump at a meeting in the White House in AugustBut then more than 300 South Koreans were detained in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in the US state of Georgia. Nearly all of them have since returned, but that has shaken ties - especially because Hyundai is a major investor in the US.\"I don't think the relationship between the US and Korea is necessarily broken at this point,\" said 23-year-old Hye-yeon Lee as the protest outside the US embassy came to an end.\"Although I do think it is being eroded significantly,\" she added.The White House has also increased its demands as part of the trade talks - Trump is now pushing for cash investments in the US. Despite attempts to get a deal signed, there is no final agreement and hopes of reaching one when the two leaders meet on Wednesday are not high.\"South Korea has a huge amount on the line in terms of their prosperity and their security with this visit, but in a funny way, the less time Donald Trump is here could be better for President Lee Jae-myung,\" says John Delury, a senior fellow at the Asia Society's Centre on US-China relations.\"It doesn't look like they're near a breakthrough on their trade agreement. And so, if Trump comes, has his meetings, they go well, and he's out of here in 24 hours, that's not a terrible outcome as far as South Korea is concerned.\"And there is clearly also anger and disillusionment, some of it driven by Trump's contentious personal brand of politics. Hence the protests, where 22-year-old college student Kim Sol-yi was carrying a banner depicting a cartoon Trump vomiting money.\"When he called South Korea a 'money machine' that really angered me,\" she said. \"It seems the US is seeing and treating South Korea as its cash cow – plain and simple – asking for huge investments. Honestly, it makes me pretty mad and question whether the US even thinks of us as an equal partner.\"The protests are not huge by South Korean standardsAnd yet South Koreans' views of the US appear to be largely positive. Nearly nine out of 10 view the US as their most important ally, according to a poll taken earlier this year by the US-based Pew Research Centre. But the survey happened before the raids in Georgia.That poll was not so favourable towards South Korea's other superpower guest this week: China, whom a third of respondents viewed as their country's biggest threat.The China conundrum\"I came out here today out of love for South Korea, to protect South Korea,\" said 27-year-old Park Da-som, who was at the other protest, rallying against China.\"I feel that the Republic of Korea is gradually being overtaken by Chinese influences,\" she adds, but with a pragmatic caveat.\"Of course, I believe we should maintain a certain level of favourable diplomatic relations with China. What we dislike is the CCP - the Chinese Communist Party.\"Anti-Chinese sentiment in South Korea has grown steadily since 2016 when Seoul agreed to deploy an advanced US missile defence system in the country, which prompted economic retaliation from a furious Beijing. There are also historic grievances and theirs has always been an uneasy relationship.But the mistrust has intensified on the right in a country divided  by Yoon's impeachment. Chinese interference became a common trope in conspiracy theories about Yoon being a victim of election fraud.While tens of thousands demanded his removal from office, his supporters, far smaller in number but vociferous, opposed his impeachment – even now a fringe group of conservatives regularly call for his return. They are also the ones rallying against China.\"Korea for Koreans\" read the banners at the weekend protests, along with signs calling on the government to \"Stop the Chinese Boats\". One café  is facing criticism after posting online that it would refuse to serve Chinese customers.Such instances have led to allegations of racism but Soo-bin, 27, who was at the protests, disagreed: \"We value democratic freedom and the free market economy. We want a Republic of Korea where all freedom - freedom of association, assembly, religion, expression - are protected. That is why we stand here.\"Anti-Chinese sentiment has been on the rise in South Korea Observers say this is a minority view, represented by a small part of the Korean electorate. Yet it it's hard to deny that there has been a small surge in anti-Chinese rhetoric recently after President Lee eased visa rules for Chinese tourist groups.Lee has tried to curb the protests by introducing a bill banning rallies that promote hatred or discrimination. And long known for his openness to pursue stronger ties with China, he has made it clear that's what he intends to do in office.Xi Jinping is set to meet Lee one-on-one on Saturday during what is his first visit to South Korea in 11 years, despite it being a short hop from Beijing.\"If President Lee can deliver on the economic side, everyone will give him a pass, except for what is ultimately a pretty fringe position on what you could say is the far-right,\" Mr Delury says. \"President Lee is really governing more toward the centre, and the centre of Korea wants to get along with China.\"Hardball with superpowersXi arrives on Thursday and, after meeting Trump, he is spending three days in the ancient capital of Gyeongju with other leaders attending the APEC summit. He is spending more time in South Korea than Trump, which is a huge diplomatic opportunity as he seeks to present China as the more stable trading partner and global power.A better relationship with Beijing – ties soured under Yoon, who was seen as hawkish towards China – could also help President Lee start a conversation with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.This is also a dialogue that he and his Democratic Party have pushed for – the earlier historic summits between Trump and Kim also happened with the help of a South Korean leader from the same party.Could that happen this time? The US president has said he wants to talk, but there has been no reply from Pyongyang.South Korea is one of the world's biggest soft powers at the momentKim aside, this is a big week for South Korea and Lee. It's hard to miss America's influence on the country, from music to religion, but South Korea is now a wealthy, soft-power giant with a voice of its own.The streets bustle with westerners in traditional Korean Hanbok hunting for merchandise from the Netflix hit K-pop Demon Hunters or queuing in K-beauty shops for the hottest new face masks. The economy has been picking up speed again.However Lee chooses to navigate between the world's two biggest economies, it's hard to imagine how he can afford to alienate either.",

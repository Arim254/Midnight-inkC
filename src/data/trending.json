    "body": "1 hour agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonSwiss prosecutors say the French managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people have been placed under criminal investigation.The blaze at Le Constellation in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve injured 119 other people, officials have said. With many of the injured identified, families now face an agonising wait for information about those still missing.The bodies of two Swiss women aged 21 and 16, and two Swiss men aged 18 and 16 were the first to be indentified and returned to their families, police said earlier.The likely cause of the fire was sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation of how the fire began found. The French managers of Le Constellation are suspected of having committed homicide by negligence, causing bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in the canton of Valais said in a statement on Saturday afternoon.Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin called it \"one of the worst tragedies\" experienced by the country.Further details about the identified victims, including names, have not been released.On Friday, police said 113 of the injured have been identified, and include 71 Swiss, 14 French and 11 Italian citizens.Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16.A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process was continuing on Saturday and should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "Two die and sea search for third person called offJust nowEmma Petrie,East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire,Jessica LaneandKevin Shoesmith,in WithernseaDarrin StevensTwo people have died and a third person is missing after a major search and rescue operation off the East Yorkshire coast.An eyewitness described how people entered the water at Withernsea to try and save a young woman shortly after 15:00 GMT on Friday.On Friday, a 67-year-old man was pulled from the water and died at the scene before a second body was recovered in the evening, Humberside Police said.HM Coastguard started the second day of searching for the missing person at first light but said the search been stood down at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon and would not be resumed.  HM Coastguard initially responded to reports of a \"number of people in difficulty in the water\" at the seaside town.Police did not provide the gender or age of the second body they recovered, and said the circumstances were not suspicious. Kevin Shoesmith/BBCGeorge Gouldson says he saw three people in the water George Gouldson, 73, was taking photographs of the stormy seas from his car when the incident began.He said he saw people \"running towards the towers\", a local landmark on the promenade.\"I saw three people in the water before others got in. One of the people in the water was a female.\"A bloke was trying to throw a life ring to her, but it wouldn't reach her. The tide just took her. She was swept away, along the length of the beach, towards the rocks. The water was that fierce. \"A load of people were trying to get to her. One bloke got out of the water. I picked him up and sat him against a wall. He looked to be hypothermic.\" BBC/Jessica LaneConditions at the scene have been described as \"horrendous\" as snow and ice warnings apply across much of the UKMr Gouldson, who returned to the scene with his dog on Saturday morning, said he did not see the woman or the two other people emerge from the water.\"It's something you see on television, not in Withernsea,\" he added.\"My mind just won't settle. It's just so sad.\"Janice Holgate, 60, drove 17 miles (27km) from her home in Hull to lay flowers at the scene.She said: \"It breaks my heart what has happened. It's an awful start to the year. I just wanted to do something.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJanice Holgate lays flowers close to the scene of the tragedyWithernsea Methodist Church opened its doors for prayers on Saturday morning.The Reverend Ian Greenfield said he had received messages from all over the country offering support.\"When we realized the severity of it and the tragedy of it, we felt it was really important that we had our church open this morning for people to come along.\"For people to be able to come and pray and to receive emotional support,\" he said.BBC/Jessica LaneMembers of the coastguard resumed searches at first light on SaturdayThe incident was first reported at 15:10 on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.  The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday and resumed at first light.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said teams from Hull, Withernsea, Hornsea and Bridlington were sent to the scene at 06:30 to continue the search.At Withernsea, snow began to fall just after first light and those searching have been battling bitterly cold and windy conditions along with driving snow.Snow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond and a yellow warning is in place for the east coast of England until 23:49 on Saturday.BBC/Amanda WhiteReverend Ian Greenfield says the community has received messages of support from across the UKA police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"Hornsea Inshore Rescue said on Friday it had faced \"horrendous conditions\" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.The operation has involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom McArthurBBCThe UK was not involved \"in any way\" in the US-led strikes on Venezuela, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said.Sir Keir said he had not yet spoken to US President Donald Trump about the US operation to seize President Nicolas Maduro in the country's capital, Caracas.Asked if he condemned the US action, as a number of other UK politicians have, he told reporters he wanted to \"establish facts\" and speak to Trump first about the \"fast moving situation\".The prime minister also said he was working with the UK embassy in Venezuela to ensure around 500 British citizens in the South American country are \"well looked-after, safeguarded and get appropriate advice\".Starmer said: \"I always say and believe we should uphold international law. \"But I think at this stage [in a] fast moving situation, let's establish the facts and take it from there.\"I want to establish the facts first. I want to speak to President Trump. \"I want to speak to allies. As I say I can be absolutely clear we were not involved in that.\"Trump said Venezuela's left-wing president and his wife were flown out of the country in a military operation in conjunction with US law enforcement.Elite Delta Force soldiers were used in the raid to capture them, according to the BBC's North American partner, CBS News.Maduro has been indicted on drugs and weapon charges, according to US officials. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he anticipates no further action against Venezuela.The strikes inside Venezuela come after sustained US pressure against the Maduro government.The US has accused the Venezuelan president of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader, while Maduro has accused the US of intimidation.Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said \"nobody will shed tears\" that Maduro had been \"removed\".She said: \"We have always strongly condemned Maduro's brutal and repressive regime and the Conservative government did not consider Maduro's administration as legitimate.\"We await the full facts about the US operation which has removed Maduro and we want to see the Venezuelan people enjoy democratic norms and freedoms.\"This is clearly a very serious geopolitical moment.\"Sir Ed Davey urged Starmer to condemn the US actions.The Liberal Democrat leader said: \"Keir Starmer should condemn Trump's illegal action in Venezuela. Maduro is a brutal and illegitimate dictator, but unlawful attacks like this make us all less safe.\"Trump is giving a green light to the likes of Putin and Xi to attack other countries with impunity.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the \"unorthodox\" military operation by the US could prove a deterrent to future Russian and Chinese aggression.Green Party leader Zack Polanski has called on the PM to condemn the US military strike, which he described as \"illegal\" and a \"breach of international human rights law\".The European Union's top diplomat said the situation in Venezuela was being closely monitored.Kaja Kallas said the EU had repeatedly stated that Maduro \"lacks legitimacy\" but defended a peaceful transition.She said that \"under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected\". \"We call for restraint,\" she said, adding that \"the safety of EU citizens in the country is our top priority\".",

    "body": "37 minutes agoTom McArthurGetty ImagesNetiv Haasara is a village just on the northern border of Gaza and was hit during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023The BBC has reached an agreement with an Israeli family who survived the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks, after a team of journalists entered their badly-damaged home without permission.A BBC News crew, including International Editor Jeremy Bowen, entered the home of an Israeli family on the Gaza border and filmed inside the property in the days after the deadly attacks.They filmed personal photographs of the family's children at a time when many of their friends and relatives still didn't know whether they had survived, the Jewish News reported. A BBC spokesperson said that while they did not generally comment on specific legal issues they were pleased to have reached an agreement in the case.Tzeela Horenstein said gunmen threw a grenade at her husband Simon during Hamas' attack on the village of Netiv HaAsara early in the morning of 7 October. The couple and their two young children only survived because their home's door twisted and jammed when the attackers tried to blow it out with explosives, she told the Jewish News, who first reported the story.She said: \"Not only did terrorists break into our home and try to murder us, but then the BBC crew entered again, this time with a camera as a weapon, without permission or consent.\"It was another intrusion into our lives. We felt that everything that was still under our control had been taken from us.\"The Jewish News reported that the corporation paid a financial settlement of £28,000 to the family. The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

The Met Office issued an amber weather warning for snow up until midday on Saturday, and numerous yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued for the coming days.The frigid conditions are set to persist by day and night into next week. Overnight snow showers may lead to disruption for the first proper commute of the year on Monday. Atlantic weather fronts clashing with the cold air may cause further issues as we head through the week too.",

    "body": "2 hours agoIone WellsSouth America correspondentGetty ImagesA man walks past a graffiti depicting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in CaracasThe US may want many of its foes gone from power. It doesn't usually send in the military and physically remove them.Venezuela's abrupt awakening took two forms.Its residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure.Its government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat.US President Donald Trump has announced its leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country. He now faces weapons and drugs charges. His exact whereabouts is unknown and his colleagues have demanded proof he is still alive.The US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega.Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality.The US has long accused Maduro too of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the 'Cartel de los Soles' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining.This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, marks a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region.The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power.Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections were widely dismissed by international observers as neither free nor fair.For Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed: that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.Follow live: US launches strikes on VenezuelaWatch: Reporter in Caracas describes hearing loud bangs and planesWhat we know about Maduro's captureWhy has Donald Trump attacked Venezuela?At least four locations have been targeted by strikes Venezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast.The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region.The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising of warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people.Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions.What remains deeply unclear is what comes next inside Venezuela itself.The US would clearly like the Venezuelan opposition, who it is allied with, to take power – potentially either led by opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, or the opposition candidate from the 2024 elections Edmundo Gonzalez.However, even some strong critics of Maduro warn this would not be simple given the government's grip on power in the country.It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as 'colectivos.'AFP via Getty ImagesFuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in CaracasSome fear US intervention could trigger violent fragmentation and a prolonged power struggle. Even some who dislike Maduro and want to see him gone are wary of US intervention being the means – remembering decades of US-backed coups and regime change in Latin America in the 20th century.The opposition itself is also divided in parts - not all back a transition to Machado or her support for Trump.It's not clear what the US's next move is.Will it try to push for fresh elections? Will it try to depose further senior members of the government or the military and force them to face justice in the US?As for Trump, his administration has become increasingly muscular in the region what with a financial bailout for Argentina, tariffs whacked on Brazil to try to influence the coup trial of Trump's ally and former right-wing Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, and now the military intervention in Venezuela. He benefits from having more allies in the region now - with the continent shifting Right in recent elections such as in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. But while Maduro has few allies in the region, there are still big powers like Brazil and Colombia who do not support US military intervention. And some of Trump's own MAGA base in the US are also not happy at his growing interventionism after promising to put 'America First.'For Maduro's closest allies, Saturday's events raise urgent questions and fears about their own futures.Many may not want to give up the fight or allow a transition unless they feel they could receive some kind of protection or reassurance from persecution themselves.",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.Meanwhile, an Iranian police spokesman said officers would not allow what he called \"enemies\" to turn \"unrest into chaos\".Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while and another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.But the country's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi-Azad warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with a \"decisive response\".This stance was echoed by Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said it was \"completely fair\" that shopkeepers protest the economic situation, but that any \"rioters must be put in their place\".Iran's UN Ambassador Amir-Saeid Iravani called on the UN Security Council to condemn Trump's statement in letter to the secretary-general and president of the Security Council on Friday, news agency Reuters reported. \"Iran will exercise its rights decisively and proportionately. The United States of America bears full responsibility for any consequences arising from these unlawful threats and any ensuing escalation,\" he wrote in the letter.",

    "body": "Image source, ReutersImage caption, An airplane passes near the total solar eclipse in Bloomington, Indiana, US in 2024ByShireen JordanBBC WeatherThe 2026 night sky is set to bring UK stargazers some wonderful celestial events to look out for.The highlight will be the solar eclipse with up to 90% of the Sun obscured.  Miss it and there won't be another one until September 2090. There is also a partial lunar eclipse, three supermoons, a blue Moon, a February planet alignment plus an array of meteor showers to enjoy.As activity on the surface of the Sun remains high, you can expect it to be another year of colourful sightings of the Northern Lights. First Meteor Shower of 2026Image source, NurPhoto via Getty imagesWe begin 2026 with the annual Quadrantid meteor shower which has been active since the end of December 2025. It will peak between 3 and 4 January with the best viewing conditions before dawn on 4 January. They are among the most active of meteor showers and have been known to produce over 100 meteors an hour on a clear night.The Quadrantids have a narrow peak of a few hours and this year are competing with a bright, full Moon. But there are an array of other meteor showers to look forward to in 2026 including:The Lyrids: April 22-23 The Eta Aquariids: May 6-7 The Perseids: August 12-13The Geminids: December 13-14For the best chances of seeing a meteor shower, move away from light pollution, wrap up warm and let your eyes adjust to the night sky for at least 15 minutes. No equipment is needed - though a clear sky and a lot of patience are helpful.Three supermoons and a blue MoonImage source, ReutersImage caption, A passenger plane passes in front of October 2025's Harvest MoonThere will be three supermoons in 2026 starting with the first Moon of the new year on 3 January, known as the Wolf Moon. This will be the fourth supermoon in a row, following on from three we had at the end of 2025. The two other supermoons in 2026 are the Beaver Moon on 24 November followed by the Cold Moon on 23 December.Supermoons happen when the Moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit, appearing up to 15% brighter and 30% bigger than regular full Moons.Additionally there will be an extra full Moon on 31 May, known as a blue Moon - the name given to the second full Moon in a calendar month. We usually get 12 full Moons a year, but as this doesn't quite match up with the lunar cycle roughly every two and half years we get an additional full Moon. As it only happens once every few years, it is where we get the expression 'once in a blue Moon' from.If you want to take a picture make sure you turn off the flash on your phone, activate night mode and use ambient light. Oh, and check the BBC Weather forecast.Image source, EPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockDeep partial solar eclipseThe UK will see a significant partial solar eclipse on 12 August, when the Moon covers a large part of the Sun's rays as it passes between the Earth and Sun.Up to 90% of the Sun will be eclipsed, depending on where you are in the UK.It will begin at 18:17 BST, with the maximum happening at 19:13.Across parts of Europe a total solar eclipse will be visible - where the Moon completely covers the Sun. For example in Iceland, parts of Greenland and northern Spain, as well as the Arctic. This astronomical phenomenon requires the Sun, Moon and Earth to be in complete alignment.The next full solar eclipse in the UK will not happen for another 64 years, on 23 September 2090, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, external.You should never look directly at the Sun and experts recommend observing a partial solar eclipse safely with special solar filter glasses.Partial lunar eclipseImage source, PA MediaImage caption, A partial lunar eclipse is visible above Surrey Quays, London, UK, in March 2025August 2026 will also see a partial lunar eclipse visible from the UK. This happens when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon and part of its shadow covers the Moon. It takes place on 28 August where around 90% of the Moon will be darkened by the Earth's shadow.Lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye as they only reflect sunlight. Top tips are to minimise light in your vicinity and watch from a spot where your view is not obstructed by tall buildings or trees.  Check the BBC Weather forecast beforehand online or on your app  and hope for a cloud-free sky.Planets line upOn 28 February in the northern hemisphere, six planets will be in alignment and visible in the night sky. Four can be seen by the naked eye: Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and Mercury. To see Uranus and Neptune you'll need a pair of binoculars or a small telescope.The Moon which will be almost at peak brightness, will also be in the sky, appearing very close to Jupiter making for striking viewing.Image source, BBC Weather Watchers / BeachMadJenImage caption, Crescent Moon and Venus lighting up the night sky in February 2025Another good year for the Northern LightsThe Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, graced our skies multiple times in 2025, as the Sun's 11-year cycle of activity peaked.Solar activity is expected to remain elevated for the first part of 2026, before the Sun enters its declining phase which leads back to the next solar minimum around 2030.Aurora displays are caused by charged particles from the Sun colliding with gases in the Earth's atmosphere around the magnetic poles. The most vivid auroras occur when the Sun emits large clouds of particles called Coronal Mass Ejections (CME's).Aurora appear as bright, swirling beacons of light that range in colour from red to purple and green to blue.

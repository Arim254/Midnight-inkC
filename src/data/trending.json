    "body": "3 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondent andKathryn ArmstrongFar-right activist Tommy Robinson was unlawfully stopped driving a Bentley at the entrance to the Channel Tunnel, and counter-terrorism officers made a disproportionate use of their powers, his lawyer has told a court.The 42-year-old, who was charged under his real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon is standing trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court for refusing to give the Pin for his mobile phone to officers during the stop. He has pleaded not guilty.Prosecutor Jo Morris said that while the stop may not have been \"perfect\", that does not mean it was unlawful. Judgement in the trial has been delayed until 4 November following closing arguments.If found guilty, Mr Lennon could be jailed for up to three months and/or receive a £2,500 fine.He was stopped by police on 28 July, 2024, using their counter-terrorism powers as he prepared to enter the Channel Tunnel while driving a silver Bentley Bentayga.Officers from Kent Police said they did so partly because he was driving someone else's car and had not pre-booked his ticket. They said they became more suspicious when Mr Lennon would not make eye contact with them and said he was driving all the way to Benidorm. When asked for the Pin to his phone he refused.A person who is detained under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act is legally obliged to provide the password or Pin for electronic devices.In his closing submissions to the judge on Tuesday, Mr Lennon's barrister, Alisdair Williamson KC, said: \"The question for you. Is this a lawful stop? If it is not, you cannot convict Mr Lennon.\"Mr Williamson described the power that police officers have at ports and airport as \"extraordinary\" and said there needed to be \"assiduous oversight\" of this power, which he described as the only one there was to \"compel people under pain of criminal penalty to answer questions\". He described Mr Lennon as a \"public figure\" whose views are \"well known\" and asked what the justification was for the police's use of \"coercive powers\". \"What were they going to find out that wasn't in the public domain?\" Mr Williamson asked. He pointed out that the officers did not ask any further questions about the Bentley after Mr Lennon told them it belonged to \"a mate\" and said his client travelled to Benidorm regularly. In her closing speech, prosecutor Jo Morris said \"we accept that the stop may not have been a perfect one but that does not make it unlawful\". She said \"there was no real dispute over the facts\" and that Mr Lennon had been warned of the consequences and was offered legal advice but still refused to give officers his Pin. Before the hearing began on Monday, Mr Lennon - the former leader of the English Defence League (EDL) - said on X that the social media platform's billionaire owner, Elon Musk - who has previously championed him - had \"picked up the legal bill\" for the case against him, which Mr Lennon described as \"state persecution\". Mr Musk has not publicly confirmed this.",

Whether this means custody or not will be decided when all the information is before the court.\" The court heard Coote extracted the video from a hard drive to a laptop on 2 January 2020.Getty ImagesCoote officiated his first match in the Premier League in 2018He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge at a hearing on 10 September at Nottingham Magistrates' Court.At the six-minute hearing on Tuesday, Coote, who wore a navy suit and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name and enter his guilty plea.The charge of making an indecent image of a child refers to activities such as downloading, sharing or saving photos or videos containing abuse.Judge Shant KC said: \"You must not go away with the impression that this will not lead to a custodial sentence.\"Coote was sacked last year when comments made in a video about former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp in 2020 came to light.In August this year, he was given an eight-week suspension by the Football Association over the Klopp footage.In addition, the ex-official is also banned by European football's governing body Uefa until 30 June 2026 after photographs emerged of him snorting a white powder through a bank note while in Germany for Euro 2024.In January, Coote came out as gay in an interview with The Sun and said a lifelong struggle to hide his sexuality had contributed to the rant about Klopp.Additional reporting by PA Media",

    "body": "Asylum seeker laughed after killing woman, jury told3 hours agoJames Bovillat Wolverhampton Crown Court andPhil MackieMidlands CorrespondentFamily / British Transport PoliceRhiannon Whyte's blood was found on Deng Majek's clothes, the court heardAn asylum seeker from Sudan danced and laughed after murdering a Walsall hotel worker in a \"vicious and frenzied attack\" on a train station platform, a trial has heard. Prosecutors allege Deng Majek, who claims to be 19, stabbed 27-year-old Rhiannon Whyte 23 times with a screwdriver at Bescot Stadium railway station on 20 October 2024. She died in hospital three days later.Opening the case for the prosecution at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Michelle Heeley KC told the jury that the defendant was \"clearly excited about what he had done\".Mr Majek denies murder. Ms Heeley told the court Ms Wyte's blood was found on the defendant's clothes, while her DNA was discovered under his fingernails.She said Mr Majek was seen on CCTV at the Park Inn Hotel in Walsall, laughing shortly after killing her. The defendant had been living at the hotel, which houses asylum seekers, while Ms Whyte had worked there for about three months.The court heard her job included cleaning and serving food and co-workers could not recall any issue which might have led to the attack.\"There had been an issue about some broken biscuits with some of the residents but nothing serious,\" Ms Heeley said.In a statement released following her death, Rhiannon Whyte's family described her as \"selfless... brave, quirky, funny\" and always there for other people. Police were at the station following the incident The prosecution said CCTV showed the defendant staring at Ms Whyte, before he followed her from the hotel to the railway station when she finished her shift at 23:00 BST. \"He had been hanging around waiting for her to leave and waited until she was on her own before he followed her,\" Ms Heeley said.The court was told Ms Whyte called a friend at 23:04 and he was seen on CCTV cameras closing the gap on her as she approached the deserted platform.Ms Heeley said: \"It was then that the prosecution say that this defendant attacked her.\"Her friend heard a scream and then another scream, before the phone went dead at 23:19.The prosecution said Mr Majek could then be seen running back up the stairs with an object in his hand, which they said was Ms Whyte's mobile phone.Ms Heeley said he then went to a local shop to buy himself a drink before returning to the hotel.Slumped on platformShe added: \"In between the station and the hotel he had thrown Rhiannon's phone into a river. \"Once at the hotel he was seen dancing and laughing, clearly excited about what he had done.\"The train she had been due to catch pulled in at 23:24 and the driver saw a figure slumped on the platform, the court was told.Ms Heeley said the guard tried to help her, along with another employee from the hotel, but nothing could be done to save her and she died on 23 October, having never regained consciousness.The court was told 11 of the 23 stab wounds penetrated her skull, one of which damaged the brain stem, causing her death. She also had injuries to her chest and arm, indicating she had tried to defend herself, the court heard. The puncture wounds had the appearance of a cross-headed screwdriver, which has never been found. Ms Heeley said: \"He left her bleeding to death and then casually went back to his hotel. We say you can be sure he is guilty of murder.\"The trial is expected to last about three weeks.  Related internet links",

    "body": "53 minutes agoLaura Gozzi andPaul KirbyEurope digital editorBloomberg via Getty ImagesSébastien Lecornu announced the planned suspension two days before his new government faced votes of confidenceFrench Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has told parliament he backs suspending controversial 2023 pension reforms, in the face of crucial votes of no-confidence later this week.The changes, which raised the retirement age from 62 to 64, were seen as signature reforms in Emmanuel Macron's presidency.\"This autumn I will propose to parliament that we suspend the 2023 pension reform until the [2027] presidential election,\" Lecornu said to applause from left-wing parties.Lecornu was reappointed prime minister last week only four days after he resigned, and needs the support of Socialist MPs in parliament if his government is to survive.Opposition parties on the far right and far left have called confidence votes, known as \"censure\" votes on Lecornu's government, for Thursday morning and are demanding parliamentary elections.The Socialists said they would be prepared to support the new government, but only if it promises a complete suspension of Macron's pension changes.\"If he does not explicitly say the words 'immediate and complete suspension of the pension reform', it will be censure,\" Socialist MP Laurent Baumel said earlier on French TV.\"He is holding his destiny in his own hands. He knows what he has do if he doesn't want to be the prime minister who resigns every week.\"The reforms were finally pushed through parliament in March 2023, less than a year after Macron was voted in for a second presidential term.There had been months of political debate, strikes and street protests, and in the end the bill had to go through without a vote in parliament using a constitutional mechanism known as 49:3. Last week, Lecornu said it was something many French people remembered as a \"wound on democracy\" .On Tuesday he made it plain to MPs that suspending the pension reform would cost €400m (£350m) in 2026 and a further €1.8bn (£1.57bn) in 2027. This will have to be \"compensated by other savings,\" Lecornu said.Lecornu is France's third prime minister in the past year but even if he does survive he needs to get a budget through parliament that brings down a budget deficit heading for 5.4% of economic output (GDP) this year. France's public debt earlier this year stood at €3.4tn, or almost 114% of GDP, the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.Lecornu has been one of Macron's most loyal allies, so his decision to row back on such a contested reform shows how keen the president is to avoid further turmoil.Philippe Aghion, who was jointly awarded the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday, said earlier that he also backed a suspension of the pension reform, because it would still come at a smaller cost than the instability that would follow another government collapse.\"We're living through an era of crisis,\" Lecornu told MPs. \"Some people want the situation to turn into a regime crisis, but that won't happen.\"Promising a \"serious and reliable budget\", the prime minister also vowed to bring an end to reliance on the 49:3 mechanism to push through legal changes without a vote. Since late 2022, every budget has had to be forced through without a vote.Repeatedly, he told the chamber that \"the government will propose, we will debate and you will vote\".Parliament will have \"the final word\", he said.To audible groans from MPs, Lecornu proposed a working group to look into pensions, and said it would have to come to a decision by the time of the next presidential election.France's budget deficit is far above the EU target of 3% of GDP, and Lecornu said that reversing the pension reform would have to be \"financially compensated, including through cost-saving measures. It cannot be carried out at the expense of an increased deficit\".Marine Le Pen's hard-right National Rally and the radical-left France Unbowed (LFI) of Jean-Luc Mélenchon have both tabled confidence votes in Lecornu's government on Thursday, but would need the support of centre-left parties to bring him down.Le Pen and Mélenchon believe elections are the only way of ending the political deadlock that came out of snap elections called by Macron in the summer of 2024.That deadlock turned to turmoil last week when Lecornu resigned as prime minister 26 days after Macron had appointed him, and only hours after he had named his government.In a week of political twists and drama, Macron then reappointed him late on Friday.The move was widely seen as a last-ditch attempt by the president to exercise control over an increasingly rudderless National Assembly, which has been splintered into three distinct factions since the 2024 vote.That hung parliament has resulted in two short-lived prime ministers who were voted down within months when they attempted to put forward their yearly budgets.Eight days ago, Lecornu stood down before he could even face MPs.",

    "body": "5 hours agoJames MelleySenior Social Affairs ProducerFamily photoMaria Morris's family says they still have questions about what led to her deathA mental health trust says it is planning to install CCTV following the death of a patient in mysterious circumstances.Maria Morris, 44, was found unresponsive at Bethlem Hospital in south London on 21 September 2021 with four socks down her throat, and a large unexplained bruise on her back.She died hours later in hospital from a brain injury caused by a lack of oxygen. A consultant who treated her questioned whether she had been assaulted.An inquest jury at South London Coroners' court concluded that her death was accidental, but her family says they still have questions about what led to her death.Large bruise on her backThe inquest heard that Maria Morris, who worked as a teaching assistant, had bi-polar affective disorder.In September 2021, her family and friends became concerned when she started acting erratically and found that she had stopped taking her medication.Police were called after she ran away from a friend while walking in a park. When found, she was delusional and taken to Croydon Hospital.She was transferred to Bethlem Royal Hospital, a mental health hospital run by South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM), on 18 September where she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.The jury was told that while Maria was on the unit, she raised a number of concerns about how staff were treating patients. She told one member of staff that patients were being \"punished\" at night.On the evening of the 21 September, Maria was observed by staff in her room at 20:00 and then again at 20:30. At 21:23, a member of staff found her unconscious on the floor of her room, having had a cardiac arrest.During attempts to resuscitate her, a sock was found in her throat. When paramedics arrived, three further socks were removed from her throat.By the time she was transferred to Croydon University Hospital, she had suffered a hypoxic brain injury. A few hours later she went into cardiac arrest again and died on 22 September.The jury was told that Dr Simon Wood, an intensive care doctor at Croydon Hospital who treated Maria, alerted the police to a large bruise on her back.He also said that, in his view, a patient wouldn't have been able to push socks down their own throat without gagging. He was concerned that this may have indicated she'd been assaulted.The jury heard that there was no CCTV used on the wards at Bethlem Hospital and there was nothing in Maria's notes or observations to explain the bruising.Maria's room was locked when she was found. The court heard that most patients had keys for their own rooms, but there was no record on who had what key.Staff had master keys that could unlock all the patients' rooms.Untested bloodIn a statement read to the court, Metropolitan police officer DC Herdeep Jugdev said that his investigation had been hindered because Maria's room in Bethlem had been cleared, and the sock disposed of, before they got there 19 hours after her death was reported.During their investigation, the police spotted what appeared to be blood under Maria's nails, although this did not appear to have been tested to see whose it was.John Taylor, the South London Coroner, told the jury that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Maria was assaulted on the ward, or that someone else had pushed socks into her airway.The inquest heard conflicting evidence from staff at Bethlem about how often Maria was checked on the night she died.Some documents and witnesses suggested she should have been checked four or five times an hour. Others suggested she should have been checked once an hour.The jury concluded that Maria had pushed the socks down her own throat, but that her death had been accidental. They were unable to reach a conclusion on whether a lack of observations contributed to her death, because of the conflicting evidence.'Immense pain'In a statement, Maria's family said she was a much-loved mother, daughter and sister, and that her death \"has left a profound and lasting void in the hearts of her family and all who loved her\".\"We are grateful to the jury for having identified that there were missed opportunities around communication, documentation and observations. \"As a family, the idea that more could have been done to keep her safe causes us immense pain.\"The family also said it felt the jury was not allowed to comment on all the issues it considered to be important.\"As a family we still have questions about exactly what happened that night.\"South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLAM) says it will be rolling out CCTV in all its wards and opening a new CCTV control centre in November.",

    "body": "2 hours agoAlice CuddySenior international reporter, in Tel AvivBBCRotem Cooper says his father's body not being returned was a \"disappointment\"The son of an Israeli hostage whose body remains in Gaza has told the BBC he is dealing with the realisation that \"it's not over and it's going to be a longer battle\".Rotem Cooper, whose father Amiram is among 24 hostages whose bodies were not returned to Israel on Monday, said the families were trying \"to find the strength somehow to pick ourselves up... and continue the fight\".He called on US President Donald Trump, Qatar, Egypt and other countries involved in peace deal negotiations \"to show Hamas that this is not acceptable\".A ceasefire and hostage release agreement signed by Israel and Hamas stated that the remaining hostages in Gaza would be returned by noon on Monday, with nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel released in exchange.While the 20 hostages still alive were released, a copy of the agreement published by Israeli media appeared to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not be able to locate all of the bodies of the deceased hostages by the deadline.Follow updates on this storyTheir families had pinned their hopes on their loved one returning on Monday, after two years in captivity.\"We hoped and expected that maybe 15 to 20 out of the 28 deceased hostages would be released, but that didn't happen. Only four were announced,\" Mr Cooper said.Family handoutAmiram Cooper was kidnapped from his home alongside his wife on 7 October 2023He described the news as a \"very big disappointment\" for the families.\"It's clear to us that they could have and should have released more and [that] they're playing games.\"Mr Cooper's parents were both kidnapped in the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on Israel, from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His mother was released later that month while his father was killed in captivity.Who are the released hostages?What happens next in Gaza ceasefire plan after hostage release?The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had been operating in the area at the time but did not confirm how he was killed, referring the BBC this week to a previous statement saying the circumstances were \"under examination\". Hamas has claimed he was killed by an Israeli military strike.AFP via Getty ImagesDozens of people were at Re'im military base to see the return of the hostages on MondayThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the relatives of many of the hostages, has called for \"a very serious response\" from the Israeli government and mediators, for what is described as Hamas's \"violation of the agreement\". It said further stages of the peace plan should not progress until all the remaining bodies had been returned.Mr Cooper headed to the Re'im military base in southern Israel on Monday to see the return of the 20 living hostages.In voicenotes sent over the course of the day, he described feeling \"tremendous anticipation\" and a \"big relief\" as he saw them return. But he said the thought of the bodies coming back to Israel was \"heartbreaking\".Family handoutRuby Chen (R) with his son Itay (L), whose body still remains in GazaSpeaking again the following day, after the news that the four bodies returned did not include Amiram's, he described the experience as a \"big rollercoaster\".Mr Cooper said the return of his father's body would allow him to have \"some closure\" and to \"sleep better at night\".\"Everything has been on hold,\" he said.Ruby Chen, whose son Itay's body remains in Gaza, said he had experienced a similar mix of emotions.\"We were overjoyed [on Monday] to see 20 hostages coming out and being reunited with their families, but we were very disappointed not to see more deceased hostages coming out,\" he said in a video message shared with the BBC by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\"We request the Israeli government, the US and the mediators to continue the fight and put pressure on Hamas to adhere [to] and follow the agreement that was signed and bring back all the remaining 24 hostages in captivity,\" Mr Chen added.The Israeli military said on Tuesday that, following forensic tests, it had identified the four hostages whose bodies had been returned and had informed their families that their loved ones had been reburied. It said they included Guy Iloz - who was shot at the Nova music festival and is believed to have died from the wounds - and Bipin Joshi, who it said was believed to have been \"murdered in captivity during the first months of the war\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoLewis AdamsEssexPA MediaFayaz Khan made the threat in a video he uploaded to TikTokA man who came to the UK on a small boat and threatened to kill Nigel Farage has been jailed for five years.Fayaz Khan, 26, made a gun gesture with his hand, pointed to an AK-47 tattoo on his face and named the Reform UK leader in a TikTok post in October 2024.Authorities believed the Afghan migrant had given them a false name and he was actually a 31-year-old called Fayaz Husseini, Southwark Crown Court heard.Speaking outside court, Farage said it was a \"win\" that \"violent criminal\" Khan had been jailed.The defendant was found guilty on Friday of making threats to kill the MP for Clacton, in Essex. In the video on his \"madapasa\" account on TikTok, Khan pointed towards his face tattoo and said he was going to \"pop, pop, pop\" Farage, referring to him as \"Englishman Nigel\".PA MediaFarage told the gathered media outside court that Khan was a \"violent criminal\"Farage described the threat as \"pretty chilling\" during the trial, adding: \"Given his proximity to guns and love of guns, I was genuinely worried.\"\"The only reason we know about this guy is because somebody sent it to me on TikTok,\" he added after the sentencing.\"It makes me wonder how many other madapasas are there now in this country?\"It followed Khan shouting from the dock that he wanted to go back to Afghanistan, accusing Farage of using him \"because you want to be prime minister\".A Home Office spokesman said: \"The man has himself said he wants to leave this country – and we will do everything in our power to ensure he does.\"Khan was one of 65 migrants on board a black inflatable boat that entered the UK by crossing the English Channel.\"The defendant livestreamed the recording of his crossing, which appears to have gathered a large online viewing,\" said prosecutor Peter Ratliff.'Enemies' The court heard Khan gave a false name because he had \"enemies he did not want to find him\".However, the prosecution said it was \"more likely\" he had given misleading details due to his criminal record while living in Sweden.Mr Ratliff also disputed Khan's claim that he was unaware it was illegal to arrive in the UK by small boat.He claimed Khan \"intended to encourage others\" by documenting his journey from Sweden to the UK, sharing it with hundreds of thousands of viewers online.Metropolitan PoliceKhan spent nine years living in Sweden before he came to the UK in October 2024The court was told Khan had 17 previous convictions in Sweden, including for carrying a knife, threatening behaviour and vandalism.Khan was also jailed in June 2019 after using threatening behaviour towards a public servant.On 12 October 2024, Farage uploaded a video to YouTube entitled \"the journey of an illegal migrant\", which showed Khan and referenced \"young males of fighting age coming into our country about whom we know very little\".'Gun gestures'Jurors in Khan's trial were told he responded with a TikTok video two days later, threatening Farage.In the video, he said: \"You not know me. I come to England because I want to marry with your sister. You not know me.\"Don't talk about me more. Delete the video.\"I'm coming to England. I'm going to pop, pop, pop.\"Mr Ratliff told the jury that while Khan said \"pop, pop, pop\", he made \"gun gestures\" with his hand and headbutted the camera.During sentencing, Khan's barrister said the defendant wanted to apologise to Farage and his sister \"for any offence and upset caused\".He was also sentenced to eight months - to run concurrently - for entering the UK illegally, having previously pleaded guilty to the offence.Nicholas Coates, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Khan not only entered the UK illegally – but made sinister threats against a Member of Parliament in plain view of thousands of followers.\"Elected politicians must be able to carry out their jobs free from the fear of harm or abuse, and we will make sure that those who seek to intimidate them face the full force of the law.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

It was advertised as \"inclusive\", but it was only open to men, boys, and girls under 12.MP Steve Reed said blocking women was \"absolutely unacceptable\" and that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) would investigate.The ELM has not directly addressed the criticism but said it had a \"long-standing commitment to supporting women and girls\" and encourages women to take part in various sporting activities.The annual event is described on the mosque's website as having become a \"highlight in the East London Muslim calendar\", raising thousands of pounds for causes across the UK and abroad, including local youth projects, food banks and refugee support.When asked about women being barred from the race on LBC Radio, Reed said: \"I saw these reports... and I was as horrified as anybody else.\"It's absolutely unacceptable that women should be blocked from going on a fun run in a public space when the men are allowed to go out there and do that.'We cannot tolerate that'He said he was sure the equalities watchdog would be aware of the case and appropriate sanctions would follow.He added: \"Speaking for myself, I was appalled.\"We do not want a situation in this country where men are allowed to do things that women are then barred from. We cannot tolerate that.\"The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, is quoted on the website congratulating all those who took part, \"especially to the youngsters and the elders and the community at large for participating today\".The council said it had contacted the mosque to \"seek urgent clarification\" after reports about age and gender restrictions.ReutersSteve Reed said it was \"absolutely unacceptable\" for women to be barred from the event An EHRC spokesperson said each complaint was considered carefully and that there are certain exceptions under equality law that can apply to charities and belief organisations, including potentially restricting events to one sex only.A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: \"This was an independent event held in Victoria Park, not organised by the council.\"Like many local charitable events, it made use of the park space. We are firmly committed to ensuring leisure and sporting activities in Tower Hamlets are inclusive and accessible.\"Last weekend's event was the mosque's 12th annual charity run.A spokesperson for the mosque said: \"ELM encourages women to take part in sporting activities. There are many Muslim women from our community who have taken part in sporting events including boat races, cycling, hiking and marathons as well as various sporting challenges to raise funds for charity.\"We remain committed to listening to the needs of our community and ensuring our programmes serve everyone.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "2 hours agoFaisal IslamBBC Economics EditorGetty ImagesChancellor Rachel Reeves said, despite the IMF's upgrade to UK economic growth, \"for too many people, our economy feels stuck\"The UK is set to be the second-fastest-growing of the world's most advanced economies this year, according to new projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).But the IMF also predicts the UK will face the highest rate of inflation in the G7 both this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills.Prices are forecast to rise by 3.4% this year and 2.5% in 2026, but the IMF says higher inflation is likely to be temporary, and should fall to 2% by the end of next year.UK economic growth rates remain modest at 1.3% for this year and next, but that outperforms the other G7 economies apart from the US in 2025, in a torrid year of trade and geopolitical tensions.The G7 are seven advanced economies - the US, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan - but the group does not include fast-growing economies such as China and India.The IMF is an international organisation with 190 member countries. They work together to maintain global economic stability.In the IMF's forecast for economic growth, it predicts the UK will push Canada out of second place, after its trade-war-affected economy was hit by the biggest downgrades for 2025 and 2026. However, Canada is expected to retake second place next year when its economy is forecast to grow at a rate of 1.5%.Germany, France and Italy are all forecast to grow far more slowly at rates of between 0.2 and 0.9% in 2025 and 2026.Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the fresh upgrade to the IMF's outlook for the UK's economy.\"But know this is just the start. For too many people, our economy feels stuck,\" she said.\"Working people feel it every day, experts talk about it, and I am going to deal with it.\"But highlighting the inflation forecasts, shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said the IMF assessment made for \"grim reading\".He said that UK households were \"being squeezed from all sides\", adding: \"Since taking office, Labour have allowed the cost of living to rise, debt to balloon and business confidence to collapse to record lows.\"The IMF said a slight overall upgrade for the UK in its World Economic Outlook, from its previous outlook in April, was due to \"strong activity in the first half of 2025\" and an improved trade outlook, partly thanks to the recently announced US-UK trade deal.Trump tariffs loom largeThe global outlook is dominated by the so far \"muted response\" of the world economy to the imposition of hefty tariffs on almost all imports into the US, a weakened dollar, questions about the independence of the US Federal Reserve and sky-high valuations of US tech companies.The IMF expects some of this to unwind soon, saying \"resilience is giving way to warning signs\". In the US tariff costs which had been absorbed by exporters and retailers, are now feeding into higher goods prices. So far tariffs have been reflected in higher prices for American shoppers of household appliances, but not of food and clothing.In an interview with the BBC, the IMF's chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the worst consequences of a global trade war had been tempered.\"Bottom line: the effect of the tariff shock is there. It is negative for global outlook. It is weighing down on investment and consumption decisions, there is trade policy uncertainty… but it's not as bad as expected because the shock itself has been scaled down and there are these offsets\".The IMF cited Brexit as an example of how uncertainty around major changes in trading arrangements can, after a delay, lead to steady falls in investment.Economist tells the BBC's Michelle Fleury he sees \"lower growth\" and \"higher inflation\" for USAI warningThe IMF also pointed to a possible bursting of the US AI tech boom.\"Excessively optimistic growth expectations about AI could be revised in light of incoming data from early adopters and could trigger a market correction,\" the IMF said.The IMF's separate Global Financial Stability Report added to concerns about tech stock market valuations, concluding that \"markets appear complacent\".Mr Gourinchas said the IMF was not asserting that there would be an imminent bursting of a bubble.\"Whether this will be followed by a market correction, I don't think anyone can tell for sure, but we have to be looking out for potential risk, and certainly this is one of the risks,\" he said.The concentration of the overvaluation of tech stocks on a small number of companies was now \"substantially higher\" than at the dotcom bubble in 2020, the IMF said.However, Mr Gourinchas said the \"AI investment boom\" was also helping sustain US economic growth. The forecasts were released on the eve of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank attended by the world's finance ministers and central bankers in Washington DC, with considerable attention on a new US bailout for Argentina.Correction 14 October: An earlier version of this article said the UK would have the second-fastest growing economy of the G7 both this year and next.

You were my first boyfriend... You were a literal ray of light in my life back then.\"Dan & Phil take on Taylor Swift in an art challenge at the Radio 1 Teen Awards in 2013Dan continued: \"And what we had was the most important thing to me and I wanted to protect it, so when other people tried to grab it and drag it into the light, I felt completely violated.\"Having all of these people trying to out us, and being so hostile to me when I tried to hide it, was so triggering. Honestly, it could have killed me.\"Dan added that he felt like someone had put a curse on them, with them achieving huge success \"but half the time it's going to suck for years, wake up in the night with anxiety, you're going to have panic attacks\".He said there were times when he thought he might be \"happier without all of this\". \"Yeah, [in] 2017 I'm thinking, my solo comedy content is killing it on YouTube, this could just be my life. I could be like every other YouTube boy and just enjoy this without the apocalyptic, constant stress of this Dan and Phil dating conspiracy.\"'A cycle of never-ending closets'He said he had decided to make the relationship public after a recent therapy session.\"My therapist said, 'Dan, you love being in the closet'. And I was like, 'Excuse me?'\"He continued: \"I spent so long not being authentic and being trapped in a situation, that I am comfortable being miserable in an environment where I don't do the thing that would suddenly make me feel better. I am in a cycle of never-ending closets, and this secret conspiracy is just another thing that I'm trapped inside.\"Phil added that some followers may have already guessed, but making the announcement was \"a big scary deal for us, it's kind of like another mini coming out\".He acknowledged that the move may attract more homophobia.\"Look, sure, this is a scary time in the world,\" Dan replied. \"Let's be real, it feels like things are sliding backwards because the fighting for what was important was going a bit too well.\"But I think that's why it's more important than ever that we're like, 'You know what? Hey, here we are, gay. And what?'\"'Happy and relieved'Their reveal was met with praise and love from longtime fans.\"I just adore you both so much,\" wrote one.Another wrote: \"Listen. Not our business. Never been our business. Fully aware it's parasocial. But after all these years, I'm both very, very happy for you both and feeling a bizarre sense of relief.\"\"Thank you for making me feel accepted just as I am throughout the years. I am glad you both feel safe enough to be your authentic selves!\" posted someone.\"This is like gay independence day,\" said another.Followers also celebrated what a big part of their lives the pair have been over the years.\"I've finished my bachelor's, master's, med school, and a PhD by the time they hard-launched their relationship,\" wrote one.\"Big day for girls who were on Tumblr from 2012-2015,\" said someone else.\"There's at least 20 people I haven't spoken to in seven years that I need to call RIGHT NOW,\" wrote another.\"I've literally had to go outside and have a cigarette,\" someone else posted.",

    "body": "14 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsTina JefferyTina was in a coma for six weeks after falling down a flight of stairsAs Tina walks onto the stage in front of hundreds of people she is beaming. She's collecting her British Sign Language (BSL) certificate which is the culmination of a journey that began with tragedy.\"Learning BSL has helped me say words that I cannot speak,\" she says.In 2018, while returning from a holiday, Tina fell down a flight of stairs and was in a coma for six weeks. The accident caused a traumatic brain injury that dramatically changed her life, leaving her struggling to speak. Before the fall, Tina had been a high achiever - she and her husband Mark met while working as navigators in the RAF, and Tina went on to retrain as a lawyer. Now 59, Tina says learning sign language has given her a new way to communicate. \"I'm scared of talking sometimes but BSL has helped me relax as sometimes I remember the sign if I can't remember a word.\"Three years ago, Tina and Mark moved to Hughenden Gardens Retirement Village in High Wycombe to access more support. \"When I arrived here I only spoke a bit and I was very silent as I wasn't very confident,\" explains Tina.But as a result of moving to the village, they became participants in the BBC series Rose Ayling-Ellis: Old Hands, New Tricks, filmed in March, which set out to explore how British Sign Language could transform the lives of older residents. Rogan ProductionsParticipants of Rose's documentary say the process of learning BSL was rewarding despite being challenging at times The series sees Rose, who has been deaf since birth, teach BSL to a group of older residents, showing how it uses visual sign language using gestures, facial expressions and body language to communicate.\"People think sign language is just for deaf people but it's so much more than that, especially for people who are losing their hearing,\" Ayling-Ellis explains. \"BSL has helped Tina communicate as you use your face and expressions as well as hands so you can understand emotions better,\" Mark, 64, says. She is one of five residents to achieve a Level 1 BSL qualification, alongside several staff members.\"I'm so proud of them,\" Ayling-Ellis says. \"I didn't think they could get further than the alphabet but they proved me wrong and should be proud of themselves.\" Tina has continued to learn BSL after the documentary through classes taught by her husband. Despite never intending to teach, after taking part in the TV series, Mark now leads regular practice sessions with 20 people. \"We raised some money to get a proper instructor to give us lessons but alongside the formal lessons I run a group every week for a few hours where I put people through their paces,\" Mark says. The pair have benefited immensely from learning BSL, but \"it was surprisingly tiring\". \"I'm fit and heathy and was still finding it tough going - we were knackered from it,\" Mark says.There were classes three times a week and then homework and revision in the evening. The group started by learning the alphabet and numbers which came in handy when the residents hosted a signed bingo evening.The lessons also proved useful in unexpected ways.\"At medical appointments we realised we could sign to each other to communicate something privately,\" explains Mark.Rogan ProductionsTina is one of five participants from the show who have passed their BSL Level 1 Since the documentary aired, the couple have helped turn Hughenden Gardens into a hub of deaf awareness. \"We are running deaf classes, building links with local deaf community and investigating new technologies to help people with hearing problems,\" Mark says. A monthly Deaf Café has been launched and a Jewish Deaf Association group of 29 people is due to visit the village later this month. It's also bought residents closer together and fostered a sense of community as \"there's nothing like adversity to help a team gel,\" according to Mark. Rogan ProductionsThe impact is being felt far beyond Hughenden.Mark says: \"Since March we've had many interesting visitors - one from Canada and there's a deaf club in another retirement village where there are 20 people all learning BSL.The retirement village is now focusing on how to be more deaf inclusive. Plans include deaf awareness training for all staff, new deaf-friendly entry intercoms, improved signage and the rollout of SignLive, a deaf-led video interpreting app.While Mark continues to transform the retirement village, Tina is pleased that BSL has helped her regain confidence and improve her communication. And the ripple effect continues. \"Our family all watched the documentary,\" says Mark. \"And people come up to us in the streets to say we've inspired people to take it up.\"",

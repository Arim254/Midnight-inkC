    "body": "Backed by his family, propelled by his talent - the rise of NorrisImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris, aged 14, celebrating success in the 2014 Ginetta Junior Championship, where he made his car racing debutByF1 CorrespondentLando Norris has become Britain's 11th Formula 1 world champion, and delivered on a destiny that seemed set since he was a young boy.The 26-year-old, whose father Adam is a multimillionaire who made his fortune as a pensions trader, started racing karts at the age of eight, and was on pole position for his first national event.Norris, who has dual Belgian nationality through his mother Cisca, was born in Bristol and grew up in Glastonbury. Educated at Millfield in Somerset, as his career blossomed, it became increasingly hard to find time to attend school, and there was a fair bit of home tutoring involved.His junior career marked him out as a potential future F1 world champion. His family's resources ensured he was provided with everything he needed to allow his talent to flourish. And when he made it to F1, he immediately proved he had what it took.'Everyone tells me he's the greatest thing since sliced bread'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aged 11, competing in the MSA British Cadet Kart Championship at Whilton Mill in September 2011Norris has won the title in his seventh season, and spent his entire F1 career with McLaren, with whom he has kept faith as they have grown from also-rans to F1's leading team.His boss there is American Zak Brown, McLaren Racing's chief executive officer, who has been involved with Norris since before either were at the team.Norris' career was funded by his father until he reached F1, and he was guided through his karting years by his manager Mark Berryman.But when Norris took his first steps in car racing, they did not have the necessary contacts. They turned to Brown - then the boss of a sports marketing agency called JMI, and well known in F1 as a deal maker and sponsor finder.Initially, Brown felt \"this is not what I do\". But Norris' team were persistent. Brown says: \"I thought: 'All right, everyone tells me he is the greatest thing since sliced bread, maybe I can help.'\"When Brown started paying attention, he realised Norris was the real deal \"pretty much right away\".He was not the only one. Stephanie Carlin started working with Norris as he made his first steps in the junior categories aged 15, continued to do so until he made it to F1 four years later, and is now McLaren's F1 business operations director.\"He was just phenomenally quick,\" she says, \"and he was able to execute it really well. There's been an underlying talent and speed and pace that's existed from the first time he got in a car.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shortly after his 14th birthday, Norris receives a trophy from three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart at the 2013 Autosport Awards'Welcome to Formula 1'Norris was almost certainly too good not to make it to F1, but his path was eased considerably when Brown joined McLaren in 2016, a couple of years after he started working with Norris.In January 2018, Brown paired 18-year-old Norris with then McLaren driver Fernando Alonso, an F1 legend, in the Daytona 24 Hours sportscar race in his United Autosports team.Norris gave himself the target of setting a faster lap than Alonso - and achieved it. He stunned people with his pace in the wet at night before the car eventually retired.\"Fernando Alonso, one of the best racing drivers in the world, Lando was his match,\" Brown says. \"Cold tyres, middle of the night Daytona, if you asked Richard Dean, who ran them, who was better, he wouldn't know.\"When Alonso announced he was quitting F1 at the end of 2018, Norris was the obvious replacement, and McLaren started giving him experience in practice sessions.Having proved faster than one McLaren race driver, Stoffel Vandoorne, in his first outing, his next was at Monza, with Alonso in the other car.Brown recalls: \"They're swapping times. Fernando has just set his time, so he's done, and obviously paying attention to what times Lando is doing. He's asking.\"We come on the radio and we go: 'Fernando, Lando's on a lap, get out of his way.'\"First sector, same 10th. Second sector, Lando is half a 10th up. Third sector, on the radio, Fernando: 'Sorry, I didn't see him.' Lando: 'Fernando just blocked me!' And we all just giggled on the pit wall, like, 'Welcome to Formula 1.'\"So when you see those things, you just think: 'This guy's mega.'\"'You are a star - a rock star'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Don't try this at home: Stirring a cup of tea he has made for Fernando Alonso with a power tool at the 2018 United States Grand Prix in AustinA few races later, Norris jokingly served Alonso a cup of tea during a wet practice session at the US Grand Prix in Austin. Soon, he was the apprentice no longer.In his debut season in 2019, Norris was immediately a match for his team-mate Carlos Sainz, who had four years' experience, and he destroyed then seven-time race-winner Daniel Ricciardo when the Australian joined the team in 2021.By then, Alonso had returned to F1 after two years in other categories. He and Norris swapped helmets. The Spaniard wrote on the one he gave to Norris: \"You are a star - a rock star.\"Norris quickly became a fan favourite, with his diffident-but-jokey personality, and willingness to show his true self on social media. His public profile built through the pandemic as he live-streamed himself playing video games, and he used that to build his own gaming and lifestyle brand.Brown says: \"He used to be very shy and he still kind of is a quiet, shy guy in his own way. Even though he kind of comes off as extroverted, he's actually not. But as he's become more mature, I have seen him become more comfortable in his skin.\"He has never lacked confidence. He was a young kid when I first met him, he was 14. So what I've seen outside of becoming a better racing driver, (is) a better team leader, more prescriptive in what he wants. And his on-track performance has grown with it.\"How Norris became front-runnerImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Left to right: George Russell, Lando Norris and Charles Leclerc in 2017, before all three made their F1 debutsNorris based himself in Woking, the location of the McLaren factory, when he first graduated to F1, the better to integrate with the team, but after three years he took the traditional F1 driver's life decision and moved to Monaco for financial reasons.By then, it had long been obvious Norris' talent marked him out as one of the leading lights of the new generation of drivers, along with his compatriot George Russell and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.But it has taken time for Norris to establish himself as a front-runner in F1.In their first few years together, the McLaren car was not competitive, although Norris came close to a win with a superb performance in Russia in 2021, only to misjudge the incoming weather and not pit for wet tyres in a late downpour.Norris kept the faith, signing two contract extensions, despite interest from Red Bull. That, Brown says, was down to \"relationships, transparency, visibility to what we were doing. He's comfortable here. This has been his family since day one.\"Norris' career trajectory turned midway through 2023, a year that started with a restructuring of McLaren's engineering group by Andrea Stella, who had accepted Brown's offer to become team principal the previous December.'I just could not believe his development'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris' maiden F1 victory in Miami in 2024 came in his 110th grand prixCarlin joined McLaren at the beginning of 2024. It had been more than five years since she had worked with Norris in F2.\"I sat in engineering and heard him giving feedback,\" she says, \"and I was blown away. I just could not believe the development of this teenager I'd known, a very successful F2 driver and champion in F3 and F4. It was incredible.\"Those first five years in F1 had turned a boy into a man, and a promising driver full of potential into one of the best in the world. But there was still learning to be done.After a slow start to 2024, a development to the McLaren car at the Miami Grand Prix in May made the team absolutely competitive. Norris took his maiden win that weekend, and later three further victories as it began to look as if he could challenge for the title.In the end, the head start Red Bull's Max Verstappen had established in the first five races of the year was too much. A few small Norris errors along the way did not help.A year on, Norris' development has continued apace.\"Lando has always been really open about what he feels his weaknesses are as much as what he feels his strengths are,\" Carlin says.\"That's one of the things that's attracted the most negative publicity around him because he's been so open about that. And because he's open about it, people see it as a weakness. But actually what it's turning out to be is his absolute strength.\"He's used it as a development tool. He's used it throughout his career and then he's really used it this year because at the start of the season he was struggling to adapt to the characteristics of the car and he looked like he was, to the rest of the world, questioning himself.\"What he was actually doing was developing himself. And that's really been demonstrated this season.\"Some stumbles, then a surge to the titleNorris started this year with a win in Australia, but after that the first part of the season was a struggle. His team-mate Oscar Piastri had progressed significantly through some assiduous work with the team over the winter, and Norris was not feeling the car in the way he needed to be quick.Developments over the winter had made the new car faster, but introduced what the drivers called a \"numbness\" to the front axle, which was preventing Norris' ability to exploit the car.A tweak to the front suspension was developed to improve Norris' feel, and introduced in Canada in June. It was not an overnight fix, and was relatively minor in nature, but undoubtedly after that the trend line of Norris' trajectory was a positive one.Despite falling 34 points behind Piastri at the end of August, Norris has clinched the title just nine races later.Norris attributes his resilience to the \"good group of people around me, to support me, to direct me, help me, whether it's been a good weekend or a bad weekend, people who always have my best interest at heart and are there to give me the right mentality when I'm down.\"Two reasons I've done well are: one, I've done a better job, so I'm performing better more often; and two, I'm not always more positive, but I'm more positive and less negative about when I have bad days and bad sessions. And I believe in myself a bit more that I can turn it around.\"A lot of work away from the track with different people. A lot of work at the track. But it all starts with my team around me.\"Stella has a phrase for this. He calls it \"acknowledging the gap to perfection\" - a description he has used for Alonso's approach to his career. It means that however good a driver is, they look to their weaknesses, and work on mitigating them. It is a constantly evolving process.F1 drivers generally don't talk about this stuff, and if they do it tends to be in an allusive manner that tries to hide any weaknesses.Carlin says: \"He doesn't see that as a weakness because he's such an authentic, genuine person. It's not even in his nature to hide that process.\"To some extent, you've got to be in the environment to challenge you. And although Lando's had a few seasons in F1 now, he's not had multiple seasons in condition to be a championship contender.\"So he's continued to develop through his F1 career, but to some extent the rate of your development is constrained by the extent of your potential. And if your potential is limited by various factors, such as your car and relative pace to other teams, then that has an impact on how far you can develop at what pace.\"But when he's been delivered with a car capable of challenging for the championship, his own development has accelerated to match that.\"So it's with those great opportunities and those greatest challenges that his development rate has actually sped up, to kind of mirror-image that.\"Which should mean there is more to come.This is an updated version of an article first published in March 2025",

Its nightlife, sandy beaches, and resorts attract millions of tourists annually.Eyewitnesses told the BBC of scenes of panic in the bustling nightlife area.One said that he had been outside the club on what was a usual Saturday night with holidaymakers enjoying themselves when he heard screams.\"I didn't initially understand what was going on,\" he said. \"In a bit, it became clear that a massive fire had broken out. The scenes were just horrific.\" Though the main entrance is wide, the crossing over a small lake leading to the main structure is narrow and that made it difficult for firefighters to reach the spot.The BBC saw what appeared to be melted remains of chairs, tables and plants in one corner of the club.EPAPolice believe a gas cylinder exploded in the club's kitchen, causing a blaze to rip through the venueLocal police chief Alok Kumar said the fire had been concentrated in the kitchen area on the ground floor. Goa's chief minister Pramod Sawant told journalists three people had died from burns, while others had died of suffocation. Six others are in a stable condition in hospital.Officials said 20 of the workers who died were from the Indian states of Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka. One worker was from Nepal. Four of the victims were tourists from Delhi, they added. A chef who works at a nearby venue told the BBC he knew some of the workers at the Birch club.\"People from all over the country and also from Nepal work in different clubs in Goa,\" he said.\"I am really worried for some people who I knew at the club. Their phones are off.On Sunday, emergency teams were combing through the charred wreckage.An inquiry into the cause of the fire has been launched, the chief minister said.\"Those found responsible will face most stringent action under the law – any negligence will be dealt with firmly,\" Dr Sawant added.India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the Goa fire \"deeply saddening\" in a post on social media.A rescue operation and investigation was ongoing at the Goa nightclub on Sunday morningAbout 5.5 million tourists visited Goa in the first half of the year, government data showed, with 270,000 coming from abroad.Some opposition politicians told the BBC that stricter regulations were needed to avoid such tragedies.They alleged that newer clubs were opening too frequently and the government needed to ensure they were safe for people to visit.India has seen a number of deadly fires at entertainment venues in recent years.A fire at a three-storey building killed 17 in the southern city of Hyderabad in May, while a hotel blaze in north-east Kolkata left 15 dead a month earlier.Last year, 24 died at an amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat after visitors were trapped inside. An official review later found poor safety standards contributed to the death toll.",

The greeting inside reads \"Wishing you a very happy Christmas and New Year\".The King - standing on the left - is wearing a dark blue suit and grey tie, while the Queen is wearing a white and beige coat dress.This photograph is their fourth Christmas card since Charles became King.The image, captured by photographer Chris Jackson, was taken in the grounds of the Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's residence in Rome.It was taken to mark the King and Queen's 20th wedding anniversary.The Queen is also wearing a lily of the valley brooch, a symbol of enduring love.This year's photograph, like last year's, is a more informal picture than the one chosen for Christmas 2023.Last year's picture was captured by Millie Pilkington, and was taken as the King returned to public duties following his cancer diagnosis and treatment.The couple were pictured smiling in the garden of Buckingham Palace on what appeared to be a sunny day.In 2023, the King and Queen chose a photograph of themselves in the Throne Room at Buckingham Palace following the coronation.Christmas images used to decorate official festive cards are regularly released by senior members of the Royal Family.It will take the royal couple several days to personally sign all the cards, which will be sent to people across the globe including family, friends, world leaders and organisations.",

Opus ConservationThe palace is hoping to link people whose parents or grandparents may have scribbled their names on the ceiling during previous workThe palace wants to hear from anyone who can help link the names with previous work on the ceilings.Lizzie Woolley, director of Opus Conservation, said: \"We were excited to discover these pieces of graffiti. We didn't have any documentary evidence of previous work to the Great Hall and Saloon and these are a tantalising clue as to what was done, and when. \"It would be brilliant to solve the mystery of who these people were, and what they were doing in the Great Hall.\"Amongst the scribbles and scratched names are:F.

Rushed rollouts meant \"accepting a high level of fraud risk, without plans for managing or mitigating this risk,\" it will say.Details of the report were first published by the Sunday Mirror.In September the government launched a voluntary repayment scheme for people and businesses to return pandemic scheme money with no questions asked until the end of December.Mr Hayhoe has been tasked by Chancellor Rachel Reeves with trying to recover the public money lost to fraud and underperforming contracts using his experience in procurement as the former chair of an NHS trust.His previous reports found that pandemic-era PPE contracts cost the British taxpayer £1.4bn on undelivered contracts and unusable gowns, masks and gloves.Only a small fraction of that - £182m - has been recovered by HM Treasury.The National Crime Agency is separately investigating possible criminal offences committed in the PPE procurement system.",

    "body": "A protective shield covering the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine can no longer provide its main containment function following a drone strike earlier this year, according to a UN watchdog.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors found that the massive structure, built over the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster, had lost its \"primary safety functions including the confinement capability\".In February, Ukraine accused Russia of targeting the power plant - a claim the Kremlin denied.The IAEA said repairs were \"essential\" to \"prevent further degradation\" of the nuclear shelter. However environmental expert Jim Smith told the BBC: \"It is not something to panic about.\"Prof Smith from the University of Portsmouth in the UK, who has studied the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, said the biggest danger linked to the site was disturbing radioactive dust.But he said that \"the risk is low\" because contaminated dust is contained within a thick concrete \"sarcophagus\" which is covered by the protective shield. The 1986 explosion at Chernobyl blasted radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.In response, the former Soviet Union constructed the sarcophagus over the nuclear reactor. The sarcophagus only had a 30-year lifespan, prompting the need for the protective shell to prevent radioactive material leaking out over the next 100 years.The IAEA said a team had completed a safety assessment of the site last week after it was \"severely damaged\" by the drone strike. The attack caused a fire in the outer cladding of the steel structure.Inspectors said there was no permanent damage to shell's load-bearing structures or monitoring systems and some repairs had been carried out on the roof.But IAEA director general Rafael Grossi, said: \"Timely and comprehensive restoration remains essential to prevent further degradation and ensure long-term nuclear safety.\"Since the beginning of December, the UN's nuclear watchdog has been assessing Ukraine's energy infrastructure as the country continues to defend itself against Russia.Overnight, Russia launched airstrikes on the city of Kremenchuk, a major industrial hub in the centre of Ukraine. As well as assessing Chernobyl, the IAEA has been inspecting electrical substations linked to nuclear safety and security.Mr Grossi said: \"They are absolutely indispensable for providing the electricity all nuclear power plants need for reactor cooling and other safety systems.\"They are also needed to distribute the electricity that they produce to households and industry.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporterKaty Perry and former Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau have gone Instagram official after the singer posted a string of photographs and videos of their trip to Japan.In one picture, Perry and Trudeau are seen smiling for a selfie, with their faces touching. In another video, the pair are seen trying sushi.Neither Perry nor Trudeau have publicly commented on their relationship. But speculation has been growing for months with multiple pictures of the two together.Trudeau was seen attending Perry's concert earlier this year, fuelling rumours of a romance with the pop star.Perry was visiting Japan as part of her global Lifetimes Tour.The 41-year-old accompanied her Instagram carousel with the caption: \"Tokyo times on tour and more.\"Earlier this week, Trudeau, 53, also reposted a photograph of the pair together alongside the former prime minister of Japan, Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko.He wrote on X: \"Great to see you [Fumio Kishida]. Katy and I were so glad to have the chance to sit down with you and Yuko.\"Thank you, Fumio, for your friendship and your continued commitment to both the international rules-based order and to a better future for everyone.\"Last month, the pair appeared to confirm their relationship after being photographed holding hands at an event in Paris.Celebrity news site TMZ published the photographs and video footage of the pair walking hand-in-hand before getting into a car. Trudeau was seen helping the singer into the back seat as photographers called out.The appearance in Paris coincided with Perry's 41st birthday and appeared to mark their first public outing as a couple.Perry and Trudeau did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.During a recent tour in London, Perry did appear to allude to her relationship status.After a fan proposed to her from the audience during a performance, the singer joked: \"I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.\" This was just days after photographs of her and Trudeau were first published online.Perry was previously in a long-term relationship with actor Orlando Bloom. The pair, who were together for a decade and share a daughter, separated over the summer.Trudeau, who served as prime minister of Canada from 2015 to 2025, was previously married to Sophie Grégoire for 18 years before the couple split up in the summer of 2023. They share three children.",

Earlier in the day trains were delayed and the car park was closed due to the incident but it reopened by 11:30 GMT.Police and emergency services were called at 08:11 to the multi-storey car park at Terminal 3.Tom Bate was waiting for a lift in the Terminal 3 car park when he saw \"young men dressed in black darting through the crowd\" before going through a side door.\"As soon as they left people started coughing, and then I started to cough,\" he told the BBC. \"I felt a burning at the back of my throat.\"Driving out of the car park, he said he saw police arriving. \"It was an amazing thing to see the police running to danger,\" he said. \"I'm so glad to hear now that it's not terrorism because it felt like I was in the middle of an attack - it was pretty intense.\"Social media footage showed a large armed police response, fire engines and an officer appearing to search a handcuffed individual.Fin Fraser, who flew into Heathrow from the US on Sunday morning, told the BBC he saw \"armed police running around and checking people's vehicles\" as he was attempting to leave the car park.\"When they came to ours, they knocked on our window and told us to wind it down and then they looked inside the car.\"Describing it as a \"surreal experience,\" he added: \"It felt like I was in a James Bond movie\".There was disruption to rail services on Sunday, with Heathrow advising passengers to \"allow extra time when travelling to the airport\".The Heathrow Express and parts of the Elizabeth Line were suspended on Sunday morning while responders attended the scene but resumed running later in the morning.Heathrow has advised passengers to \"allow extra time when travelling to the airport and to check with their airline for any queries\". Due to congestion on surrounding roads following the incident, the airport has advised passengers to use public transport.Airport staff handed bottles of water to passengers waiting for buses from Terminal 3, where one family told PA news agency they had been waiting at the bus stop for three hours for a shuttle to the long-stay car park after their flight. Shuttles usually run every 15 minutes.",

    "body": "Russia has welcomed Donald Trump's new US National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. The 33-page document, unveiled by the US administration last week, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. \"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency TASS on Sunday. \"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its response to Moscow in ending the war. In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. \"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Wadephul said on Friday. \"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany,\" he added.In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".The US has been growing closer to the far-right AfD party in Germany, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership.",

    "body": "Just nowNoor NanjiGetty ImagesPhotographer Martin Parr, whose colourful images captured British life, has died at the age of 73.He died on Saturday at his home in Bristol, the director of the Martin Parr Foundation, Jenni Smith, told BBC News.In a statement, the foundation said he would \"be greatly missed\" and was survived by his wife Susie, daughter Ellen, sister and grandson. It added the family asked for privacy.The documentary photographer rose to prominence in the mid 1980s, with The Last Resort, his study of working class people on holiday in New Brighton in Merseyside.Martin Parr FoundationA photograph from New Brighton, England, 1983-85, from 'The Last Resort'Parr's works were known for capturing the smallest details of everyday life. His photographs were playful and had humour, but also provoked debate and discussion.\"I make serious photographs disguised as entertainment,\" he told The Architectural Review in 2020.\"I try to point out when I find universal truths. Truth is subjective, but it's the world how I found it.\"Watch: I Am Martin Parr - on BBC iPlayerFor more than 50 years, Parr's photographs observed with an apparently flat but amused and sympathetic eye the quiet rituals and absurdities of his home country, from desolate seaside towns to village fetes and modern shopping centres.He was known for using a colour saturated palette that mimicked postcards from the 1950s and 1960s.The shots he took in New Brighton were meant to be about capturing a moment in time and challenging people's perceptions of social classes.Martin Parr FoundationA photograph from New Brighton, England, 1983-85, from 'The Last Resort'The collection showcased the best - and worst - days at the seaside, with pictures of day trippers enjoying picnics among the litter and rundown amenities which characterised the Wirral town at the time.But those famous seaside shots became very controversial, as he himself acknowledged earlier this year ahead of a new film about his life.\"People from London and the South East, they really didn't know what places in the North looked like,\" said Parr, now 72.\"The litter was quite terrible, but they just weren't used to it, so it was almost like it was my fault that the place looked so scruffy.\"Martin Parr FoundationA photograph from O'Connell Bridge, Dublin, 1981, from 'Bad Weather'Last month, in an interview with AFP, he warned the world needs the kind of satire captured in his images more than ever.\"The state we're all in is appalling,\" he said. \"We're all too rich. We're consuming all these things in the world. And we can't. It's unsustainable.\"Photographer Diane Smyth, editor of the British Journal of Photography, called Parr a \"giant of post-war photography\" in a tribute posted on Instagram.\"He was a hoot - always up for a call, especially if it was very early, and always very direct. He did he own thing, worked incredibly hard, helped others along the way - a life well-lived.\"Jonathan Stephenson, who collaborated on art and design projects with Parr over the years, told BBC News he died peacefully watching football, adding he was \"a firm and loyal friend\".\"It was a massive privilege  - and continually inspiring - to engage with Martin's eyes and mind,\" he said. \"Martin's enthusiasm for everyday life was infectious.\"",

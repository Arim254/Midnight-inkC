    "body": "US President Donald Trump has unveiled renovations to the bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom, as his remodelling of the White House continues.Trump shared photos of the new bathroom on social media, saying it had been \"renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era\".He claimed the new black and white marble is \"very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!\".It is the latest change Trump has made to the White House this year. In October, its East Wing was demolished to make way for his new multi-million dollar ballroom.The bathroom is a part of Abraham Lincoln's office and cabinet room, which former President Harry Truman fixed up as a part of his massive renovation of the White House in the late 1940s. The wallpaper of Lincoln's office and bedroom was once coloured in green and gold, according to the White House Historical Association. After Trump's remodelling, it now features gold fixtures and accents for the sink, bathtub faucet and shower door, as well as a chandelier. The US president's attempts to put his own stamp on the White House has prompted criticism from conservation groups and his political opponents.  Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the East Wing would not \"interfere with the current building\". But in October, he said the \"existing structure\" had to be torn down. Conservationists argued Trump should have sought public review before making the changes, which they say would overwhelm the classical style of the White House. Other changes include his decision in August to pave over grass in the iconic Rose Garden with stone, transforming a lawn into a patio. Trump also added touches of gilded gold all over the Oval Office, including additional portraits framed in gold, gold-framed mirrors and a gold leaf for the presidential seal on the ceiling of the office.In response to his latest bathroom renovation, the Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on remaking the White House than solving the government shutdown, which is now entering its second month. \"Donald Trump actually cares more about his toilet than he does about fixing your healthcare,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on social media. Democrats are pushing to renew expiring health insurance subsidies, which they say will hit American families. Republicans say they will discuss the subsidies when the government reopens.",

    "description": "Americans are expected to see skyrocketing health care prices as the open enrollment period for insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace ",
    "body": "Americans are expected to see skyrocketing health care prices as the open enrollment period for insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace begins on Saturday. About 24 million people buy health insurance through the marketplace, the majority of whom used to receive tax credits to lower the monthly price of insurance.Without credits, the monthly cost could rise by 114% on average, according to health research nonprofit KFF. This could mean an extra $1,000 a year, and in some cases much more. Democrats have demanded the healthcare subsidies, which expire at the end of the year, be extended in exchange for ending the month-long federal government shutdown. Republican leaders have argued the health insurance issue should be dealt with separately, and after the government reopens. Though some conservative lawmakers have expressed concerns with the subsidies ending.  For those who have previously made use of the tax credits, the new costs could be a shock. Stacy Cox and her husband, who are small business owners in Utah, were paying $495 (£376) a month for health insurance. Ms Cox said that without the tax credits, their monthly premiums are estimated to rise to $2,168, a 338% increase.\"It's horrific to actually see real numbers,\" she said.If the subsidies are not extended, Ms Cox said she and her husband will cancel their health plan and buy some type of emergency insurance, which would not cover any of their routine and preventative health care costs. The back-up plan is worrying for Ms Cox, who has an autoimmune disease, and her husband, who has hereditary cardiovascular disease. \"It's horribly stressful, because what I know is that the emergency plan is not going to cover what I need,\" she said. Experts say that about seven million people like Ms Cox are expected to stop buying health insurance through the marketplace if the tax credits end. Of those, around four to five million are expected to lose health care coverage altogether because they won't be able to find other means, some experts suggest.Lawmakers remain at an impasse over the issue, as they enter the second month of the government shutdown. Democrats are seeking to renew the subsidies and reverse steep cuts President Donald Trump made to Medicaid, the government-run programme which provides healthcare insurance for low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people with disabilities.Some Republican lawmakers have criticised the subsidies as a part of Obamacare legislation that they do not support.  But at least a few conservative lawmakers have said they want the tax credits to continue, including Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has said she is \"absolutely disgusted\" by the subsidies ending. Americans were also facing the possibility of a suspension of food aid used by more than 40 million people, because of the government shutdown. But judges on Friday ruled that the Trump administration must pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits using emergency funds.President Donald Trump reacted to the legal decision via Truth Social on Friday, saying: \"our government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do.\"I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,\" he said.",

    "body": "15 hours agoTabby WilsonAFP via Getty ImagesLizard Island is about 250km (155 miles) north of CairnsA 60-day cruise around Australia has been cancelled days after the death of an elderly female passenger who was left behind by the ship on a remote island.Suzanne Rees had been hiking on Lizard Island with fellow passengers from the Coral Adventurer, but broke off from the group for a rest. The ship left without her and returned several hours later after the crew realised the woman was missing.A major search operation found her body the following day.The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (Amsa) is investigating the incident, alongside Queensland Police and the state coroner.The CEO of the cruise operator Coral Expeditions, Mark Fifield, said on Saturday that passengers and crew on the Coral Adventurer were told on Wednesday that the remainder of the voyage had been cancelled due to the \"tragic passing of Suzanne Rees and previous mechanical issues\".He added in a statement that passengers would be issued a full refund, and said Coral Expeditions was working \"to co-ordinate the return journeys of the passengers via chartered flights\".Amsa also released an updated statement on Saturday, saying it had \"issued a notice to the Master of Coral Adventurer\" prohibiting any new passengers from boarding the ship.The spokesperson said that officials would attend the vessel in Cairns upon its return.The ship initially left the north-western city on 24 October, and was just two days into the voyage at the time of the 80-year-old's death. Lizard Island was the first stop on the journey.Passengers aboard - who typically pay tens of thousands of dollars to join the cruise - were transported there for a day trip with the option of hiking or snorkelling.Suzanne Rees' daughter, Katherine Rees, said on Thursday that her family was \"shocked and saddened that the Coral Adventurer left Lizard Island after an organised excursion without my mum\".She described her mother as an \"active 80-year-old\" who was a member of a bushwalking group.\"From the little we have been told, it seems that there was a failure of care and common sense.\"Ms Rees added that she hoped the coroner's inquiry would be able to pinpoint what \"the company should have done that might have saved mum's life\".\"We understand from the police that it was a very hot day, and mum fell ill on the hill climb,\" she said.\"She was asked to head down, unescorted. Then the ship left, apparently without doing a passenger count.\"At some stage in that sequence, or shortly after, mum died, alone.\"Earlier this week, Mr Fifield confirmed that Coral Expeditions was \"working closely with Queensland Police and other authorities to support their investigation\".He said that the company was \"deeply sorry that this has occurred\" and had offered its full support to the Rees family.The Coral Adventurer caters for up to 120 guests with 46 crew, according to the company's website. It was purpose-built to access remote areas of Australia's coast and is equipped with \"tenders\" - small boats used to take passengers on day excursions.Incidents like this are rare, and cruise ships have systems to record which passengers are embarking or disembarking, Harriet Mallinson, cruise editor of travel website Sailawaze, told the BBC.\"Sneaking ashore or [back] on board just isn't an option,\" she said.Cruise lines take these procedures very seriously and have \"clever tech in place to prevent such incidents from happening\", Ms Mallinson added. \"This is most likely a shocking - and tragic - one-off.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoGetty ImagesThousands of people from some of Scotland's most deprived areas are to be offered free weight-loss jabs as part of government-funded research.Up to 5,000 people in Scotland will take the injections as part of the multi-million pound study being led by Glasgow University.The findings will provide insight into the lives of people living with obesity and health inequalities across the UK.If successful, it could lead to a wider rollout of the injections throughout the country.The jabs copy or boost the effects of natural hormones called incretins, which control blood sugar levels.They act on areas of the brain which impact hunger and appetite and can slow down how fast the stomach empties. This may help people living with obesity regulate their eating habits.The UK government has provided an initial £650,000 for the Scotland CardioMetabolic Impact Study (SCoMIS).As a leading cause of long-term illness such as heart disease and cancer, tackling obesity will help millions live longer healthier lives and reduce the pressure on health services, potentially saving the NHS billions annually.UK Health Innovation Minister Dr Zubir Ahmed said: \"As a practicing NHS surgeon and Glasgow MP, I know firsthand the impact of the obesity crisis that plagues Scotland – and the litany of health problems it leads to.\"More than 1 in 3 adults in Scotland's most deprived areas are living with obesity. The UK government is committed to tackling inequality wherever it finds it in our country. \"It's why this landmark UK government investment is targeting help where it's needed most in Scotland and meeting people where they are and backing helping the NHS services they trust to treat them.\"Aims of the study:To test how weight‑loss medicines can be delivered effectively and fairly in everyday NHS care. To measure the level of weight loss and improvements in quality of life, particularly for patients in disadvantaged areas.To examine the impact on obesity‑related illness, NHS use, and overall healthcare costs.To explore whether better health through weight loss can help people stay in work, reduce sick leave, and take a fuller part in society.Jason Gill, professor of cardiometabolic health at Glasgow University, who is leading the study, said: \"While tackling obesity requires multifactorial public health action, incretin therapies add a powerful new tool to the national obesity strategy. \"The burden of obesity is greatest in the most deprived segments of society and the status quo risks widening health inequalities.\"SCoMIS aims to be a landmark real‑world study evaluating a new model of obesity care, providing incretin treatment via primary and community care to Scottish adults living with obesity, with a focus on those in the most economically deprived communities.\"'Cutting-edge research'Jenni Minto, Scottish minister for public health, said the Scottish government was proud to be leading the way in tackling obesity through innovation and collaboration. \"This study places patients and communities at the heart of cutting-edge research into weight-loss medicines, ensuring we build the evidence needed to deliver the greatest benefit to those who need it most,\" she said.UK Science Minister Lord Vallance said: \"Scotland has always been at the forefront of medical innovation and public health, and this initiative is further proof of the world-class expertise that can be found here.\"By learning how these weight-loss medicines work, and how we can support them to reach our most deprived areas, we can slash health inequalities in Scotland and the rest of the UK so that our obesity strategy delivers a real, lasting change.\"The study, which will be launched next year, also involves industry leaders Novo Nordisk and IQVIA, as well as clinical leaders at the Universities of Dundee and Edinburgh.They will work out how to make best use of AI driven digital technologies to support patient access, engagement and data collection.The study will involve 3,000 to 5,000 Scottish patients living with obesity who will benefit from the medicines the most.",

    "body": "8 hours agoJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondent, in KyivReutersUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said the defence of Pokrovsk is a \"priority\", as elite special forces were deployed to the embattled town on the eastern front line.Ukrainian army sources told the BBC that special forces from military intelligence and assault groups were being used as regular infantry to protect supply lines to troops holding the town in the Donbas region.There have been growing reports of Russian advances around the strategic town to the west of Donetsk. Ukraine has denied claims their forces were surrounded.Moscow wants Kyiv to cede the entire Donbas region as part of a peace deal, including the parts it currently does not control.Russia currently controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory, including the Crimean peninsula it annexed in 2014.The deployment of special forces suggests officials in Kyiv are determined to try to hold on to the town, which Russia has been trying to seize for more than a year.Local media say the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, was in the region to personally oversee the operation.Pokrovsk is a key transport and supply hub whose capture could unlock Russian efforts to seize the rest of the region.But Kyiv also believes its capture would help Russia in its efforts to persuade the US that its military campaign is succeeding - and, therefore, that the West should acquiesce to its demands.Washington has grown increasingly frustrated with the Kremlin's failure to move forward with peace negotiations - culminating in US President Donald Trump placing sanctions on two largest Russian oil producers and axing plans for a summit with President Vladimir Putin.Zelensky has indicated he is open to Trump's proposal for a ceasefire that would freeze the war along the current front lines. Russia has publicly insisted Ukrainian troops leave the remainder of the Donbas.In his nightly address, the Ukrainian president said: \"Pokrovsk is our priority. We continue to destroy the occupier, and that is what matters most... They must be halted where they have reached - and destroyed there.\"ReutersRussia claimed to have killed Ukrainian special forces who landed near the town by helicopterImages shared with news agencies appear to show a Ukrainian Black Hawk helicopter deploying about 10 troops near Pokrovsk, although the location and date could not be verified.Russia's defence ministry said it had thwarted the deployment of Ukrainian military intelligence special forces north-west of the town, killing all 11 troops who landed by helicopter.DeepState, a Ukrainian open-source monitoring group, estimates about half of Pokrovsk is a so-called \"grey zone\" where neither side is in full control.A military source in Donetsk told the BBC that Ukrainian forces were not surrounded but their supply lines were under fire from Russian troops.\"The situation in the city has changed so much that [Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Gen Oleksandr] Syrsky is now sending elite units into the city to stabilise it,\" he said.These included special forces and assault units in Ukraine's Defence Intelligence agency (GUR), he said.\"Fighting is now taking place for the railway station and the industrial zone in the west. The battles for the industrial zone have almost reduced logistics from roughly vehicle-based to foot-based. \"The Ukrainian Armed Forces are not in a physical encirclement, but in an operational one - this means that all logistics are under fire control.\"The US-based Institute for the Study of War said Ukrainian forces had \"marginally advanced\" during recent counter-attacks north of Pokrovsk, but said the town was \"mainly a contested 'grey zone'\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoCachella Smith and Will Grant,Reporting from KingstonEPA/ShutterstockBlack River was one of the worst hit areas by Hurricane Melissa with residents previously telling the BBC they have lived in a state of chaos since the stormA flight carrying British aid arrived in Jamaica early on Saturday to help with recovery efforts after Hurricane Melissa, as the UK plans its first chartered flight to bring British nationals home later on Saturday.The aid flight brought more than 3,000 emergency shelter kits as part of a £7.5m regional emergency package.Part of the funding will be used to match public donations up to £1m to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent - with King Charles and Queen Camilla among those who have donated.Despite aid arriving in Jamaica in recent days, fallen trees and landslides have complicated distribution after Hurricane Melissa devastated parts of the island, killing at least 19 people.The hurricane made landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday as a category five storm and was one of the most powerful hurricanes ever measured in the Caribbean.Melissa swept across the region over a number of days and left behind a trail of destruction and dozens of people dead. In Haiti, at least 30 people were killed, while Cuba also saw flooding and landslides.Jamaica's Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon said on Friday \"there are entire communities that seem to be marooned and areas that seem to be flattened\".The UK initially set aside a £2.5 million immediate financial support package, with an additional £5 million announced by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Friday.Cooper said the announcement came as \"more information is now coming through on the scale of devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, with homes damaged, roads blocks and lives lost\".The British Red Cross said the King and Queen's donation would help the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) \"continue its lifesaving work\" - which includes search and rescue efforts in Jamaica as well as ensuring access to healthcare, safe shelter and clean water.The Red Cross said, as of Saturday morning, that 72% of people across Jamaica still do not have electricity and around 6,000 are in emergency shelters.Until the Jamaican government can get the broken electricity grid back up and running, any generators aid agencies can distribute will be vital. So too will tarpaulins, given the extent of the housing crisis.Meanwhile, with so many in need of clean drinking water and basic food, patience is wearing thin and there are more reports of desperate people entering supermarkets to gather and give out whatever food they can find.The BBC has seen queues for petrol pumps, with people waiting for hours to then be told there is no fuel left when they reach the front of the queue.Some people are seeking fuel for generators, others for a car to reach an area in which they can contact people, with the power down across most of the island.AFP via Getty ImagesParts of St Elizabeth have experienced flooding in recent daysThe country's health minister, Dr Christopher Tufton, on Saturday described \"significant damage\" across a number of hospitals - with the Black River Hospital in St Elizabeth being the most severely affected.\"That facility will have to be for now totally relocated in terms of services,\" he said.\"The immediate challenge of the impacted hospitals is to preserve accident and emergency services,\" Dr Tufton added. \"What we're seeing is that a lot of people are coming in now to these facilities with trauma-related [injuries] from falls from the roof, to ladders, to nails penetrating their feet\".The minister said arrangements had been made for the ongoing supply of fuel to the facilities as well as a \"daily supply of water\".Although aid is entering the country, landslides, downed power lines and fallen trees have made certain roads impassable. However, some of the worst affected areas of Jamaica should finally receive some relief in the coming hours.At least one aid organisation, Global Empowerment Mission, rolled out this morning from Kingston with a seven-truck convoy to Black River, the badly damaged town of western Jamaica, carrying packs of humanitarian assistance put together by volunteers from the Jamaican diaspora community in Florida. Help is also coming in from other aid groups and foreign governments via helicopter.It remains only a small part of what the affected communities need but authorities insist more is coming soon.Around 8,000 British nationals were thought to have been on the island when the hurricane hit.The UK's first chartered flight to bring British citizens home is set to leave Kingston's Norman Manley International Airport late on Saturday.The UK foreign office has asked travellers to register their presence on the island.The department also advises travellers to contact their airline to check whether commercial options are available.",

    "body": "9 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesAndrew was stripped of his title as a prince on ThursdayMembers of a US congressional committee investigating the Jeffrey Epstein case have intensified their calls for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor to answer questions about his links to the late sex offender.King Charles stripped his brother of his \"prince\" title on Thursday, following months of pressure over Andrew's ties to Epstein. Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.At least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told the BBC: \"If he wants to clear his name, if he wants to do right by the victims, he will come forward\".Andrew could appear remotely, have a lawyer present and could speak to the panel privately, Subramanyam said.\"Frankly, Andrew's name has come up many times from the victims,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday. \"So he clearly has knowledge of what happened and we just want him to come forward and tell us what he knows.\"He added: \"No matter who it is - American or not - everyone should be looked at.\"Fellow committee member Raja Krishnamoorthi told BBC Newsnight he would be willing to formally summon Andrew with a subpoena - although he conceded this would be difficult to enforce while he was outside of the US. Everything we know about Andrew losing titles and Windsor mansionVirginia Giuffre's family speak to BBC: \"She'd be so proud\"Read the King's statement in fullWatch: Question Time audience reacts to newsIs this finally rock bottom for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor?Why Sarah Ferguson, Beatrice and Eugenie can't escape the taint of family scandalWhere does the King get his money?He said on Friday: \"However, if Andrew wishes to come to the United States or he's here, then he's subject to the jurisdiction of the US Congress, and I would expect him to testify.\"He added: \"At the end of the day, we want to know exactly what happened, not just to give justice to the survivors, but to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\"Come clean. Come before the US Congress, voluntarily testify. Don't wait for a subpoena. Come and testify and tell us what you know.\"Congressman Stephen Lynch also told the BBC hearing from Andrew \"might be helpful in getting justice for these survivors\" but said the committee would be unable to subpoena him \"as the situation stands\".Meanwhile, Liz Stein - one of Epstein's accusers - said Andrew should \"take some initiative\" and help US investigators.She told BBC Breakfast on Saturday: \"A lot of us are curious as to why he's unwilling to cooperate and be questioned about his involvement with Epstein.\"\"If he has nothing to hide, then why is he hiding?\"\"We know he had a longstanding friendship with Epstein and that he was in his social circle - so he may have seen things during his involvement with Epstein that he could speak to.\"Another of Epstein's accusers, Anouska De Georgiou, likewise told Newsnight Andrew should appear before Congress, saying \"it would be appropriate for him to be treated the same as anybody else would be treated\".Getty ImagesLiz Stein said Andrew should step in and help investigators It comes after UK trade minister Chris Bryant told the BBC Andrew should go to the US to answer questions about Epstein's crimes if invited, \"just as with any ordinary member of the public\".Meanwhile, the police watchdog said it had approached the Metropolitan Police to ask whether there are matters it should be looking into, in light of media reports about Andrew.The Independent Office for Police Conduct said it had contacted Scotland Yard's Directorate of Professional Standards last week - which oversees internal investigations into misconduct - and had not yet received any referrals.Reports emerged in mid-October that Andrew sought to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection in 2011. He has not commented on the reports, while the Metropolitan Police previously said it was \"actively\" looking into them.Separately, new court documents published in the US on Friday showed that Andrew wrote in an email in 2010 that it would be \"good to catch up in person\" with Epstein, after he was released from prison for soliciting prostitution from a minor.The pair were then pictured together in Central Park in New York in December 2010, in a meeting that Andrew later told the BBC was to break off their friendship.Andrew's ties to Epstein were at the centre of Thursday's decision, with the Palace announcement stating: \"These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him.\"\"Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.\"In recent weeks, pressure had increased on the monarchy to resolve the issue of Charles's brother.In early October, emails which re-emerged from 2011 showed Andrew in contact with Epstein months after he claimed their friendship had ended.A posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre was also released - repeating allegations that, as a teenager, she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has always denied.And earlier this week, the King was heckled about the matter.Although Andrew denies the accusations, the Royal Family considers there have been \"serious lapses of judgement\" in his behaviour.As well as losing his titles and honours, he was ordered to move out of his Windsor mansion - Royal Lodge - and into a property on the King's Norfolk estate, paid for by the monarch.The BBC understands that he will not have to move out immediately, and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.On Saturday, a black Land Rover with a number plate ending DOY was seen leaving Bishops Gate near Royal Lodge just before 08:00 GMT.Only a driver was in the vehicle as it left the grounds of Windsor Great Park. Andrew has previously been pictured driving a vehicle with the same private number plate.",

    "body": "3 days agoTim AtkinsonSouth of EnglandNational TrustTwo entomologists said they found the spider with just nine minutes to spareA critically endangered spider, not seen in the UK for 40 years, has been rediscovered in a remote nature reserve accessible only by boat.Aulonia albimana, which was last recorded in the UK in 1985, was uncovered at the National Trust's Newtown nature reserve on the Isle of Wight - about 2km (1.2 miles) from the spider's former colony.The tiny orange-legged arachnid has informally been named the white-knuckled wolf spider by those who found it. Mark Telfer, who carried out the search with fellow entomologist Graeme Lyons, called it \"one of those unforgettable discoveries\".\"To find a species thought lost for 40 years is thrilling - and testament to how the right habitat management, combined with curiosity and collaboration, can deliver remarkable results,\" he said. Wolf spiders – of which there are about 38 species living in the UK – take their name from their agile hunting skills, which involve chasing prey along the ground before pouncing like a wolf. But the National Trust said the Aulonia albimana's hunting techniques remained something of a mystery, as the species was also known to spin a flimsy web.More stories from the south of EnglandMr Lyons said: \"I suggested calling it the white-knuckled wolf spider because this was probably the longest long shot I've ever taken part in.\"We had just four hours at the site where this spider was last seen 40 years ago, before our boat came to pick us up.\"I found the first one with just nine minutes to go, and the second one in the last minute. \"I've seen 559 species of spider in the British Isles and this one was by far the most exciting find.\"Mr Telfer said the name was also inspired by the distinctive pale \"knuckles\" on the small leg-like appendages at the side of the spider's mouth.Aulonia albimana was last recorded in the UK in 1985Dr Helen Smith, conservation officer for the British Arachnological Society, said: \"The remarkable discovery of this dapper little spider on the Isle of Wight is one of Britain's epic 'lost species' rediscoveries of the century.\"With repeated failure to find it at its former sites, where its open habitat has been lost, it seemed increasingly likely that it had joined the country's sad list of extinct species.\"The area where the spider was found used to be overgrown but has been restored by the National Trust with the help of a flock of Hebridean sheep. The trust said they chewed through vegetation to maintain short, open turf - creating exactly the kind of patchy, sunlit ground the White-knuckled Wolf Spider favours. Dr Smith praised the \"vital habitat restoration work\" and said it showed the white-knuckled wolf spider \"not only had a place to hang on, but hopefully one in which it can now thrive\".\"We look forward to working with the National Trust to establish the full extent of the population and determine the conditions it needs to expand its range and secure its future\" she said.

    "body": "57 minutes agoJaroslav Lukiv and Hugh Schofield,BBC correspondent in Paris© RMN - Grand Palais (Musée du Louvre) Mathieu RabeauPrecious crown jewels including the Parure Marie-Amélie diadème are yet to be recoveredTwo more people have been charged over a theft at the Louvre Museum last month, the Paris prosecutor's office said.A 38-year-old woman has been charged with complicity in organised theft and criminal conspiracy with a view to committing a crime. Separately, a man, aged 37, was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy. Both denied any involvement.Two men who had previously been arrested were already charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after officials said they had \"partially recognised\" their involvement in the heist.Jewels worth €88m (£76m; $102m) were taken from the world's most-visited museum on 19 October.Four men carried out the lightning-quick daylight theft. Two of the alleged thieves - who had been arrested earlier - later admitted their involvement.The French public is relieved to see quick progress in the investigation - but many see the whole episode as a humiliating embarrassment for the country.Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenOn Saturday, the woman who has been charged was in tears as she appeared before a magistrate and confirmed that she lived in Paris's northern suburb of La Courneuve, a journalist working for the AFP news agency reported.The magistrate later ruled that the woman - who has not been named - must stay in custody.The 37-year-old man - whose identity has also not been revealed - was also ordered to stay in pre-trial detention. He is known to the French justice system for past robberies.In the French judicial system, a suspect \"placed under investigation\" will normally - but not necessarily - end up facing trial.  An examining magistrate is designated to lead the \"investigation\" into the person, looking in theory at material that might exculpate as well as incriminate.In the meantime, the suspect can remain in detention if a judge believes he or she is a potential danger to the public, or might abscond, or might collude with others to arrange evidence.This last argument was used to justify the continued detention of the 38-year-old woman.The alleged role of the second suspect - the 37-year-old man - is not clear. But when the five were detained on Wednesday, the prosecutor's office said that one of them was linked by DNA to the crime scene.  Probably therefore he is suspected of being one of the two men who stayed on the street during the heist.The fourth involved at the scene has not yet been caught.Three other people held earlier this week have been released without charge.Watch: Two people leave Louvre in lift mounted to vehicleOn the day of the heist, the robbers arrived at 09:30 (07:30 GMT), just after the museum opened to visitors, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said last week.The suspects arrived with a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. The men used a disc cutter to crack open display cases housing the jewellery.Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for four minutes and made their escape on two scooters waiting outside at 09:38, before switching to cars.One of the stolen items - a crown - was dropped during the escape. The other seven jewels have not been found.The fear is that they have already been spirited abroad, though the prosecutor in charge of the case has said she is still hopeful they can be retrieved intact. Preliminary results of an enquiry into the robbery were released by Culture Minister Rachida Dati on Friday. She said that for years museum authorities had \"gravely underestimated the risks of intrusion and theft\", promising that new measures would be in place by the end of the year.Shortly after the theft it was revealed by the Louvre's director that the only camera monitoring the Galerie d'Apollon was pointing away from a balcony the thieves climbed over to break in.The president of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, has since admitted the museum had failed in its responsibilities, but denied that security had been overlooked - saying that from the time she took office in 2021 she had been warning constantly of the need for more investment.She also said the main weakness in the security arrangements for the Galerie d'Apollon was the lack of security cameras on the perimeter of the Louvre. But this, she said, was the responsibility of the city of Paris - not the Louvre itself.However, critics have accused des Cars of being too interested in her ambitious renovation plan for the museum - dubbed the New Renaissance - which will see a new entrance as well as a separate gallery for the Mona Lisa. They say money that should have gone for basic protection of the site has been kept in the bank to finance the new project.Since the incident, security measures have been tightened around France's cultural institutions.The Louvre has transferred some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France following the heist.

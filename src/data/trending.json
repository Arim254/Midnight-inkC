    "body": "Image source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Dave Reddin, Jac Morgan, Steve Tandy and Richard Collier-Keywood lead the bid to improve Welsh rugby fortunesByGareth GriffithsBBC Sport WalesAutumn Nations Series: Wales v Argentina Venue: Principality Stadium, Cardiff Date: Sunday, 9 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMTCoverage: Commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio Wales, BBC Radio Cymru and live text on BBC Sport online.The Steve Tandy era starts today in Cardiff against Argentina with Welsh rugby hoping for an urgent reset.The Welsh game is in disarray and needs some sort of feelgood factor.Off the field, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) needs to demonstrate to supporters they can run the game effectively after recent controversies has resulted in public distrust towards the governing body.    On the field, the Welsh public want to see a men's national side restore an identity and eventually return to winning ways, after a recently-ended record 18-match losing run which has seen them slip to 12th in the world.Welsh fans will hope the arrival of new head coach Tandy can help inspire the start of that process.New man aims to put Wales back on world mapMedia caption, Steve Tandy on his rise from Tonmawr village to Wales head coachAfter ending the horrid run of defeats with victory against Japan in Kobe in their second summer Test, Wales now usher in a new era with Tandy the first Welshman to become the permanent coach of the national team since Gareth Jenkins left office in 2007. Be tough, brave and smart. That has been the fresh motto with buzz words including 'identity' and 'connections'.Tandy was a no-nonsense flanker during his playing days and the former Scotland and British and Irish Lions defence coach has made a positive impression in his first few weeks in charge. The 45-year-old has brought a fresh outlook to how Wales operate and hopes to translate that to the pitch by reawakening a once proud rugby nation.But he can not be expected to work miracles. Any improvement will be gradual and Tandy deserves time to try and turn Welsh rugby's flagging fortunes around.Tandy is inheriting a squad not used to success with the Welsh regions, and has named 11 players based in England and France in his first matchday 23. One of those is returning Saracens prop Rhys Carre, who makes his first appearance since 2023 after falling out of favour with previous Wales coach Warren Gatland and  his perceived unavailability under the WRU's 25-cap selection policy.With a loophole in the rules discovered, Carre returns to start, while the biggest cheer of the day might be reserved for when Bristol wing Louis Rees-Zammit enters the field from the replacements bench.Rees-Zammit is back after an 18-month spell in the NFL at the Kansas City Chiefs and the Jacksonville Jaguars and has been grabbing the headlines again. Wales desperately need a good news story and positive press. Maybe the man known as \"LRZ\" could provide that.Welsh rugby crisis as teams threatened with cullMedia caption, Wales rugby: Collier-Keywood and Reddin defend roles amid revampAnother season has presented another crisis in Welsh rugby. Two-and-a-half years on from Wales players stepping back from taking strike action before a Six Nations fixture against England, the domestic game is in turmoil again with the WRU proposing plans to cut one of the nation's four regions.The governing body announced the policy of cutting one of the four professional sides a couple of days before the squad assembled under Tandy for the first time.In April the governing body were still suggesting they could fund four professional sides equally. By August, the preference had dropped to two sides and two months later, three is now the optimal number. How they get there or by what date remains unclear, meaning there remains major uncertainty for players.The WRU has confirmed it plans to grant three licences for men's clubs - one for Cardiff, one in the east and one in the west. That means Ospreys and Scarlets could be set to do battle for WRU funding and the licence in the west.This leaves some Welsh players preparing for autumn internationals wondering whether they will have a club next season or where they might be playing. The players and coaches are trying to talk publicly about controlling what happens on the field, attempting to solely concentrate on rugby matters.We wait to see whether the issues have a negative effect but it will take strong characters to put such matters to the back of their minds.Will fans vote with their feet?Media caption, Wales need to be 'smart and brave' against ArgentinaWales are hoping to turn the Principality Stadium back into a home fortress, having not won an international in Cardiff for 27 months.Since beating England in a World Cup warm-up match in August 2023, Wales have suffered nine straight home Test defeats, a losing record which has stretched back 827 days.The most recent Wales game in Cardiff was eight months ago - the horrific 68-14 home Six Nations defeat inflicted by England. That was a record loss for the hosts in the Welsh capital, the most points they have conceded at the Principality Stadium, their heaviest Six Nations defeat, a record loss in the tournament and most points conceded against England.So Wales have to make amends in a ground that is no longer a fortress. Tandy's side face Argentina, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa in November, before home 2026 Six Nations matches against France, Scotland and Italy, in a tournament where Wales last won a home match in February 2022.How many fans will turn up to watch Tandy's side this month remains to be seen with the current discontent surrounding the Welsh game.The Principality Stadium's capacity is 74,500, meaning the four matches could attract a maximum of 298,000 supporters in November.Wales' clash against the All Blacks is currently the only game close to being a sellout.There have been numerous anecdotal stories about some tickets now being available at a discounted rate and even being given away for free. It is the WRU's responsibility to try and attract back the fans who have drifted away disillusioned with what they have witnessed on the field and read about off it.World Cup permutationsImage source, Huw Evans Picture AgencyImage caption, Wales held an open training session at the Principality Stadium in front of more than 6,000 supporters There is something tangible at stake this November. Wales will be among teams looking to pick up crucial ranking points before the draw for the 2027 Rugby World Cup on 3 December.Sides will be drawn into six pools of four for the group stage of the tournament in Australia.The top six sides in the world rankings will be placed in band one for the draw and would therefore avoid playing each other in the pool stage, while the next six sides will form the second band.Wales are currently 12th and will want to stay in the top dozen to avoid falling out of the second group of teams and therfore facing an even trickier World Cup draw.Victory against Japan in the second autumn fixture is essential to achieve this in a crucial game with regards to World Cup seedings.The Brave Blossoms won the first summer Test between the two sides before Wales took the second and sit directly below Tandy's side in the world rankings.Tough times aheadBefore that Japan date, Argentina arrive in Cardiff today as firm favourites. Los Pumas are sixth in the world rankings and fresh from some outstanding results in the Rugby Championship where Felipe Contepomi's side recorded historic victories against Australia and New Zealand.The battle-hardened matchday squad have 944 caps between them, more than 400 more than Wales possess.Wales will also face the best two sides in the world to conclude the campaign with New Zealand and world champions South Africa arriving in Cardiff on successive weekends.The final game against the Springboks is outside World Rugby's international window which means Wales will be without their players based in England and France.  It also clashes with a United Rugby Championship (URC) league weekend where the four Welsh professional sides will be without their internationals.So the next few weeks will provide more testing times on and off the pitch as the battle to win hearts and minds intensifies.Tandy's team will search for some success and the WRU aim to somehow map out Welsh rugby's future.Welsh fans just need something to hold onto - that things can and will be different in the future after the exhausting soap opera of the past few years. They will hope that process starts today.",

Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "11 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterLisa Nandy: 'We didn't meet the highest standards - that is on me'The culture secretary has apologised for breaking rules by failing to declare she had received donations from the man she picked to run England's new football regulator.On Thursday, the commissioner for public appointments published a report which found that David Kogan had made two separate donations of £1,450 to Lisa Nandy, when she was running to be Labour leader in 2020. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Nandy said: \"We didn't meet the highest standards - that is on me.\"The Conservatives have said Nandy's actions were \"a serious breach of public trust\" and called for a further investigation into Sir Keir Starmer, who also received donations from Mr Kogan. In a statement, Mr Kogan has said: \"As the commissioner states, my suitability for the role has never been in question, and at no point was I aware of any deviation from best practice.\"Mr Kogan, a sports rights executive, was initially longlisted for the football regulator role under the previous Conservative government.Nandy became involved in the process after Labour won the 2024 general election and she took on the role of culture secretary.In April, she announced that Mr Kogan would be her preferred pick to fill the £130,000-a-year role.However, a month later she removed herself from the appointment process after Mr Kogan revealed to a parliamentary committee that he had donated \"very small sums\" to Nandy in 2020. In his report, commissioner for public appointments Sir William Shawcross said Nandy had \"unknowingly\" breached the code and should have checked if Mr Kogan had given her money before choosing him as her preferred candidate.The contributions were part of total donations worth £33,410 to Labour and the party's candidates in the five years prior to his appointment, the commissioner said.Mr Kogan's donations to Nandy were below declaration thresholds set by the Electoral Commission and by Parliament.Asked why she had not declared the donation during the appointments process, Lisa Nandy told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg she had not known about the money at the time it was given. She said that during her leadership campaign she had been \"out on the road\" doing hustings and interviews.\"I wasn't involved in fundraising for the campaign, and as soon as I found out I declared it and recused myself and I complied fully with the process.\"She insisted Labour was different from the Conservatives saying: \"When we make mistakes – and we will make mistakes, we are human beings-  we put ourselves through independent processes, we respect the outcome and we take the consequences.\"In his report, Sir William said: \"It need not be true that the donations actually influenced the secretary of state's decision-making – only that the risk of this perception should have been mitigated by declaration of this financial interest.\"He found the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had breached the rules by failing to declare Mr Kogan's previous donations to Labour when he was named as the government's preferred choice for the job.The department also breached the rules by not discussing the donations to Nandy when Mr Kogan was interviewed for the job, Sir William found.After the report was published, Nandy wrote a letter to the prime minister saying: \"I deeply regret this error. I appreciate the perception it could create.\"In his reply, Sir Keir Starmer wrote: \"I know you to be a person of integrity and on the basis of your letter, it is clear you have acted in good faith.\"In May 2024, Mr Kogan donated £2,500 to the prime minister's local Labour branch of Holborn and St Pancras.The Conservatives have asked the government's ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus to investigate whether Sir Keir's role in Mr Kogan's appointment broke ministerial rules on transparency. Downing Street said Sir William Shawcross had already carried out an extensive review and \"found no breaches aside from those set out in the report\".The football regulator role was set up following a fan-led review into the management of football clubs. The regulator has been tasked with improving the financial sustainability of clubs and safeguarding \"the heritage of English football\". ",

    "body": "14 hours agoCBSMaria Florinda Rios Perez was fatally shot after arriving at the wrong home for a house-cleaning appointment US officials are looking into whether to file charges against an Indiana homeowner who shot and killed a house cleaner who mistakenly showed up at the wrong address.Police say they found Maria Florinda Rios Perez dead in her husband's arms on the front porch of a home on Wednesday shortly before 0700 local time (12:00 GMT). Authorities had been responding to a call about a possible home invasion in the Indianapolis suburb of Whitestown. The two did not appear to have entered the home, police said in a statement. They have formally submitted the case to the Boone County Prosecutor's Office for review to determine whether criminal charges will be brought in the case. Police have not identified the people in the home or who fired the shot, saying in a statement on Friday that it is a \"complex, delicate, and evolving case, and it would be both inappropriate and potentially dangerous to disclose that information\". They urged patience, warning of a \"concerning spread of misinformation online\" about the case.Mauricio Velazquez, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that he wanted justice for his 32-year-old wife. News reports say that she was a mother of four and originally from Guatemala. In an interview with CBS affiliate WTTV, Mr Velazquez said the bullet came right through the door of the home. \"They should've called the police first instead of just shooting out of nowhere like that,\" he said through an interpreter.CBSMauricio Velazquez said the bullet that killed his wife came through the door of the home they went to early on WednesdayBoone County prosecutor Kent Eastwood told The Indianapolis Star that the case is complex due to the language of the state's stand-your-ground law.Stand-your-ground laws are in place in many US states and most permit an individual to protect themselves with the use of reasonable force, including deadly force, to prevent death or great bodily harm.Similar incidents have made headlines across the US in recent years. In 2023, Ralph Yarl, who was then 16, was shot twice after ringing the doorbell of the wrong home in Missouri. Andrew Lester, who was in his 80s, pleaded guilty and died while awaiting sentencing. In New York, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis died after being shot upon entering the wrong driveway. The homeowner who shot her is now serving a 25-year sentence. ",

    "body": "HMRC to review suspending 23,500 child benefit payments43 minutes agoEimear DevlinBBC Money Box reporterEve CravenEve Craven had her child benefit halted after she went on a five-day trip to New York with her sonThe UK's tax body is reviewing its decisions to strip child benefit from about 23,500 claimants after it used travel data to conclude they had left the country permanently.Normally the benefit runs out after eight weeks living outside the UK, but many people affected complained that HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) had stopped their money after they went on holiday for just a short time.The move came after MPs on the Treasury Select Committee demanded answers from the tax authority.HMRC has apologised for any errors and says anyone who thinks their benefits have been stopped incorrectly should contact them.In September, the government began a crackdown on child benefit fraud which it believes could save £350m over five years.The new system allows HMRC records to be compared with Home Office international travel data, and the tax authority had used this data to stop payments to thousands of families.But it is now reviewing all of the cases following a growing number of complaints from people affected who said they had been on holiday, and had returned to the UK after a short time.Eve Craven went on a five-day break with her son to New York. She told the BBC's Money Box programme that about 18 months after the trip she received a letter saying the child benefit for her son had been stopped.The letter cited her trip to the US, saying it had no record of her return.\"It gave me a month basically to give them all the requested information to prove that I'd come back to the UK,\" she said.\"It's just a very big ask for something that they've messed up on, and they should have been able to sort out themselves.\"Eve's child benefit has now been reinstated with missing payments backdated.The issue was first identified in Northern Ireland, where some families had flown out of the UK from Belfast, but then returned to Dublin – which is in the EU - before driving home over the border.UK and Irish citizens can travel freely into each other's countries under the Common Travel Area arrangement.There are no routine passport checks when travelling through the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, meaning the UK government has no data to show that someone may have returned to Northern Ireland.It is not clear how many errors have been made in total, or how.HMRC told Money Box it would be reviewing all past cases \"using PAYE data and where continued UK employment is found, will be reinstating payments and making any back payments necessary\".It is aiming to complete its review by the end of next week.MPs on the Treasury Select Committee are also now investigating.Additional reporting by Nick Edser",

    "body": "60 minutes agoKathryn Armstrong and André Rhoden-Paul and Lulu Luo,Aurora, Philippines The BBC's Jonathan Head says the Philippines is braced for an \"absolutely massive storm\"More than 900,000 people have been evacuated as the Philippines braces for Typhoon Fung-wong to make landfall. The storm, which is expected to make landfall on Sunday evening, was upgraded to super typhoon with sustained winds around 185 km/h (115mph) and gusts of 230km/h (143mph). The country's meteorological service has warned there is a \"high-risk of life-threatening and damaging storm surge with peak heights exceeding 3m [10ft]\" as the storm moves in a north-westerly across towards Luzon - the Philippine's most populous island. Fung-wong - known locally as Uwan - comes days after an earlier storm, Kalmaegi, left a trail of destruction and nearly 200 people dead.The eastern Bicol region was the first part of the Philippines to be directly hit by the storm on Sunday morning, before making its way past the Polillo Islands on Sunday afternoon. Several schools have either cancelled classes on Monday or moved them online, while nearly 300 flights have been cancelled. Fung-wong is expected to weaken after making landfall somewhere between the districts of Baler and Casiguran, but it is likely to remain a typhoon as it travels over Luzon.Over 200mm of rain is forecast for parts of Luzon, even 100-200mm in the Metro Manilla area. This is expected to cause severe flooding and landslides.  Eastern parts of the Philippines have already begun experiencing heavy rains and winds, a weather official said on Saturday evening.While much of the country is expected to be affected, there are particular concerns about those areas that could take a direct hit, including Catanduanes, an island in the east of the Bicol region, where extreme conditions were reported on Sunday morning.Residents there, as well as in other low-lying and coastal areas, had been urged to move to higher ground by Sunday morning.In the Aurora region, in eastern Luzon, BBC News spoke to Hagunoy, 21, who works at one of the dozen hotels which line the coast in Sabang.He said police had repeatedly visited in recent days to ensure all guests were evacuated ahead of the storm. The hotels were all deserted on Sunday morning.While the tide had risen sharply, Hagunoy said he would stay as long as he could to guard the property, before riding his motorbike home to safety. Staff had secured the gates and tied windows shut with rope to try to stop the glass from shattering in the wind.EPA/ShutterstockThe Filipino Coast Guard undertook evacuations ahead of the typhoon in Quezon provinceHow do hurricanes or typhoons form and are they getting stronger?In central Aurora more than 200 people arrived at a shelter in a sports centre. Many parents have brought young children, too young to remember Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people when it struck the Phillipines in 2013. Fung-wong has also forced the suspension of rescue operations following the passage of Kalmaegi, one of the strongest typhoons this year.Heavy rainfall sent torrents of mud down hillsides and into residential areas. Some poorer neighbourhoods were obliterated by the fast-moving flash floods.At least 204 people are now known to have died in the Philippines as a result of the earlier storm, while more than 100 are still missing. Five people also died in Vietnam, where strong winds uprooted trees, tore off roofs, and smashed large windows.Families gathered at this shelter in a sports centre in central Aurora in eastern LuzonThe Filipino government declared a state of calamity across the country after Typhoon Kalmaegi and in preparation for the coming storm.It has given government agencies more power to access emergency funds and fast-track deliveries of essential goods and services.For some Filipinos, the devastation wrought by Kalmaegi has left them even more anxious about the storm to come.\"We decided to evacuate because the recent typhoon brought floods in our area, and now I just want to keep my family safe,\" Norlito Dugan told the AFP news agency.He is among those who have taken shelter in a church in the city of Sorsogon in Luzon.Another resident, Maxine Dugan said: \"I'm here because the waves near my house are now huge.\"The Philippines - located near the area where Pacific Ocean tropical weather systems form - is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to cyclones.About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which affect the country directly.Climate change is not thought to increase the number of hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones worldwide.However, warmer oceans coupled with a warmer atmosphere - fuelled by climate change - have the potential to make those that do form even more intense. That can potentially lead to higher wind speeds, heavier rainfall, and a greater risk of coastal flooding.",

    "body": "Former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson dies aged 6815 hours agoAlex Kleiderman and Theo Leggett,correspondentBBCWillson was on Top Gear between 1991 and 2001Jeremy Clarkson and James May have led tributes to fellow Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson, who died on Saturday aged 68.Willson was a co-host on the BBC motoring programme between 1991 and 2001 - presenting alongside the two before Clarkson's revamp of the show - and went on to present Fifth Gear on Channel 5.May, who briefly appeared with Willson on the original Top Gear in the 1990s, called him a \"great bloke\", while Clarkson described him as a \"properly funny man\".The Leicester-born father-of-three - who later worked as a campaigner and electric vehicle (EV) advocate - died after a short battle with lung cancer, his family said in a statement.They described him as a \"national treasure\" and \"true consumer champion\", adding: \"Quentin brought the joy of motoring, from combustion to electric, into our living rooms.\"They went on to say: \"The void he has left can never be filled. His knowledge was not just learned but lived; a library of experience now beyond our reach.\"May, who went on to become part of the revived Top Gear presenting team, wrote on X that Willson \"gave me proper advice and encouragement during my earliest attempts at TV, back in the late 90s\", adding: \"I've never forgotten it.\"Clarkson recalled: \"We had some laughs over the years.\"Willson was Top Gear's used car expert, known for his wry delivery and scathing reviews.In one review from 1998, he described Jaguars as being \"the domain of spivs, crooks and bookmakers\" three decades prior.He also presented The Car's the Star for the BBC and The Classic Car Show on Channel 5, and worked as a motoring journalist for Classic Cars magazine and the Mirror. He was named motoring writer of the year at the British Press Awards in 2004.Willson would later work as a campaigner, fronting the FairFuel group calling for lower fuel duties, and became an early advocate of electric vehicles (EVs).Presenter Vicki Butler-Henderson, who worked alongside Willson on both Top Gear and Fifth Gear, said he was \"very much the champion of the consumer and educated people throughout many car deals, saving people hundreds - if not thousands - of pounds\".She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he had \"made a huge difference\" with his campaigning on fuel duties and \"definitely helped keep money in our pockets for well over a decade\".Tiff Needell, who appeared on Top Gear alongside Willson, wrote on X: \"Oh Quentin how can you leave us so soon. So many memories...\"Willson was partnered with Hazel Newberry on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004Willson was also an early proponent of EVs, lobbying for better infrastructure and lower charging costs through his FairCharge campaign.The family statement highlighted his championing of General Motors' EV1 electric car in the 1990s, saying it proved he was \"always ahead of the curve\".\"More recently he had worked tirelessly to make EVs affordable for all,\" they added.\"Quentin will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him personally and professionally.\"AA president Edmund King said he was \"devastated\" by Willson's death, calling him a \"brilliant TV presenter\" and an \"amazing campaigner\".\"He will be missed by all.\"Willson was a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004, where his eight-point total for one routine still stands as the lowest score given by judges on the show.He told the Independent three years later that he was \"very proud\" to have recorded the score. \"Builders ran up to me to shake my hand because I failed so badly. I tried, but I was the dancing equivalent of a JCB,\" the presenter said of his Cha Cha Cha.Willson is survived by his wife, Michaela, his three children and three grandchildren.",

    "body": "37 minutes agoAmy WalkerSir Richard Knighton: \"We don't yet know... the source of those drones\"UK military personnel and equipment are being sent to Belgium to help it bolster its defences after drone incursions on its airspace, suspected of being carried out by Russia.The new head of the UK military, Sir Richard Knighton, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that his Belgian counterpart asked for assistance earlier this week and that kit and personnel were on the way.Belgium's main airport Zavantem was forced to close temporarily on Thursday night after drones were spotted nearby. They were also spotted in other locations, including a military base.Sir Richard said it was not known if the incursions were by Russia, but added it was \"plausible\" they had been ordered by Moscow.In a statement, Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"As hybrid threats grow, our strength lies in our alliances and our collective resolve to defend, deter and protect our critical infrastructure and airspace\".Alongside Nato allies, he added that the UK would help Belgium \"by providing our kit and capability\" which he said was already being deployed. On Friday the German defence ministry said it would support Belgium with anti-drone measures after a request from Brussels.About 3,000 Brussels Airlines passengers were affected by the disruption, and the carrier said it faced \"considerable costs\" from cancelling or diverting dozens of flights.German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and the Belgian security services have said they suspect Russia, but Belgian Defence Minister Theo Francken has previously admitted there is no accompanying evidence.\"At first, drones flying over our military bases were seen as our problem,\" Francken said earlier this week.\"Now it has become a serious threat affecting civilian infrastructure across multiple European countries.\"Getty ImagesDrone incursions over Western Europe could have been sent by the Kremlin, Sir Richard saidMore broadly, Sir Richard said Russia was \"the most pressing threat right now\" to Europe. \"The illegal invasion of Ukraine has shown the barbaric nature of Russia's war efforts,\" he told the programme.He added that sabotage and killings had been carried out by Russia on UK soil, and that so-called hybrid warfare is where \"we [The UK] need to strengthen ourselves\".The shadow defence secretary welcomed the move, saying there was \"a heightened threat environment\" and a key part of deterring threats was \"by acting with other countries through Nato\". But James Cartlidge also criticised the government's approach to increasing defence spending, saying more urgency was needed.In spring, the government announced defence spending would rise to 2.5% of GDP from April 2027, with an ambition to reach 3% in the next parliament. Sir Richard said the funding was \"more than I've ever known in my career\".In recent months, a number of drone sightings have caused major flight disruptions across Europe, including in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.Despite some officials blaming \"hybrid warfare\" by Russia, the Kremlin has denied any involvement.Pistorious has suggested the latest sightings could be linked to European Union discussions to use frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine in the form of a €140bn loan.While there is no public proof of Russia's involvement, suspicions have been fuelled by more serious airspace incursions by Russia in Eastern Europe over recent months, involving fighter jets and larger attack drones.The UK has recently sent RAF Typhoon jets to take part in defence missions over Poland as part of Nato's mission to bolster the eastern flank in response to incursions.",

    "body": "12 hours agoJonathan BealeDefence correspondentBen SoppitBen Soppitt has been raising awareness about the conditions of Iraq's war cemeteriesThis Remembrance Sunday, Ben Soppitt will be honouring the sacrifice of his grandfather at Basra War Cemetery in Iraq. He'll be among the very few, honouring many.His small service will be in stark contrast to the large, solemn ceremony at the Cenotaph in London. Nor do the monuments in Iraq bear any resemblance to the carefully maintained war memorials and manicured cemeteries all across Europe.Ben Soppitt says the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) has \"catastrophically failed\" in its duty to honour the dead in Iraq. He says it \"shames the men and women who gave their lives in Iraq\".More than 50,000 soldiers from the UK and Commonwealth nations lost their lives in Iraq in both World Wars. Most were casualties of the Mesopotamian Campaign during World War One, when British and Commonwealth troops fought the Ottoman empire. And most of those killed were Indian nationals.Ben Soppitt's grandfather, Gunner Joseph Soppitt, is among those buried at Basra War Cemetery. He died in 1941 of dysentery when British forces briefly fought there during World War Two. His grave – like the rest of the nearly 3,000 men buried there – has no official marking. Others buried there include a recipient of the Victoria Cross, George Wheeler, and the grandfather of the actress Charlotte Rampling – Sapper Harris Johnson Rampling.Ben SoppittBen Soppitt's grandfather, Gunner Joseph Soppitt, is among those buried at Basra War CemeteryThe Commonwealth War Grave Commission cleared the site of all headstones after many had been vandalised or fallen into disrepair. There is a long-term plan to replace them, but the CWGC withdrew from Iraq in the 1990s for security reasons. Since then, Basra War Cemetery has become a deserted wasteland, used by the locals for football or to dispose of rubbish. Basra is not alone. There are more than a dozen such sites across the country.Some sites have weathered the heat and dust of Iraq better than others. The giant Basra War Memorial nearby, the third largest in the world, is still largely intact. It commemorates more than 40,000 soldiers. 7,385 are individually named on panels – all the British personnel and Indian officers. But 3,256 Indian nationals who served in the ranks are only listed by unit and number.Ben SoppittBasra War Cemetery has become a deserted wasteland with children playing footballCWGC has promised to address this \"inequality in commemoration\", which has favoured British nationals. Ben Soppit says \"this historical wrong cannot be completed without addressing the Indian casualties in Iraq\". He argues that its another compelling reason why it should resume its work there.Over the past two weeks, Ben Soppitt has been visiting most of the CWGC sites in Iraq to honour the dead - but also to highlight what he believes is Britain's failure to do the same. He's been documenting what he's seen on social media.He found the CWGC site in Mosul to be in a similar state to the one in Basra.\"Nothing is left but the pedestals of the memorials and a few of the stones from them,\" he wrote online. \"If my opinion of the CWGC was low before it's reached a new depth\".Ben SoppittOver the past two weeks, Ben Soppitt has been visiting most of the CWGC sites in IraqThe Commonwealth War Grave Commission says it has detailed plans in place to restore its sites in Iraq. It says it has already carried out some renovation work but adds that \"determining the right time to undertake full restoration is a complex judgement\". One of the key determinations, it says, is safety and security in the region. It follows UK foreign office advice for Iraq which currently advises against travel to the country. It says that it keeps the public informed of its work on its website.But there is clearly frustration at the pace of progress. Baroness Emma Nicholson too highlighted the state of the CWGC sites at Basra during one of her visits in 2007. She says she understands that as a government body the CWGC must heed the Foreign Office's travel advice. But she adds they \"must do more\".For Ben Soppitt and his family, the campaign for the CWGC to do more is deeply personal. He had hoped to visit the site of his grandfather's grave in Basra with his own father. But he's now passed away.\"I don't intend to pass this on to my own sons,\" Ben says. \"So I'm doing everything I can to have these men and women properly commemorated before I pass on too.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoBen Wright,BBC Political Correspondent and Tabby WilsonAn independent review into the rising number of young people not working or studying is being launched by the government.Former Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn will lead the inquiry into \"Neets\" - the acronym for young people who are not in education, employment or training.According to Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden, the persistently high number of 16-24 year olds falling out of education or work is a \"crisis of opportunity\" requiring urgent action. It is not a new problem but the number of young people who are Neet - now one in eight - has been rising in recent years and is approaching one million.A quarter cite long-term sickness or disability as a barrier and the number claiming health and disability benefits is rising too. The government says Alan Milburn's review will dig into the reasons behind the rise and examine ways of cutting the long-term costs of youth inactivity and getting young people off benefits and into work.Its conclusions will be published next summer. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has called the broader benefits system unsustainable and unfair but so far selling welfare reform to Labour backbenchers has proved a political minefield for Number 10.According to the Department of Work and Pensions, the number of young people claiming UC Health and Employment Support Allowance has risen by more than 50% over the past five years. Some 80% of young people on the UC Health element currently cite mental health reasons or a neurodevelopmental condition.Asked whether he thought over-diagnosis was fuelling a mental health crisis among young people, McFadden was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: \"I don't want to play amateur doctor. I want to approach this with sensitivity.\"The question I'm asking is, given the higher reported number of these conditions among young people, what is the best policy response? I don't believe there should be an automatic link between diagnosis and benefits.\"\"If we get this right,\" he added, \"the prize is huge: transforming lives and life chances, with the pent-up potential of the next generation firing our economy and building a better future for all.\"We cannot afford to lose a generation of young people to a life on benefits, with no work prospects and not enough hope.\"Milburn said his review would be \"uncompromising\", and expose any failings in employment support, education, skills, health and welfare.\"We cannot stand by and let a generation of young people be consigned to a life without employment or prospects,\" he said. \"It's clear urgent action is needed.\"",

    "body": "You can tell how Aryna Sabalenka is feeling with just one glance.A missed shot is greeted by gritted teeth, an eye-roll, a choice word towards her coaching team. Winners and aces bring a huge roar to the heavens, clenched fist raised high.Her emotions fuel her - but they can also hinder her. Nowhere was that more obvious than the French Open final. Seventy unforced errors flew from Sabalenka's racquet as she was outsmarted by Coco Gauff on a windy Paris evening.She broke down afterwards, apologising for \"the worst final I ever played\". She went further in a news conference, saying Gauff won \"not because she played incredible [but] because I made all of those mistakes\".Sabalenka was heavily criticised for the comments. She apologised to Gauff, but some questioned if her emotions, such a crucial part of her game, would prevent her from winning another Slam.\"Women get criticised a lot for emotion,\" the great Billie Jean King told BBC Sport at Wimbledon.\"Girls are taught to be perfect and boys are taught to be brave. But nobody's brave all the time, and nobody's perfect.\"The best players, everybody always talks about 'they're mentally stronger' - no, they're emotionally stronger.\"When you're on the court, you have to feel you deserve it.\"Sablenka ended the year a Grand Slam champion, having defended her US Open title, and kept the top ranking for 55 weeks in a row.But the 27-year-old will also be left reflecting on another near-miss after losing the season-ending WTA Finals title match to Elena Rybakina, where she admitted she had \"overthought\" her game.Sabalenka is one of the most powerful hitters in the women's game, but that was her undoing in her first few seasons on the tour.She initially struggled at the majors, suffering a string of early exits before reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2021.Slam success seemed assured - but her serve, and her sheer desperation to win, got in the way.In a match in Adelaide in early 2022, Sabalenka hit 21 double faults. At one point, she resorted to underarm serves. It was so bad that the umpire asked Sabalenka if she was OK, thinking she was injured.After serving out the next game to love - and hitting an ace on the final point - Sabalenka hunched over next to her coach, hid her face in a towel, and cried.She ended 2022 with 428 double faults - 151 more than anyone else on the WTA Tour - and no titles.There was also the emotional stress Sabalenka had experienced. Her father, Sergey, died in 2019, and she was desperate to fulfil their shared dream of a major singles title.\"I really wanted to win a Slam for him, to put our family name into history,\" Sabalenka said in 2022.\"When he passed away, I started thinking too much about it. Now there is zero in my pocket. I just put so much pressure on myself.\"Sabalenka previously worked with a psychologist but stopped during the 2023 pre-season, saying she realised \"nobody other than me would help me\".She began the year with a tweaked serve and her first title for 18 months. Four weeks later, she was at long last a Grand Slam singles champion. Her new serve, and sheer determination, led her to the Australian Open title.Three more Grand Slams came over the next two years and Sabalenka seemed to find a healthy balance with her emotions. She faltered in the 2023 US Open final, overwhelmed by the 24,000-strong pro-Gauff crowd, and obliterated her racquet backstage afterwards. But four months later she defended her Melbourne title in serene fashion, losing just 31 games overall.Afterwards, she said a conversation with her mother had brought a form of \"relief\".\"When I told her I want to win a Slam for my dad, she said 'what are you talking about? He was proud of you after each match you won. Every match for him mattered and titles weren't a big deal for him',\" she said.\"I felt free.\"Sabalenka started this year bidding to become the first woman since 1999 to win three successive Australian Open titles, but lost to a brilliant Madison Keys. She then let her emotions run riot on and off court in her Roland Garros loss to Gauff.\"You lose the final of the biggest tournament and you don't think cleanly,\" she said. \"I had to sit back and reflect on everything, and make sure that people understand my point - that I was completely wrong.\"It was a tough lesson but it helped me in so many different ways.\"Sabalenka battled her emotions at Wimbledon, most impressively against home favourite Emma Raducanu in the third round. \"Maybe earlier in my career, I would just go crazy and lose that set,\" she said afterwards.\"I was like, 'do not waste your energy - keep everything you have left inside'.\"After a semi-final loss where Sabalenka felt she was not as \"brave\" as opponent Amanda Anisimova, she opted for a holiday. There, Sabalenka thought about why she let her emotions \"take control over me in those two finals\".She made a decision - during her US Open title defence, she, not her emotions, would decide her fate.Sabalenka made her way through the draw and found herself facing Anisimova in the final, with the American aiming to overcome a brutal Wimbledon final loss. Given the pressure Sabalenka already felt to ensure she didn't finish the year without a Slam, it was a huge test of her mental strength.It was, arguably, Sabalenka's most mature performance of the season. Even a missed overhead as she served for the title was greeted with a wry smile. Sabalenka was broken in that game but put together a dominant tie-break to triumph.\"I knew that [because of] the hard work we put in, I deserved to have a Grand Slam title this season,\" Sabalenka added.\"Getting this trophy means I learned a lesson. I became a better player, I have better control over my emotions, and I am super happy.\"There is still work to do, as missing out on the WTA Finals title shows. But Sabalenka was able to shrug the loss off quickly - a positive sign for her after a tricky year.\"After a little time, I feel actually great. The bad thing this season [is] I lost most of the biggest finals I made,\" she added.\"So I guess I'll just sit back in the Maldives having my tequila and think that actually, it's been pretty good so far. \"I just need to get little bit better with myself and hopefully next season I'll improve.\"",

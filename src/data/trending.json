    "body": "55 minutes agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe last 12 months have delivered a huge number of viral moments - Taylor Swift getting engaged, a raccoon getting drunk, and the 6-7 trend driving teachers everywhere to early retirement.But those weren't the only moments that kept us entertained throughout the year. Here are 15 of the cultural highlights (and lowlights) that defined 2025.1. Beyoncé's Grammy reactionCBS\"Wait, what? Me? I've won? I've won a Grammy? I've won this Grammy? Are you sure?\"Beyoncé didn't actually say any of these words as she won country album of the year in February, but her facial expression and body language conveyed her understandable shock.There had been some well-documented snobbery towards Cowboy Carter within the country community, but it had a huge night, also winning Beyoncé album of the year for the first time.We'll skip over the fact that she should've won much sooner for Lemonade or Renaissance and just be grateful that Beyoncé got her trophy and the internet got a meme for the ages.2. Sydney Sweeney's denim dramaGetty Images\"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" So said the strap line for an American Eagle advert in July that featured the Euphoria actress dressed head to toe in denim.Depending on your viewpoint, this was either a fun piece of wordplay in a harmless clothing advert, or a dog whistle for white supremacy and eugenics-era rhetoric.The publicity generated by the fallout duly prompted the company's sales to skyrocket. Sadly for Sweeney, it didn't result in a similar surge for her next film at the box office.The actress herself kept quiet throughout the controversy, but later clarified she \"does not support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign\", adding: \"I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand.\" 3. Lily Allen's revenge Getty Images/Nieves GonzálezIt was an eventful year in music - Oasis got through their reunion shows seemingly without incident, the launch of a new Elvis experience was a blue suede shambles, and Coldplay's tour left two fans in Massachusetts wishing they'd stayed home.Meanwhile, there was an epidemic of plummeting pop stars. A giant car Beyoncé was floating in at her concerts tilted too far, almost tipping her into the audience, while a giant mid-air butterfly Katy Perry was sitting on plunged several feet.But it was Lily Allen's West End Girl that became the most talked about album of the year, thanks to its detailed description of the events that led to her divorce from Stranger Things actor David Harbour.Sample lyric, about setting the terms of an open relationship: \"We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don't be shameless / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers.\"4. Adolescence: A one-shot wonderNetflix/GettyNetflix's series about a schoolboy accused of stabbing a female classmate was one of the biggest TV hits of the year, dominating conversation for weeks. \"Did you know it was all shot in one take?\" said everybody you know. Gosh, was it really? You're the first person to mention that.\"Can you believe this was Owen Cooper's first screen acting role?\" Well, yes actually.   At 15 years old I wasn't expecting a jam-packed IMDb profile.A few months later, the teenager became the youngest male winner of an Emmy Award, and gave an inspirational acceptance speech.\"I was nothing three years ago, I'm here now,\" said Cooper, who was 12 three years ago. \"If you listen, focus and step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life.\"5. Dubai chocolate floods the shelvesGetty ImagesThere have been plenty of food and drink crazes over the years - matcha, bubble tea, cronuts, and the Starbucks olive oil coffee that we're still disappointed didn't really catch on. This year, the pistachio finally got its moment in the spotlight, after a woman with a very specific pregnancy craving turned it into a phenomenon.The decadent chocolate bar and its creamy pistachio filling subsequently went viral on TikTok thanks to its photogenic look and velvety taste, leading to a string of imitators (charging £11 per bar) and a global surge in pistachio demand.6. The endlessly parodied Jet2 advertGetty ImagesDespite being released in 2015, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand was named TikTok song of the year after a viral trendOne of the most enjoyable trends of the summer, before it inevitably became overdone, was the much-parodied Jet2 advert.You know the one, where the inescapable Jess Glynne song Hold My Hand plays over footage of a family enjoying their holiday, in an ad campaign that has been running since around 1874. Social media users began sending it up by using the music and slogan over scenes of travel chaos instead, such as tourists in hotels binge-drinking, getting sunburn and physically fighting over sun loungers.Other TikTokkers took to the streets to test members of the public on the ad's famous strap line. The trend led to Hold My Hand being named TikTok's song of the year, despite being released in 2015.7. EsDeeKid's video with Timothée ChalametChalamet/EsDeeKid/XAs Banksy will tell you, nothing gets the public (and press) more interested in your work than keeping your identity a secret. There was much speculation, therefore, over EsDeeKid - a Liverpool rapper who shot to fame this year but keeps his face hidden under a balaclava, bandana or mask.Some fans suggested the rapper's eyes - the only visible part of his face - bore a striking resemblance to those of Hollywood A-lister Timothée Chalamet, who played along with the mystique when asked about it in interviews.On his next visit to London, Chalamet broke off from the red carpets and chat show sofas to meet the drill star, and the pair collaborated in a music video filmed outside a Finsbury Park off-licence.8. Labubu mania prompts consumer chaosGetty ImagesIf 2025 had a face, it was undoubtedly made of vinyl, with pointy ears, big eyes and a grin with precisely nine teeth.Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and adapted from picture book series The Monsters, the slightly scary-looking Labubu could be seen hanging from everybody's bag this year, with Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Lisa from Blackpink joining in.It's lucky that British people love a queue, as the plush toys prompted long lines around the world. The character's loveable but demonic appearance is said to be matched by its kind-hearted but chaotic personality (same, tbh).9. David Tennant's bonkers Bafta songCamila Cabello was fully on board with David Tennant's Proclaimers tributeHost David Tennant opened this year's Baftas with a barnstorming rendition of I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers - which involved some participation from the A-list crowd.Tennant name-checked Selena Gomez and Hugh Grant as he walked through the audience, but frankly those guys got off lightly compared with what came next.The actor picked on Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Colman Domingo, James McAvoy and Celia Imrie for the call-and-response \"Da da-da!\" bits after the chorus.The facial expressions throughout were priceless. Some were enthusiastically on board, others seemed utterly confused and Jeff Goldblum looked as if he was having the best night of his life. 10. Rachel Zegler's film flop (and theatre triumph)Disney/PA MediaRachel Zegler in Snow White (left) and singing from the London Palladium balcony in EvitaA live action remake of Snow White ran into several controversies ahead of its release in March.Actress Rachel Zegler ruffled a few feathers by criticising the classic original, there were reports of tension between her and co-star Gal Gadot over the conflict in Gaza, and Disney got itself into a right old tangle over what to do about the seven dwarfs. The film bombed. But Zegler took Pitbull's advice and turned a negative into a positive, appearing in a successful West End production of Evita a few months later. A clever stunt which saw her leave the London Palladium stage to perform Don't Cry For Me Argentina from its balcony attracted giant crowds outside. An estimated 130,000 people watched Zegler from the street over the show's run.11. Streaming hits (and misses)Disney/Amazon/HBOL-R: Kim Kardashian in All's Fair, Joe Wilkinson in Last One Laughing, and Aimee Lou Wood in The White LotusAmazon found themselves with a surprise hit on their hands thanks to the first series of Last One Laughing, a reality show about 10 comedians in a house who aren't allowed to laugh at each other.The most viral moment came when Joe Wilkinson was giving a mock-serious speech about the RNLI, only to be pelted with a giant ball of pink paint, for no apparent reason. Glorious.Meanwhile, the third season of wealth satire The White Lotus became one of the most talked about series of the year, and prompted a row over a Saturday Night Live parody that had mocked Aimee Lou Wood's teeth.Kim Kardashian's legal series All's Fair, however, was far less well received with some critics suggesting it \"may be the worst TV drama ever\". But Kardashian made light of the bad reviews by using them to promote the series, which was promptly recommissioned.12. Alan Carr turning into a cold-blooded killer The biggest TV show of the year however, was a triumphant first series of The Celebrity Traitors, and the many viral moments that came with it.Tom Daley's side-eye, Celie Imrie's noisy digestive system, Paloma Faith's early murder, Kate Garraway's theatrics, Joe Marler's \"big dog\" theory and Jonathan Ross's rousing exit speech all contributed to a memorable series.But Alan Carr was the breakout star. We almost feel bad about how much he struggled with being a traitor, but his sweating and discomfort were pure entertainment. Plus, he pulled off an astonishing last-minute win.It led to a career resurgence for Carr, which he was both delighted and miffed about. \"People are going 'Oh, that Alan, isn't he funny?'\" he told Graham Norton. \"I've been on telly for 25 years, I must have been awful!\"13. Adrien Brody's never-ending Oscars speechGetty ImagesBreaking an Oscars record is usually a good thing, but Adrien Brody achieved a dubious honour when he won best actor in February.Accepting the statue for his role in The Brutalist, Brody threw his chewing gum at his girlfriend before delivering an acceptance speech which lasted 5min 40sec - the longest in Academy history. The orchestra tried to play him off, but he waved them off and continued his self-indulgence undeterred. Rumour has it he's still on stage at the Dolby Theatre today.A few weeks later, when presenter Conan O'Brien was confirmed to return in 2026, he joked: \"The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.\"14. The celeb-packed Blue Origin space flightEPAKaty Perry and Gayle King were among six women who took an 11-minute flight to space as part of the Blue Origin voyage in April. They flew more than 100km above earth, giving them a few minutes of weightlessness to enjoy Perry's live rendition of What a Wonderful World. But some commentators said it was \"tone deaf\" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.And there was one fellow singer who made clear she wouldn't be following Perry into orbit...15. Mariah: 'I think I've done enough''Wow': Mariah Carey discovers Katy Perry went into spaceWe'd been aware for a while that Mariah Carey likes to take life at an easy pace these days, as she demonstrated in a less-than-energetic performance at the VMAs in September. But in case there was any doubt, she clarified her feelings about space travel in an interview with BBC Radio 2. The iconic behaviour began when presenter Scott Mills asked her about Perry's trip, and it emerged that the news story hadn't even made it on to Carey's radar (\"Did she go to space?\")Mills followed up by asking whether she would ever flying into orbit herself. In a response that went viral and gave us our new motto for 2026, Carey said simply: \"I think I've done enough.\"",

    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

His mother, Laila Soueif, almost died twice while on hunger strike to push for his release.The most prominent of Egypt's many political prisoners, he was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi in September but was then not allowed to leave the country.Now, removed from the travel ban list, he has flown to the UK to be reunited with his 14-year old son who lives in Brighton.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer wrote on X that he was delighted, saying Alaa Abdel Fattah's case had been a top priority for the government.His sister, Mona, said that hundreds of people around the world had helped bring this moment about and the family could now finally begin to heal.Speaking to the BBC from Cairo in October after his release, he had said: \"I'm learning how to get back into life.\"\"I'm doing much better than I would have expected. Much better than most people would have expected,\" he added.His release in September followed a long campaign by his family - backed by celebrities such as actors Judi Dench and Olivia Colman - and lobbying by the British government.",

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

    "body": "1 hour agoThere is a mix of stories on the front pages of Saturday's papers. The Times reports that King Charles III and the Prince of Wales are expected to visit the US in the new year as part of a Royal \"charm offensive\" to \"woo\" President Donald Trump. The paper says the trip would be the first by a reigning monarch in almost 20 years since Queen Elizabeth II accepted an invitation from George W Bush in 2007.Under a new paid Army gap year scheme, school-leavers will be offered military training to prepare them for combat in war zones, according to the i Paper. The voluntary programme is modelled on Australia's army system and aims to boost recruitment while equipping young people with essential life skills, the paper reports.Moving its focus to the NHS, the Daily Telegraph says that the UK is \"twice as reliant on foreign doctors\" and failing to hire more home-grown medics compared with other Western nations. Recent data from the General Medical Council reveals that around 42% of the country's medical workforce is made up of foreign-trained doctors, while in contrast that figure is 15% in Germany and 11% in France. The top picture spot shows riders, horses and hounds taking part in the traditional Boxing Day hunt in Chiddingstone, Kent.Staying with the health service, the Guardian reports foreign doctors and nurses are \"increasingly shunning\" the NHS because anti-migrant rhetoric and rising racism have created a \"hostile environment\". The paper quotes Jeanette Dickson, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, who says health professionals are seeing the UK as an \"unwelcoming, racist\" country because of the government's strict approach to immigration.In an \"Oxford vaccine breakthrough\", scientists are working on a jab to prevent people from getting cancer which could be available \"within a decade\", the Daily Star reports. The paper says clinical trials for a vaccine to ward off lung cancer are expected to start next year, with efforts to develop more vaccines to stop breast, ovarian and bowel cancers.The Daily Mirror moves on to politics as it reports Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to tackle the cost of living crisis as a top priority in a \"fight Labour must win\". The warning comes from Trades Union Congress chief Paul Nowak, who says the PM must raise living standards or risk losing out to Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, which would be \"a disaster for working class people\", the paper says.Figures show more than 8,000 criminals were freed between January and June this year under Labour's early release scheme, according to the Daily Express. The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, has accused the government of allowing criminals to \"roam our streets\" over the Christmas period.The Daily Mail leads with a \"ghost number plates scandal\" that reveals up to one in 15 cars are fitted with plates invisible to road cameras. The paper says the car registration scheme \"loophole\" has allowed people to use number plates designed to evade detection and could pose a \"grave national security risk\".Investment banking fees have soared to their second-highest level ever thanks to global mega-deals topping $4tn this year, the Financial Times says. Elsewhere, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"heads to Florida\" to meet Donald Trump this weekend to discuss the US peace proposal that will be presented to Russia to end the war in Ukraine, the paper says.Finally, the Sun splashes with late boxing champ Ricky Hatton's \"£40m legacy\" for his children. The paper says the fortune from Hatton's property empire will be split between his three kids.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "11 hours agoLauren TurnerPA MediaThe King's Christmas Broadcast was the most-watched TV programme in the UK on Christmas Day, overnight data has shown.Nearly 7m tuned in on the BBC, ITV, Sky News and GB News to watch King Charles deliver his annual message, this year recorded in Westminster Abbey.After the King, the next most popular show was The Scarecrows' Wedding on BBC One, watched by 4.3m. It is based on the picture book by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, who wrote and illustrated The Gruffalo. All figures are based on \"overnight\" TV ratings - which do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catch-up services during the rest of the festive period.The King used his traditional speech to invoke the wartime spirit, urging people to get to know their neighbours and \"never lose sight\" of the values in which communities came together \"in the face of such great challenge\".The figures also do not include the small number watching the King's message on Sky Showcase, Sky Mix HD or other non-TV platforms.Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas Special - which saw Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman host the show together for the final time - was the third most popular programme, with 4.2m tuning in.They ended the festive special with their \"keep dancing!\" catchphrase, with Winkleman saying the audience watching over the years had \"meant a world to us\". There was a drop in viewers for EastEnders however, eighth most-watched this year with 2.85m for the first of its two Christmas Day episodes. The second did not make the viewing figures top 10. Soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale, both on ITV1, did not make the top 10 with their Christmas Day episodes. This year, BBC programmes made up nine of the top 10 most-watched programmes across the day. A festive episode of the 1% Club, the quiz hosted by Lee Mack, on ITV1, was in ninth place with 2.75m watching.The BBC's chief content officer Kate Phillips said this was \"a timely reminder that shared moments really do still matter even in a world of so much choice\".

The video has received significant attention from figures like JD Vance and Elon Musk since being uploaded, prompting the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to declare the agency would target \"blatant fraud that seems to be rampant in Minnesota\".\nDespite the administration’s response to the story, some mainstream media outlets have not found evidence of fraud, while some conservatives feel the story has not had enough attention in the wider media. What’s the truth behind Nick Shirley’s claims and what does it mean for Minnesota and its Somali community?\nAnd, Zohran Mamdani has been sworn in as New York mayor. He delivered a speech outside City Hall promising to show the world that America’s political Left can govern. What are the obstacles he’ll face in that journey as mayor, and how much will it hinge upon his relationship with Donald Trump?\nHOSTS:\n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH:\n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB\n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast\nThis episode was made by George Dabby with Grace Reeve.

    "body": "2 hours agoThe US's capture of Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro and large-scale strikes on the South American country dominate Sunday's papers. \"America on the warpath\" is the Mail on Sunday's lead as it splashes its front page with the image of a blindfolded and shackled Maduro after his arrest by US special forces shared by Donald Trump.The Sunday Telegraph follows with Trump's comments that the US will \"run\" Venezuela after Maduro's capture. The US president held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago and told reporters \"We're going to run the country right\" and \"It's going to make a lot of money\".The Sunday Times also uses Trump's line that the US will \"run Venezuela\", but goes further, with a quote from the US president describing the \"unprecedented military action\" as something \"people have not seen since World War Two\".Maduro's picture aboard the USS Iwo Jima also echoes on the Observer's front page, alongside the headline \"America's captive\". The Sunday Mirror features comments from a defence expert who says, \"The US has acted illegally\" in its attack on Venezuela and seizure of Maduro. The Venezuelan leader and his wife will now be taken to New York and face trial on drug and weapons charges, the paper reports.\"Nicked\" says the Sun as it features side-by-side pictures of the captured Maduro and explosions seen in Venezuela's capital of Caracas.The Sunday Express focuses on Trump's praise of the \"brilliant operation\" in Venezuela, saying \"air, land and sea was used\" for an attack \"people have not seen since World War Two\".The Independent uses the same image that appears across most of Sunday's papers, and includes Sir Keir Starmer's comments that the UK was not involved in Saturday's large-scale strikes on Venezuela.\"Peace loving Trump attacks Venezuela\" is the Daily Star's lead. The paper asks whether Fifa will take back the inaugural peace prize it awarded the US leader in December.Related Internet Links",

    "body": "4 hours agoTom McArthurandNick JohnsonGetty ImagesThe managers of a bar where a fire killed 40 people and injured another 119 have been placed under criminal investigation, Swiss prosecutors have said. The French couple - named by the media as Jacques and Jessica Moretti - are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said. Eight Swiss nationals from among those killed were the first to be identified on Saturday. The likely cause of the fire at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana was sparklers on bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, a preliminary investigation found. In a statement, Beatrice Pilloud, the lead prosecutor in the canton of Valais, said investigators were looking into whether the venue's acoustic foam was \"the cause of the problem\", as well as \"whether it complies with regulations\".Among the dead and missing are many teenagers. Le Constellation was a venue known to be popular with a younger crowd in the ski resort town, where the drinking age is 16. A teenage golfer from Italy was the first death to be named, though Swiss and Italian officials have so far declined to confirm his death.Swiss authorities have not released the names of the eight people whose identification was completed on Saturday - all aged 16-24. Bunches of flowers, soft toys and messages of love and hope are piled up outside the police barriers outside the bar.On Saturday, families were being directed to a conference centre just outside Crans. Members of the Italian Civil Protection team met people there, together with Italy's Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado.Ambassador Cornado said the identification process should be completed by Sunday afternoon.The slow process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered, the ambassador added.A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117",

    "body": "7 hours agoHayley CoyleYorkshireBBCSir Patrick Duffy died on 2 January after a short illnessThe oldest former Member of Parliament, Sir Patrick Duffy, has died aged 105 following a short illness. The miner's son, from Doncaster, first stood for parliament in 1950 and held the  Sheffield Attercliffe seat for Labour between 1970 and his retirement in 1992.Sir Patrick died on 2 January at Doncaster Royal Infirmary and a family friend said everyone who knew him, \"across all age groups\", would miss his kindness and humour.Kevin Meagher, who helped him write his second book, called him a \"living historical jukebox\" and added: \"Patrick's was a life well-lived, brimming with achievement, the admiration of colleagues and the love and affection of his many family and friends.\" Sir Patrick was born in Wigan in 1920 before his family moved to Doncaster for work in the South Yorkshire coalfield, where his father, James, was a miner.He told friends some of his earliest memories were the mining strikes of 1926, and according to the Guardian, he said he was a \"political animal\" from the age of five. Sir Patrick went on to serve in the Fleet Air Arm during World War Two and survived a terrible crash at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands - he was even read his last rites twice age 23 but went on to fly again. The crash also left him with severe facial injuries which required him to undergo experimental plastic surgery. After the war, Sir Patrick studied at the London School of Economics before taking a doctorate at Columbia University in New York and went on to become an economics lecturer at Leeds University. He first stood for Parliament in 1950 in Tiverton, Devon, and then successfully contested Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, in a by-election in 1963. He was a defence minister in James Callaghan's Labour government in the late 1970s and president of the NATO Assembly in the 1980s, working alongside many heads of state as the Cold War came to an end, including Pope John Paul II.In later life, Sir Patrick went on to hold a number of academic positions and remained a respected voice in the field of naval warfare. A committed Catholic, he received his papal knighthood in 2017 and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991. Sir Patrick Duffy at the launch of his second book, From Wigan to Westminster age 103After retiring from Parliament, he undertook several pilgrimages including the famous Camino de Santiago, a 35-day walk of 15.5 miles (25km) each day, which he completed annually for six years.Mr Meagher also said: \"He could remember, you know, Oswald Mosley speaking in Wigan in 1930 and then pretty much everything in almost total recall on events from that point onwards, really - incredible mental acuity, even into a very old age.\"Sir Patrick published his second book, From Wigan to Westminster: Hot Wars, Cold Wars and the Carrier Strike Groups, aged 103, making him the second-oldest published author in the world.Paying tribute, Sally Jameson, MP for Doncaster Central, said: \"I am deeply saddened to hear that Sir Patrick Duffy has died.  \"He was loved in Doncaster and will be very much missed and my condolences go to all his family and friends.\"Mr Meagher added: \"He will be greatly missed. God rest his soul.\" Sir Patrick lived with his three beloved dogs in Doncaster near the colliery where his father worked and is survived by his sister Patricia.More on this story",

    "body": "5 days agoJonathan GeddesGlasgow and West reporterBBCDr Tori Herridge visited Kelvingrove Park to witness the skatepark excavation, When archaeologists began work on the site of Scotland's first skatepark last August, there was one prominent question being asked - when had the ground actually been filled in?It was a mystery solved through research, hard work - and a chocolate wrapper more than 40 years old.A team from the University of Glasgow team worked with volunteers and students to excavate the former Kelvin Wheelies park in Kelvingrove Park.Now the work on the skatepark will feature in an episode of the BBC's Digging For Britain programme, due to air 7 January.The skatepark opened in May 1978 and featured bowls, a slalom run and a half-pipe, all with names like Jaws, Torpedo and Bazooka.At the time it was considered state of the art and hosted events like the Scottish Skateboarding Championship, but several years later the site was out of commission, after a decline in popularity, concern about maintenance costs and safety risks.Exactly when it closed was a matter of debate, though.Speaking to Digging For Britain host Dr Tori Herridge, Dr Kenny Brophy of the university of Glasgow explained that while it was known that the skatepark was out of use by the early 1980s, an exact date had not been confirmed.He said: \"Even the smallest bit of evidence could help us say when this was backfilled, because there is actually no record of when this happened. Everyone is saying was it 1982 or 1983 or 1984, but no-one remembers exactly when. \"It's amazing how quickly people forget - archaeology can bring those memories back.\"Iain UrquhartThe skatepark was popular in the late 70s, but fell out of fashion a few years laterThe team, which included a number of modern skaters who use the current park at Kelvingrove - yards away from the original site - then got to work, using the same techniques that would be used on sites hundreds or thousands of years old.They analysed soil and rubble within the original slalom they discovered, while on another section members of the team discovered two white lines - which they eventually guessed was a way of telling skaters where to aim for when performing a trick.Skaters young and old gathered to appreciate the discovery - one younger skater said hearing about the old park was like \"hearing fairytales\" and like nothing she had ever skated on before.Another called the find interesting because skateboarding has changed so much, meaning parks like the 1970s one no longer exist.See Scotland's first skatepark in its 80s heydayFor Jamie Blair, who owns Glasgow skateboarding shop Clan Skates, the excavation brought back many memories.He was a member of the Kelvingrove skateboard team, and as a teenager would perform tricks and flips on a regular basis at the Kelvin Wheelies.     \"It was a great shame that this park got filled in, it broke a lot of skateboarders' hearts,\" he told Dr Herridge.\"It was good to roll back, and see it, and it was fun trying to find things you remembered from the past – 'oh, this is where that was…'  \"My other reaction was 'jeez, am I that old?' - I was literally digging up the bones of my childhood! But skateboarding is alive and well, so it's all good.\"The best before date of a chocolate biscuit provided evidence for when the park had closedHowever, it was later in the dig that the team were finally able to establish a more definitive date for when exactly the skatepark had closed.The solution involved Scottish football great Denis Law, and a couple of popular chocolate brands.\"In terms of dating some of the material, we have been quite lucky,\" says Kieran Manchip, a project officer with Archaeology Scotland. \"We were able to find sweetie wrappers that had best before dates on them. So we have a six pack of Penguin biscuits  and on the rear side it says 14 March 1983, and we found a lovely Twix wrapper at the bottom of the rubble. \"It says 21 May 1983, so we know the site was backfilled by May 1983.\"We found a hologram sticker or poster of Denis Law wearing a Man Utd shirt, which can be dated to the early 70s (Law left Manchester United in 1973).\"The processes are the same with archaeology – you can apply them to any time in the human past.\"Part of the original skatepark was unearthed during the digDr Brophy hopes the work on the skatepark site will help ensure it is remembered by future generations. In Jamie Blair's case, the excavation brought the past flooding back.\"I remember the laughs you had, your friends, your teammates. We were just crazy for skateboarding.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoLeigh BoobyerWest of EnglandA convicted murderer is one of two inmates on the run from police after absconding from prison on New Year's Day.Matthew Armstrong, who was convicted in the late-2000s of a murder which happened during a robbery in Warwickshire, left HMP Leyhill in South Gloucestershire along with Daniel Washbourne who has previous convictions for violence.Avon and Somerset Police said they are believed to have left the open prison at a time between 17:00 and 20:00 GMT on 1 January.The force said they are not from the local area, and have links to various parts of the country. Members of the public are urged to call 999 immediately if they see them.A third man who is suspected of absconding at the same time was arrested in Bristol on Saturday.Open prisons have \"minimal security and allow eligible prisoners to spend most of their day away from the prison on licence to carry out work, education or for other resettlement purposes\", according to the Ministry of Justice.HMP Leyhill has an operational capacity of about 825 inmates.Police have released CCTV footage showing what the men were wearing on New Year's Day.Armstrong, 35, was last seen wearing a burgundy or orange coat, grey cap, grey tracksuit suit bottoms with blue on the side, and black boots.He is described as white, male, about 5ft 9ins, with ginger hair and scars on his forehead.Police said he has known links to Warwickshire.Washbourne, 40, is described as white, male, about 5ft 6ins, slim, with brown hair and clean shaven.He was last seen wearing a cream coloured fleece, blue tracksuit bottoms, blue hat and black trainers. He has known links to Herefordshire.Police said officers understand he has previous convictions for violence against a person offences and false imprisonment.HMP Leyhill reported the absconders to the force on Thursday evening, and police attended the prison at about 21:45 GMT to start carrying out enquiries.\"Urgent actions\" have been completed, police said, \"including circulating the men as wanted via national police systems\". Intelligence work to trace the men's movements is ongoing and other police forces have checked linked addresses but not found them.A Prison Service spokesperson said: \"Absconding is a serious criminal offence, and any prisoner who commits this crime could face longer behind bars.\"The police are working urgently to recapture these individuals, and we urge anyone with information to go to the police.\"",

    "body": "Two die and sea search for third person called off9 hours agoEmma Petrie,East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire,Jessica LaneandKevin Shoesmith,in WithernseaDarrin StevensTwo people have died and a third person is missing after a major search and rescue operation off the East Yorkshire coast.An eyewitness described how people entered the water at Withernsea to try and save a young woman shortly after 15:00 GMT on Friday.On Friday, a 67-year-old man was pulled from the water and died at the scene before a second body was recovered in the evening, Humberside Police said.HM Coastguard started the second day of searching for the missing person at first light but said the search been stood down at 16:00 on Saturday afternoon and would not be resumed.  HM Coastguard initially responded to reports of a \"number of people in difficulty in the water\" at the seaside town.Police did not provide the gender or age of the second body they recovered, and said the circumstances were not suspicious. Kevin Shoesmith/BBCGeorge Gouldson says he saw three people in the water George Gouldson, 73, was taking photographs of the stormy seas from his car when the incident began.He said he saw people \"running towards the towers\", a local landmark on the promenade.\"I saw three people in the water before others got in. One of the people in the water was a female.\"A bloke was trying to throw a life ring to her, but it wouldn't reach her. The tide just took her. She was swept away, along the length of the beach, towards the rocks. The water was that fierce. \"A load of people were trying to get to her. One bloke got out of the water. I picked him up and sat him against a wall. He looked to be hypothermic.\" BBC/Jessica LaneConditions at the scene have been described as \"horrendous\" as snow and ice warnings apply across much of the UKMr Gouldson, who returned to the scene with his dog on Saturday morning, said he did not see the woman or the two other people emerge from the water.\"It's something you see on television, not in Withernsea,\" he added.\"My mind just won't settle. It's just so sad.\"Janice Holgate, 60, drove 17 miles (27km) from her home in Hull to lay flowers at the scene.She said: \"It breaks my heart what has happened. It's an awful start to the year. I just wanted to do something.\"Kevin Shoesmith/BBCJanice Holgate lays flowers close to the scene of the tragedyWithernsea Methodist Church opened its doors for prayers on Saturday morning.The Reverend Ian Greenfield said he had received messages from all over the country offering support.\"When we realized the severity of it and the tragedy of it, we felt it was really important that we had our church open this morning for people to come along.\"For people to be able to come and pray and to receive emotional support,\" he said.BBC/Jessica LaneMembers of the coastguard resumed searches at first light on SaturdayThe incident was first reported at 15:10 on Friday, resulting in a major search involving a rescue helicopter, air ambulance and RNLI crews from Withernsea, Bridlington and Hornsea Inshore Rescue.  The search was paused at about 00:30 on Saturday and resumed at first light.A spokesperson for HM Coastguard said teams from Hull, Withernsea, Hornsea and Bridlington were sent to the scene at 06:30 to continue the search.At Withernsea, snow began to fall just after first light and those searching have been battling bitterly cold and windy conditions along with driving snow.Snow and ice warnings are covering much of the UK over the weekend and beyond and a yellow warning is in place for the east coast of England until 23:49 on Saturday.BBC/Amanda WhiteReverend Ian Greenfield says the community has received messages of support from across the UKA police spokesperson said: \"Residents will continue to see an increased police presence in and around the area as the search continues.\"We continue to ask that people avoid the area to allow emergency services to work efficiently and safely.\"Hornsea Inshore Rescue said on Friday it had faced \"horrendous conditions\" and there had been 9.8ft (3m) waves.The operation has involved about 100 members of the emergency services, including Yorkshire Ambulance and Humberside Fire and Rescue.Download the BBC News app from the App Store for iPhone and iPad or Google Play for Android devicesRelated internet links",

    "body": "Donald Trump's warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed was \"reckless and dangerous\", Iran's foreign minister has said.Abbas Araghchi's comments came after the US president said Washington \"will come to their rescue\" of demonstrators taking part in protests over Iran's economy, writing in a brief social media post: \"We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"Araghchi indicated Iran's armed forces were on standby and \"know exactly where to aim\" in the event of an attack.At least eight people are reported to have died during the week-long protests, as of Saturday morning.Trump wrote on Friday: \"If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\"The US president did not specify what action Washington might take. Previously, it has carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, which elicited a retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.\"Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,\" Araghchi wrote on X.Iran would \"forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs\", he added.On Saturday Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei addressed the wave of protests, saying that \"rioters must be put in their place\". He said shopkeepers' original protest about the collapse in foreign exchange rates was \"legitimate\", but he claimed people \"provoked by the enemy\" were taking advantage to shout anti-government slogans.Protests have spread to a number of cities and towns with running battles reported between security forces and demonstrators. On Saturday the state-affiliated Mehr and Fars news agencies reported that two protesters and a member of the security forces were killed in the western town of Malekshahi when, they said, protesters tried to enter a police station.The EU said it was \"concerned\" by reports of deaths and called for Tehran to exercise \"maximum restraint\" against the protesters as well as upholding their right to \"freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly\".The protests began in Tehran, with shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.By Tuesday, university students were involved and the protests had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.Two people have since died in clashes between protesters and security forces in the south-western city of Lordegan, according to the semi-official Fars news agency and the human rights group Hengaw, which said they were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.Three people were killed in Azna, while another died in Kouhdasht, all in the west of the country, Fars reported. It did not specify whether they were demonstrators or security forces personnel.One death was reported in Fuladshahr, central Iran, and another casualty in Marvdasht, in the south.BBC has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The demonstrations have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly, but they have not been on the same scale.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has previously said he will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.

    "body": "4 hours agoAna FaguyWatch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfoldedUS President Donald Trump has said the US will \"run\" Venezuela until a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" can be ensured, after US strikes led to the capture of country's President Nicolas Maduro.US oil companies would also fix Venezuela's \"broken infrastructure\" and \"start making money for the country\", Trump said. The US launched strikes on Venezuela on Saturday in which Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and removed from the country. Venezuela announced a state of national emergency and denounced the \"military aggression\", with the country's vice president saying Maduro is its only leader. The US attorney general said Maduro had been indicted on drugs and weapons charges. Speaking at a news conference, Trump said: \"The oil business in Venezuela has been a bust, a total bust for a long period of time.\" \"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country.\"The South American country has approximately 303 billion barrels worth of crude, accounting for about 20% of the world's oil resources, according to the US Energy Information Administration.Trump on Venezuela: \"We are going to run the country\"It is unclear exactly how the US plans to \"run\" Venezuela, but the president said it will be a \"group\" of people leading the charge.\"We're going to be running it with a group, and we're going to make sure it's run properly,\" Trump said.  When pressed by reporters as to who inside Venezuela would form part of that group, Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been talking to Delcy Rodríguez, the country's vice president.Trump said Rodríguez had expressed her willingness to do \"whatever the US asks\".However, speaking on state TV after Trump's remarks Rodríguez called Maduro the \"only one president in Venezuela\", adding that the government was ready to defend itself. Earlier, Rodríguez was the first Venezuelan official to speak out publicly after the US strikes, urging the US to provide a proof of life for Maduro and his wife.In the early hours of Saturday, the US launched a \"large-scale strike\" on Venezuela in which Maduro and his wife were captured by US forces and flown out of the country, before being transported on board USS Iwo Jima. US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Maduro and his wife, First Lady Cilia Flores, had been indicted in the Southern District of New York.\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi wrote on X.Previously, Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.Watch: Smoke, bangs and helicopters in CaracasSince September, the US has launched more than 30 strikes on what it says are boats being used for drug trafficking in the Pacific and the Caribbean, killing more than 100 people.The Trump administration has described the strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific as attacks against terrorists attempting to bring fentanyl and cocaine to the US, however the authorities have provided no evidence to back up its allegations.With the exception of two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorean national - none of the identities of those on board have been made public.Earlier this week, the conflict escalated further when the US carried out a strike on a \"dock area\" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats.Fentanyl is produced mainly in Mexico and reaches the US almost exclusively via land through its southern border.Counter-narcotic experts have also said that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking. It mainly acts as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.",

    "body": "2 days agoPA MediaMany parts of the UK have experienced cold and snowy weather this winter.  Like people, pets can need extra help to stay warm and safe during wintry conditions. How do I keep my pet warm indoors?Like humans, animals can be at risk of hypothermia if they become too cold.The RSPCA says pets can shiver when they are exposed to low temperatures for too long. This is more noticeable in smaller and short-haired breeds.The PDSA veterinary charity advises giving dogs and cats extra blankets for their beds over the winter months and adding a few more spaces where they can curl up around the home.Raising their beds off the ground can keep older dogs away from draughts, while cats may like playing or resting in high-up dens or on climbing posts. Experts recommend extra playtime to make sure pets keep active if they are spending less time outside. Indoor toys can help.Your pet may want to eat more to help keep their body temperature up. At the same time, they may also want to drink less, but make sure they have constant access to fresh drinking water to avoid the risk of dehydration.RSPCA: Keeping pets safe in cold weatherPDSA: Pet care advice for winterShould I still walk my dog during cold weather?PA MediaDogs still need walks during cold weather. Usually, their fur will keep them warm. But some dogs - particularly those with shorter fur - may need extra help staying warm while outside.\"For most dogs, their own lovely fur coat is insulation enough, but those with thin fur, or who are unwell, very old or young, may benefit from a good winter coat,\" according to PDSA's Gemma Renwick. \"Look for something well-fitting, waterproof but with a comfy lining.\"Walk your dog during the day if you can, or if you have to go out in the dark, consider using LED collars or hi-vis leads to ensure they can be seen. Be cautious when letting dogs off the lead in the snow, and supervise them closely as hazards may be hidden. Similarly, keep pets away from frozen water as the ice on ponds and lakes can be thin and may not support their weight. As the temperatures drop, plan for shorter, more frequent walks rather than one long-distance daily hike and if your dog gets wet, make sure you dry them off with a towel as soon as you get home.Any build-up of salt, grit, dirt or snow can be painful, so owners should check and rinse their pet's paws.What about rabbits and guinea pigs during cold weather?Smaller pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs and ferrets can also feel the cold.The PDSA says a sudden drop in temperatures can be a shock to the system for the animals, and recommends moving them inside if they live in outdoor hutches.A shed or car-free garage can offer a good amount of protection from draughts, rain or snow. If you have to bring your animals inside, try and put them in a room which you can keep a bit cooler than the rest of your home. Turn down the radiators if you can. If there is no inside option, the charity advises placing a thick blanket or piece of carpet over their outside living quarters to help keep them warm. Should I keep my cat inside?Angela/BBC Weather WatchersMany cats spend a lot of their time exploring the outdoors. During the day, experts say cats who are used to going outside should continue to do so.But the PDSA advises making sure can easily get back inside through a cat flap whenever they want, or have a warm outside shelter where they can go.Ideally cast should stay inside overnight during periods of very cold weather.The charity also recommends providing litter trays inside, even if your cat usually goes outside so they have a warm toileting option. How should I care for chickens in the winter months?Chickens and hens are incredibly resilient and should typically cope well with a bit of cold weather, the British Hen Welfare Trust says. However, during extreme conditions, the charity recommends:making sure your birds have a robust shelter, and that any hen houses are insulatedfor larger hen houses, putting a cardboard box on its side for your hens to sleep inchecking their water supply regularly to ensure it hasn't frozen checking boundaries regularly to ensure they are safe from predators. Fence posts may become loose in wet weather, giving foxes or badgers east access to the animals",

    "body": "1 hour agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsGetty ImagesFor many, this weekend marks the final pause of the Christmas break - a moment when most are still officially off work, but mentally edging closer to what comes next. After weeks of late nights, family time and a slower pace, the shift back to routine can bring a mix of reluctance, anxiety and low energy – even if you don't dislike your job. Psychologists and workplace experts say that feeling is common and the challenge is less about finding the motivation to return to work and more about adjusting your mindset. That mindset starts with how you frame the weekend, Sunday in particular.Make plans to beat the Sunday scaries Beth Hope, an executive coach, says \"Sunday blues\" are very common and usually come from anticipatory stress, where the brain predicts a high demand on Monday and \"activates the stress response early\".Hope says one of the most effective strategies in dealing with Sunday scaries is to \"create a gentle bridge between weekend and work mode\" so the return doesn't feel so abrupt. Some of the simplest ways to do that include:Planning Monday's top priority on Friday afternoon, giving the week \"a clear starting point rather than an overwhelming one\"Keeping Sunday evenings calmer and lighter on screens to reduce stimulation and allow the brain to settleAvoiding 'soft launches' into work, such as checking emails or mentally planning tasks late on SundayGetty ImagesPacking your bag or laying your clothes out the night before work can help reduce mental clutter Hope also suggests being more intentional with how the final day of the weekend is spent. If switching off feels difficult, schedule something absorbing like exercise, seeing friends or doing something creative that fully occupies your attention.Hope adds that creating small and familiar rituals like going for a short walk, taking a warm shower or laying out work clothes for the next day can also make a difference, particularly if you feel mentally scattered. If worries still linger, especially at bedtime, Hope says a \"thought download\" can help.\"Spend a few minutes writing down tasks, worries or decisions that are looping in your mind to help externalise mental clutter. \"Once it's written down, the brain no longer feels the need to rehearse it, which can reduce anxiety and improve sleep.\" For those who find the anxiety of Sunday extending well beyond Monday morning, Denise Byrne, a wellness coach, says the problem is often not motivation, but overload.\"After an extended break, it's common for motivation and concentration to feel lower than expected,\" says Byrne. Rather than seeing this as a failure, January should be treated as a transition and reset period where you intentionally design how you want to work going forward.\"She recommends a reset built around three key practices:1. Use a time audit to regain clarity and control\"In your first few days back, take note of how your time is actually spent,\" Byrne says. Many people react to emails, meetings and demands, then wonder where the time has gone.Tracking things like meetings, screen time and focused work \"highlights where time is leaking and what's genuinely productive\". With this information you can \"reduce unnecessary meetings or create more protected focus time, rather than slipping back into habits that don't serve you\".2. Identify energy drains earlyJanuary, Byrne says, is an ideal time to notice which tasks, conversations or ways of working leave you feeling depleted. \"Pay attention to when your energy dips and what tends to cause it\" as once those patterns are clearer, they can be managed more intentionally.\"That means you could group draining tasks together, shorten meetings or schedule demanding work at times when energy is naturally higher.\" 3. Build structure to reduce feeling overwhelmedAfter time off, structure can feel restrictive, but Byrne says the opposite is true as \"structure creates freedom\". Time-blocking your calendar, batching similar tasks and prioritising certain bits of work can reduce mental overload and decision fatigue. \"When everything feels urgent in January, having a clear system helps you focus on what truly matters and prevents overwhelm from creeping in early in the year.\"Getty ImagesUnderstand what you're spending most of your time on at work and what is draining your energy That experience resonates with Lesley Cooper, the CEO of a consultancy business, who says it's \"inevitable that there is reluctance about ending time off and getting back into a routine\". Although she doesn't feel great about returning to work, she focuses on \"deliberate rituals like a regular sleep schedule, good nutrition and hydration to feel like I am taking structured responsibility towards getting back into the swing\". As soon as she returns to work she also sets herself some clear, meaningful but achievable tasks that are purposefully quite small so she can \"feel a sense of accomplishment rather than defeat from the outset\".Cooper adds that she also tries to \"be intentional about scheduling time in the first days back to catch up with people, human to human, before diving back into task mode\".As a leader, she encourages her team to do the same. \"I try to keep expectations lower in the first few days back to avoid that sinking feeling of 'here we go again... too much to do and not enough time to do it.'\"",

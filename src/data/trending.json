    "body": "6 hours agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron warned that \"today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder\"French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself on the world stage, saying it is time to start acting like a \"power\".In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and now the US, he told a group of European newspapers that the continent faced a \"wake-up call\".\"Are we ready to become a power? This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems. \"In another era we might have said it is the moment to 'assume our majority',\" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense -  eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.Macron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility. \"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives… \"For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.Calling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too.  Europe today is the most open market in the world.\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory,  Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.\"Don't believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.",

    "body": "'Skilled butcher' murdered, cut up and buried partner14 minutes agoGeorge TorrDerbyDerbyshire PoliceAnna Podedworna was convicted of murder by a jury on TuesdayA \"skilled butcher\" has been found guilty of murdering her partner before cutting her body in two and burying her remains in the back garden of a house more than 15 years ago.Izabela Zablocka was first reported missing in 2010, and her remains were found buried in Princes Street, Derby, on 1 June 2025.The discovery came, Derby Crown Court heard, after Anna Podedworna, 40, of Boyer Street in Derby, contacted Derbyshire Police last year, telling them the body would be found there. Prosecutor Gordon Aspden KC said \"mounting pressure\" caused Podedworna to \"crack\" and email the police last year when a Polish television journalist flew to the UK to interview her.Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressingOn Tuesday, Podedworna was convicted of murder by a jury, as well as perverting the course of justice and preventing a lawful burial.Podedworna showed no emotion when the jury returned their verdict, after deliberating for seven hours and six minutes.She will be sentenced on Wednesday.Derbyshire PoliceIzabela Zablocka's remains were discovered in a garden - almost 15 years after she was reported missingThe jury was told the two women had moved to the UK together from Poland in search of work and lived in the Normanton area of Derby.The prosecution said Zablocka phoned her mother in Poland on 28 August 2010 and was not heard from again.Aspden said shortly after this call, Zablocka was murdered by Podedworna, who \"dismembered Izabela's body by cutting it in half with a large knife\".Police discovered the defendant had previously been employed as a \"skilled butcher\", and her work involved \"deboning, and portioning out turkey carcasses using a large knife\".The court heard the body was buried in the back garden, before concrete hardstanding was then laid over the top.The jury was also told Podedworna emailed police on 21 May 2025, saying she wished to provide evidence in relation to Zablocka's disappearance. Zablocka's body was buried in her back garden, before concrete was laid over the top, the court heardShe told officers three days later they would find her body buried in the garden in Princes Street, the court heard.But Podedworna claimed Zablocka died by \"accident\" during a violent confrontation, and claimed she ended up killing her partner in \"self-defence\". The jury was told \"considerable force\" would have been needed to cut Zablocka's body in half, and that electrical tape had been used to bind her legs together before she was buried.Aspden said it was not known why Zablocka was murdered, but there was \"evidence of sexual jealousy\" between her and Podedworna.He described their relationship as \"a stormy and turbulent one\".The court heard men had found Podedworna sexually attractive, which \"caused suspicion, jealousy, and conflict\" in her relationship with Zablocka.Kasia, the victim's daughter who was still living in Poland when Zablocka went missing, told police she believed her mother wanted to undergo gender reassignment surgery but could not afford to, Aspden said.Zablocka was reported missing by her family to UK police in November 2010 and then to police in Poland in January 2011, the court heard.In 2024, Zablocka's daughter, now an adult, contacted Polish organisation Missing for Years, who contacted Podedworna via Facebook.Podedworna claimed that she did not know where Izabela was and that she did not know what had happened to her.A year later in May 2025, Rafal Zalewski - a Polish TV journalist - requested an interview with Podedworna, which the court heard \"proved to be a tipping point\".Derbyshire PoliceZablocka's daughter Kasia was still living in Poland when her mother went missingDet Insp Kane Martin, of Derbyshire Police, said Podedworna was \"a self-proclaimed, deceitful and manipulative liar\".He added the killer's \"chilling account\" to police and subsequently the jury, was \"vague and emotionless\".He said: \"She clearly thought her careful and considered disposal of Izabela and the lies she told in the years that followed would help her to avoid responsibility for what she had done.\"Having cut Izabela in two, she did no more than throw her in the bin as she awaited the opportunity to dig the filthy grave and bury her in the dead of night.\"She then removed all trace of Izabela - lying and obstructing justice in the years that followed.\"Podedworna is a selfish individual, concerned only about the impact upon herself.\"Derbyshire PoliceZablocka, the court heard, phoned her mother on 28 August 2010 and was not heard from againSamantha Shallow, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Izabela Zablocka came to Derby in search of a new life with her partner, but instead met her death.\"Anna Podedworna not only brutally murdered her partner, but she subjected Izabela's loved ones to 15 years of uncertainty and anguish, not knowing if she was alive or dead.\"Podedworna hid the truth for years, but justice has caught up with her.\"Her callous actions took a mother and daughter away from her family and denied them the opportunity to grieve her passing and lay her to rest.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "49 minutes agoCaitlin WilsonReutersUS lawmakers say files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were improperly redacted ahead of their release by the Department of Justice (DOJ).Members of Congress on Monday were allowed to begin a review of the unredacted versions of the approximately three million pages of files released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) since December. \"The core issue is that they're not complying with... my law, because these were scrubbed back in March by Donald Trump's FBI,\" Democratic Representative Ro Khanna told MS NOW. At least one document has been unredacted since the lawmakers' complaint, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying on X: \" The DOJ is committed to transparency.\"The files' redactions came under scrutiny last week after lawyers for Epstein's victims said the latest tranche of files included email addresses and nude photos in which the names and faces of potential victims could be identified. Survivors issued a statement calling the disclosure \"outrageous\" and said they should not be \"named, scrutinized and retraumatized\". The DOJ said it had taken down all the flagged files and that mistakes were due to \"technical or human error\".After viewing the unredacted documents, Massie and Khanna, who co-sponsored the law which compelled the release of the Epstein files last year, told reporters they had a list of about 20 people in which every name was redacted except for Epstein's and his convicted sex trafficker associate Ghislaine Maxwell.Six of the names could even belong to men who are \"likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files\", Massie said outside the DoJ on Monday night, before posting a screenshot of the redacted file online and demanding an explanation. These names were \"inappropriately\" redacted, Khanna said on MS NOW.In response to their concerns, Blanche said his department \"just unredacted all non-victim names from this document. The DOJ is committed to transparency.\"He linked to what appears to be a new version of the file - which he said contains the names of Epstein victims, whose identities the EFTA law orders the government to conceal - with only two names now blacked out.Blanche also responded to two other files highlighted by Massie, saying those files do not obfuscate any substantive information.But Khanna said those measures taken after the documents' release are still not in compliance with the EFTA law, which passed nearly unanimously in Congress and was signed by President Trump in November.\"Trump's FBI scrubbed these files in March,\" Khanna said on social media. \"The documents (the Department of) Justice [received] had the redactions that the FBI made back then.\"They need to unscrub the FBI files so we know who the rich and powerful men are who raped underage girls.\"Massie said the incorrect redactions show the justice department \"need to do a little more homework\" in their handling of the files.\"What we found out is those 302 forms were redacted before they got to the DOJ,\" in contradiction of the law's order for the FBI - which is part of the DOJ - to un-redact information before sending it to Blance and Attorney General Pam Bondi's office.Who is in the Epstein files?Among the redactions flagged by Massie on Monday night was a document appearing the show an email exchange between Epstein and an unknown person discussing a \"torture video\" and travel between China and the United States.Massie claimed that \"a Sultan seems to have sent this\" and demanded the hidden identity be revealed. Blanche quoted Massie's post on X, saying the blacked-out text is an email address.\"The law requires redactions for personally identifiable information, including if in an email address. And you know that the Sultan's name is available unredacted in the files,\" he said. \"Stop grandstanding,\" he added.Massie also complained that the name of a \"well known retired CEO\" was missing from the publicly available version of an FBI document listing potential Epstein co-conspirators. Within hours, Blanche said that name - which already appears elsewhere in the files - had also been uncovered.\"DOJ is hiding nothing,\" he wrote.Representatives Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, and Lauren Boebert, a Republican, were among the lawmakers who viewed the documents on Monday. \"I think there are folks who are definitely implicated\" named in the files, Boebert said. Raskin complained that the limited way in which lawmakers could view the unredacted files amounts to a \"cover up\".\"The DOJ is giving Members of Congress just four computers in a satellite office to read the unredacted Epstein File of more than 3 million documents,\" he wrote on X, calculating that it would take Congress seven years to read it all.",

    "body": "Buy an island for £350k... but you must wade across an estuary to reach it6 hours agoNicholas BourneandAngela Ferguson,BBC WalesCarter JonasThe sale has already prompted \"a lot of interest\", the estate agents sayBuying your own private island off the Welsh coast does not necessarily require a lottery win, but waterproofs are a must if you are to negotiate low tide back to the mainland.Ynys Gifftan, a tidal island, sits in the picturesque Dwyryd Estuary just a stone's throw from Portmeirion in Gwynedd.The 17-acre island comes with a Victorian stone farmhouse that was inhabited until the 1970s but is now in \"need of extensive renovation\", according to Carter Jonas estate agents in Bangor.Archives recount how former occupiers in the 20th Century used to remove their shoes to wade back and forth to the mainland.Steve Berry | Dyfi ArchitectureFor sale: The 17-acre island has become somewhat overgrown with vegetation but it includes a farmhouse, all accessed via a tidal estuaryYnys Gifftan was gifted to landowner Lord Harlech's ancestors by Queen Anne in the 1700s and its name translates into English as Anne's Gift Island.During high tide it can be accessed by boat, but during low tide a short walk is required across tidal sands to the mainland.Surveyor Elis Jones said: \"I don't think we have ever sold an island before.\"There has been a lot of interest. It certainly is different.\"Arthur C Harris / Geograph.org.ukThe farmhouse - pictured here in 2018 - is in need of \"extensive renovation\", agents Carter Jonas sayJones said they would be organising accompanied viewings on the island, which was also formerly used for grazing sheep. Anyone viewing the island has been warned by the agents to \"take care and caution throughout inspections and to remain vigilant at all times for their own personal safety\", given the potential risks \"including the access route, terrain and tidal conditions\".Hugh O'Donnell, from Carter Jonas, said the island was \"a truly unique opportunity for a buyer who appreciates its exceptional location and potential\". \"We expect interest from buyers looking for an exciting lifestyle project in one of Wales' most beautiful coastal landscapes or someone who is looking for their very own secluded haven,\" he added.Anonymous | Geograph.org.ukThe island overlooks the mainland with Portmeirion, an Italianate village which is popular with tourists, on the opposite shoreA listing on the Rightmove website described the island as set in an \"expansive and unspoilt landscape with uninterrupted panoramic views\" across the coastline and mountains in Eryri National Park.\"The land has become overgrown in places and would benefit from grazing and general land management to restore it to its full potential and productivity,\" the listing adds.The Royal Geographical Society's Discovering Britain guide advises anyone who wishes to visit the island to check the tide times, as it is only available on foot for up to three hours either side of low tide.\"The island is completely cut off and impossible to reach at high tide without a boat. Yet, on the ebb tide it only takes five minutes to walk the 400-metre route to the island,\" the online guide states.It also cautions that there are two river channels that flow between Ynys Gifftan and the mainland.\"If you reach these and they are too deep to cross, for safety, you must turn back,\" the guide adds.More top storiesRelated links",

    "body": "4 hours agoAurelia FosterLondonPA MediaThe reverse of the pendant shows the letters 'H' and 'K', thought to reference Henry VIII and Katherine of AragonThe British Museum has successfully raised £3.5m to keep a gold pendant linked to King Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife, Katherine (also Catherine) of Aragon.It has now announced that it reached its fundraising goal after receiving £360,000 in public donations and a string of donations from grants, trusts and arts organisations.Museum director Nicholas Cullinan said: \"The success of the campaign shows the power of history to spark the imagination and why objects like the Tudor Heart should be in a museum.\"PA MediaThe pendant features a banner that reads \"tousiors\" - the old French for \"always\"Research led by the British Museum has revealed that the Tudor Heart pendant may have been made to celebrate the betrothal of their two-year-old daughter Princess Mary to the eight-month-old French heir-apparent in 1518.The pendant unites the Tudor rose with Katherine's pomegranate symbol and features a banner that reads \"tousiors\", the old French for \"always\".After it was found, the pendant was reported under the Treasure Act 1996, which gives museums and galleries in England a chance to acquire historical objects and put them on display.In order to put the pendant on permanent display, the museum had to pay a reward to the metal detectorist who made the discovery and the owner of the land it was found on.PA MediaThe museum believes the pendant may have been made for celebrations to mark their daughter Princess Mary's engagement to the French heir apparentThe museum was keen to keep the Tudor Heart as it believed that few artefacts related to Henry VIII's marriage to Katherine of Aragon have survived.Since the appeal, it said, more than 45,000 members of the public had contributed to the cause, helping it raise just over 10% of its £3.5m goal.It also received £1.75m from The National Heritage Memorial Fund, which aims to save the UK's most outstanding, at-risk heritage treasures.Other donors include the charity Art Fund, the Julia Rausing Trust and The American Friends of the British Museum.Cullinan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The fact 45,000 members of the public have got behind this and donated money to keep it on the country on public display shows the enthusiasm for this object - it really is unique.\"I think this is such an important part of our history. Very little survives around the marriage of Katherine of Aragon to Henry VIII.\"I want to say a heartfelt thank you to everyone who supported our campaign.\"Simon Thurley, chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said: \"The Tudor Heart is an extraordinary insight into the culture of Henry VIII's court, and I am delighted that Memorial Fund support will enable it to go on public display.\"The museum hopes to formally include the pendant in the collection later this year and has plans for it to tour the UK in the future.More stories like thisRelated internet linksGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "body": "'Funny, warm, and no car chases' - Michael Palin on his return to TV acting1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterBBCSmall Prophets marks Sir Michael's first TV acting role since 2019's Worzel GummidgeSir Michael Palin has said he was attracted to the \"humour and magic\" of Small Prophets - the new BBC drama that marks his first TV acting role in seven years. Critics have heaped praise on the new comedy series from Detectorists creator Mackenzie Crook, which follows a man who creates tiny creatures capable of foretelling the future and answering any question.Sir Michael said he was attracted to the series because it \"deals with people in a very empathetic, human way\".\"This is not a story where you'll have car chases and people wanting to kill each other,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. \"There's a warmth in the way [Crook] writes about people.\"Every single character in this series, gets their moment, however small it might be, it might be two lines or one line, and that line is thought out, careful, and is given to the actor as something special,\" he continued.\"So what Mackenzie does is a very personal kind of writing, where if you like it, it's just the best of all to do, because it's so sympathetic to people.\"Lauren Patel (left) and Pearce Quigley also star in Small ProphetsSmall Prophets centres on Michael Sleep (played by Pearce Quigley), whose partner Clea vanished seven years ago. After a tip-off from his elderly father, played by Sir Michael, he begins cooking up an ancient recipe involving rain water, horse manure, and a little alchemy, to create folkloric creatures who can predict the future.\"They are called homunculi,\" explained Sir Michael, \"which I don't think anybody knows anything about, apart from Mackenzie.\"[He] found them in a book somewhere that there was proof that many many years ago, a man had found a recipe to create little people in jars - a magical alchemist.\"Sleep hopes he can help him find his wife. \"So what seems a very strange thing, becomes magical and quite helpful and improving, and helps him in his quest for his lost partner,\" Sir Michael explained. The series follows Michael (played by Quigley) as he attempts to create small creatures in jarsSmall Prophets marks the actor and presenter's first TV acting role since playing the green man in Worzel Gummidge, which was also written and directed by Crook. The former Monty Python star described Crook as a \"marvellous writer, one of the most original\".He said Crook's latest series is \"quite incisive, it's not dreamy, he writes very funny lines, very tart and quite sardonic in their way\".\"It's all about life in the suburbs of south Manchester, and he can find in that world an amazing amount of humour and magic, and good people doing very funny things.\"Five-star reviews\"If there is a message or a moral, it is that there are still wonderful things at hand in a world that might seem like it is running out of them,\" he said.\"The existence of Small Prophets proves the point: that British telly can still create impossible marvels like this is a reason to keep believing in magic.\"\"Even if this didn't have a supernatural storyline, Crook is already a magician, someone whose joyous storytelling can make you feel strangely and intensely alive,\" he said.The blending of the mundane and the magical \"may not suit every palate\", said the Telegraph's Anita Singh in her four-star review, \"but this is clearly a labour of love for Crook.\" \"Admittedly, some components jar – a cackling colleague at the DIY store feels misplaced, and the final instalment of the six-part series takes an unwanted detour into horror. \"However, Quigley is wonderful; a character in whose company one would happily while away the hours.Also awarding four stars, the Independent's Patrick Smith advised readers: \"If the show's magical realism gives you pause, don't be put off: you'll be rewarded with something funny, strange, and surprisingly accessible. \"Like Detectorists before it, this is a series that wrings emotion from the commonplace and everyday – only this time, the treasure Crook has buried is altogether more peculiar. Small Prophets brings large returns.\"Small Prophets is available now on iPlayer. ",

    "body": "There are a few reasons we don't tend to see as many records set at the Winter Olympics compared to the summer Games.One of the explanations is the fact Winter Olympics venues and tracks are not identical in size and layout across the years.Over the various editions of the Games, tracks and courses have been designed differently for the host venues.This variation makes it difficult to get a consistent record time for speed.For instance, the men's alpine downhill skiing at the 2026 Games is 2.14 miles long, whereas the 2022 course was just 1.96 miles.This is also the case for other sports such as sled sports, snowboard and cross-country skiing.However, short track and long track speed skating have all been contested over the same distance at every Winter Olympic venue and world championship over the years.That consistency means that there are official Olympic and world records for these sports.Norway's Sander Eitrem broke the Olympic record for the men's 5,000m speed skating at the 2026 Games.Other sports are scored by judges, based on the skill and execution in a sport.Figure skating is a judged sport, but does not have an upper limit to the scoring.Since the 2018 Games, an International Skating Union (ISU) judging system has been used for Olympic records.USA's Nathan Chen holds the men's single records, with the highest points in the short, free and combined events.Athletes in the ski and snowboard big air events are given a score out of 100, marked across four broad categories: difficulty, execution, amplitude and landing, with extra points also available for progression - pulling off new unseen tricks that 'progress' the sport.This article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.",

    "body": "'Mum is still out there' - Savannah Guthrie issues new plea as ransom deadline passes3 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: \"We are at an hour of desperation\", says Guthrie in new plea for missing motherUS news presenter Savannah Guthrie has said her family believes their abducted mother is still alive, as she issued a new appeal to anyone with information.\"We believe our mum is still out there,\" she said in a video posted to her Instagram account. \"We need your help.\"As a reported ransom deadline for the safe return of Guthrie's mother Nancy passed on Monday, officials said they had still not identified a suspect or person of interest.The 84-year-old disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will.ReutersThe family had earlier indicated that they would be willing to pay for her safe return.The FBI said they are not aware of \"any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers\". It is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for any information. The FBI also said it is taking an email with a ransom note sent to US media outlets stating the Monday deadline seriously, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.A previous alleged deadline for ransom, which was meant to be paid in Bitcoin, passed on 5 February. Nancy was reported missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.The family has released three other videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential abductors, and asking for proof that their mother is still alive.\"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" Savannah Guthrie says in the latest clip, in which she appears alone unlike previous recordings where she has been joined by her siblings.   \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help,\" Guthrie says.Guthrie requests people everywhere, \"even if you're far from Tucson\", to report anything suspicious that could lead to clues about her mother.She continues: \"If you see anything, if you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement\".In an update just before Monday's deadline, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said it did not have any new information to release publicly. The sheriff's statement added that the \"investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing\", and that \"the FBI is handling all aspects related to any ransom note(s) or communications involving the Guthrie family\".The FBI also released a statement, saying that FBI agents from around the country \"continue to deploy to Tucson\".\"We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,\" the FBI statement added, including the number for the FBI's tip line.'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's message in a previous video",

    "body": "Captivating chemistry or a hollow misfire? Wuthering Heights splits critics 1 hour agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterWarner BrosEmerald Fennell's reimagining of Wuthering Heights is being released to coincide with Valentine's DayEmerald Fennell's hotly anticipated reinvention of Wuthering Heights, starring Australian A-listers Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie, has divided film critics ahead of its release this Valentine's weekend.Emily Brontë's gothic tale of passion, obsession and revenge follows the affair between the free-spirited, wilful Cathy and the tortured but cruel Heathcliff.The movie has been attracting attention and some controversy since it was first announced, over its casting and apprently BDSM-inspired scenes.Warner BrosSet in the late 18th and early 19th Century, Wuthering Heights stars Elordi, 28, and Robbie, 35, as famous literary lovers Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw.The film is being marketed using quote marks - \"Wuthering Heights\" - to imply that this is Fennell's personal take on the famous novel, while Brat singer Charli XCX has written an accompanying album soundtrack.The Guardian's Bradshaw said Fennell \"cranks up the campery\" with her reinvention, which he describes as \"a 20-page fashion shoot of relentless silliness, with bodices ripped to shreds and a saucy slap of BDSM\".The Telegraph's Collin anticipated criticism from some that the movie might lack depth, but issued a robust defence of the film.\"Style over substance? Not at all - it's more that Fennell understands that style can be substance when you do it right,\" he wrote.\"Cathy and Heathcliff's passions vibrate through their dress, their surroundings, and everything else within reach, and you leave the cinema quivering on their own private frequency.\"Getty ImagesThe film's UK premiere saw the red carpet backdrop recreated to look like the Yorkshire MoorsPublisher Mills & Boon was referenced in more than one review, with the Sun's Dulcie Pearce suggesting the film had replaced chunks of Brontë book with pages from the romance novels.\"This over-stylised drama is fierce and fun - but unfortunately it is also sex over substance,\" Pearce wrote.\"Robbie and Elordi's performances are almost pushed to the border of pantomime, while Fennell's provocations seem to define the poor as sexual deviants and the rich as clueless prudes.\"\"As the sexual tension cranks, the mood feels like an arthouse Carry On, with lingering shots of gloopy egg whites,\" he wrote. \"The rest of the movie grabs the attention so hard, Charli XCX does the soundtrack and you don't even notice.\"Leigh wasn't the only critic to compare Wuthering Heights to a Carry On film.In a three-star review, the Irish Times's Donald Clarke noted that \"the surprise for many will be how closely this supposed deconstruction sticks to the shape of Emily Brontë's original narrative\".He pointed out that the opening scene was \"closer to Carry on Heathcliff than The 120 Days of Sodom\".There was another three-star review from Empire's Beth Webb, who described the film as \"undeniably expertly crafted\".\"Fennell throws everything at this fever-dream adaptation, which massages the senses while showcasing Elordi's ever-growing star power,\" she said. \"If only its electrically erotic energy was sustained to the end.\"Getty ImagesEmerald Fennell's previous films include Saltburn, which also had an element of shock value\"The leads are captivating and their chemistry sizzles,\" he said. \"Robbie is in full bloom, walking a tightrope between infuriating recklessness and devastating regret.\"Fennell's overhaul flirts with insanity, and if you can let go of preconceived notions about how this story should be told, it's arguably the writer-director's most purely entertaining film.\"There was more praise for the pair's on-screen relationship from the Standard's Vicky Jessop, who gave the film four stars, writing: \"Robbie and Elordi have bags of chemistry in this unashamedly high-camp adaptation of Emily Bronte's book.\"Emerald Fennell serves us full-throated, filthy maximalism,\" she added.Referencing Robbie's star turn in Greta Gerwig's Barbie blockbuster, he described Robbie as a \"Brontë Barbie\" and argued that Fennell has \"doomed Elordi with a fatally shallow characterisation, recasting Heathcliff as pouty man-candy with a shaky Yorkshire accent.\"Wuthering Heights opens in the UK on 13 February.",

    "body": "10 hours agoEmily HoltRebecca SommersRebecca says she wanted to reignite a fading connection with her partner after they became parents.Rebecca has been with her husband for 10 years, but since having three children over the past three years she has grown \"disconnected\" from him. \"We are just cohabiting, like we're not a couple. We are just parents,\" she says. Like many parents, they struggle to find time to spend alone.\"Our kids are so young and they are so demanding that it's hard to even get five minutes to catch up and we're both exhausted come the end of the day.\"She says the dynamic of her relationship changed after she gave birth to her first child. \"We knew it was going to be different when we started trying for our first baby, but I think the gravity of it, we weren't expecting how different it would be.\" In Rebecca's case, her whole life has changed as she's switched from working full time to becoming a full time mother, and says she has struggled to open up with her partner about her feelings. \"His life is still his life. He does see how hard it is for me at home and also our relationship, he knows it's affected, but he'd never bring it up.\"Getty ImagesKate Moyle, psychosexual and relationship therapist, says it's normal for relationships to change after becoming parents.\"There's nothing that can prepare you for becoming parents. You think you know yourselves really well as a couple,  and then everything you think you know about someone is gone.\"The early years are typically the toughest with studies suggesting relationship dissatisfaction is often highest within the first three years of a child being born.Kate says making changes to improve your relationship is not about trying to get back to life before children, but about adapting.\"It's never going to look the same as it looked before, but we have to think about it in a new way now.\"Make time to hug and kissShe advises thinking about the small things such as eye contact or touch that you can do with the time you have in the day together to make you feel like a couple again. \"We call this sexual currency in my world, which is, you know, a hand squeeze, a hug, a quick kiss, anything that makes you connected.\"And when we have those opportunities, drop everything else and just prioritise that.\"Kate says small actions like this can have a big impact on improving a romantic relationship.\"When you're in the thick of it, that's not the time to say we need to change everything.\"She says a kiss or a touch then become bridges for bigger moments of intimacy and connection in the relationship. Be open about how you feelKate also recommends using a quiet moment to be honest about how the relationship is going.\"Their attention is the thing that we often miss. We feel separate, and then we think that our partner also feels separate, and we have this gap between us.\"Like friendships and families, Kate says you have to invest and nurture your relationship throughout, not just at the start.\"It takes work and adaptation and paying attention when we feel like we have nothing left.\"Spend time together without the kidsSam Owen, relationship coach and author, says after children you often need to \"get to know each other\" again, suggesting dates or conversations about interests outside your kids.Dates could include things like massages, checking into a hotel with a creche facility, playing games, getting creative with paint or drawing or cooking a nice meal together,\" she says. \"It's consciously creating a habit of connecting so it becomes part of your relationship.\" She says physical intimacy is also important.\"It's a vital glue for keeping your relationship together, it helps improve communication and reduce couple conflict.\" Since talking to CBeebies Parenting Helpline about her relationship, Rebecca says her and her husband have done several different things to improve their relationship.She says they now make sure they have meals still together with their children, but without their phones, which she says makes conversation flow easier without distractions. They also make sure they spend some time together each evening after they have put the kids to bed, often watching a film or TV show which she says means they now have an offiical time to relax together.\"Relationships take work, if you both want it then you will always find a way back to each other, don't shy away from the hard conversations and hold tight,\" says Rebecca.Other stories you may enjoy",

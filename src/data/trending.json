    "body": "15 hours agoKatya AdlerEurope editorBBCDowntown Munich is best-known for chic shops and flashy fast cars but right now its streets are bedecked with posters advertising next generation drones.\"Europe's security under construction\" boasts the slogan on an eye-catching set of sleek black-and-white photographs, festooned across a scaffolding-clad church on one of this town's best known pedestrian boulevards.Such an unapologetic public display of military muscle would have been unimaginable here just a few years ago, but the world outside Germany is changing fast, and taking this country with it.The southern region of Bavaria has become Germany's leading defence technology hub, focusing on AI, drones and aerospace.Advertisements such as these that say \"Europe's security under construction\" would have been unthinkable in Germany not long agoPeople here, like most other Europeans, say they feel increasingly exposed - squeezed between an expansionist Russia and an economically aggressive China to the east, and an increasingly unpredictable, former best pal, the United States, to the west.According to a recent Eurobarometer poll, more than two-thirds of Europeans (68%) feel their country is under threat.This autumn, Germany's Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance warned for the first time since the Cold War that war is no longer \"unlikely\". While emphasising that this is a safe country, it also recommends that Germans keep food supplies to last three to ten days at home. Just in case.Germany is the number one single donor of military and other aid to Ukraine, now that the US has halted any new direct aid. Opinion polls suggest voters here want to feel better protected at home too.AFP via Getty ImagesGermany is now the single biggest giver of aid to UkraineThe question for this country, along with others in Europe is whether traditional alliances with the US, in Nato and the EU can suffice, or whether they should be diversifying into ad-hoc coalitions alongside other like-minded nations such as Australia, South Korea and Japan?Precarious relationsBy 2029, the German defence budget will be higher than the UK and French equivalents combined, Nato's Secretary General Mark Rutte pointed out to me.He described the €150bn they say they will spend on defence as \"a staggering amount\".It's something the United States notices and appreciates, he said. Donald Trump is far from the first US president to insist that Europe do more for its own security, though his tone has been noticeably more threatening than that of his predecessors.The precarious state of transatlantic relations was the main focus of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) this weekend. It's the world's biggest annual defence meeting, bringing leaders, security experts and defence industries together.Mark Rutte (pictured speaking to Katya Adler), described the E150bn Germany will spend on defence \"a staggering amount\"While it's easy to dismiss speech-heavy get-togethers like this as wind-baggy talking shops, in the turbulent times we live in, they can make a difference - especially the informal private huddles between global decision makers, far away from the glare of the cameras.The most eagerly - and for some the most anxiously - anticipated speech at this year's conference was that of the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who represented the Trump administration here.European leaders and top diplomats were seriously on the edge of their seats. But why was a simple 30-minute address given so much importance?It's because Europe-US relations have never been so frayed as they are now, over the last 80 years since World War Two. And this isn't a bust-up between buddies that will easily blow over.Denmark still furiousIn the just over 12 months since Trump returned to the White House, he has at times insulted and undermined European leaders, slapped big tariffs on their exports, and most shockingly of all to his allies in Nato, threatened Danish sovereignty over its territory, Greenland, refusing for a while to rule out taking the island by force.Speaking at the MSC on Saturday, Denmark's still clearly furious prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Trump's designs on Greenland remained \"the same\" despite ongoing trilateral talks between representatives of Greenland, the US and Denmark.Trump has ruled out taking Greenland by military force for now, and he's backed away (for the moment, at least) from slapping economic sanctions on allies, including the UK, France and Germany, that were getting in the way of the US acquiring the Arctic island. But transatlantic trust was severely damaged.European powers see in Trump a truly transactional president who thinks nothing of leveraging security or economic relations with his closest allies to get what he wants. Just before being re-elected president, for example, he told Europeans that the US would not protect nations that didn't pay their way on defence.It is true though, that Europe has been coasting on America's security blanket for decades. Critics in the US argue that European nations have been able to run generous welfare states for decades while Washington picked up the tab for security spending.AFP via Getty ImagesThe speech by US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio (left) was the most eagerly anticipated at the conferenceGermany's defence minister, Boris Pistorius, told me on Saturday: \"We got used to the strong support from the US;  we got used to our comfort zone in which we used to live. This time is over, definitely over,\" he said. \"Washington was right.\"But the crisis over Greenland and other actions by the Trump administration - such as when it temporarily paused intelligence-sharing with Ukrainian forces last March, leaving them blind on the battlefield, in order to pressure Kyiv into engaging in peace talks with Moscow - have left deep scars and a troubling sense of transatlantic wariness.Hence the trepidation in Munich before Rubio took the stage.In the end, his words were laced with a sense of historic kinship. \"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"The two great wars of the last century serve for us as a constant reminder that ultimately our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"I found it telling that so many leading European figures in the audience jumped on the warmth of his words, rising to their feet to applaud the US Secretary of State. They were clearly relieved he hadn't threatened or berated Europe as the US Vice President JD Vance famously did at last year's MSC.But for those listening closely, Rubio's speech was loyal to themes close to the heart of the Trump administration and hard for many European leaders to swallow: anti climate action, sceptical of globalisation, multilateralism, migration and pro the building of a new era of Christian western civilisation.Rubio was clear: the US wasn't interested in allies clinging to the old status quo. It wanted to forge a new path, ideally alongside Europe, but only if it shared the same values.This US offer of close partnership was conditional and absent of a sense of compromise.\"A bit like a (psychologically) abusive partner,\" said one European diplomat, speaking candidly on condition of anonymity. \"He reminded Europe how wonderful the (transatlantic) relationship used to be, but he then switched to coercion: If you want things to be good between us in the future, you have to do as I say!\"Another diplomat pointed out that, while talking of shared values, it was telling, he said, that of all the European countries that Rubio could have gone to after making his speech in Germany, he chose to visit Slovakia and Hungary before heading back to the US.They are viewed by Brussels as two of the EU's most problematic members, both with Eurosceptic nationalist prime ministers who oppose sending military aid to Ukraine and who are tough on migration.A fragile new relationshipRubio's softer tone also divided European leaders who had recently spoken as one, in defence of Denmark, at the height of the Greenland crisis last month.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, underlined a now fragile relationship with the US, despite Rubio's gentler rhetoric. \"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" she said. \"Europeans have suffered shock therapy.\"But will some countries in Europe grasp what warmness there was in Rubio's speech as an excuse not to rush to boost defence spending as promised? The coffers of most European governments are over stretched already and their voters tend to prioritise cost-of-living concerns over defence budgets.Reuters\"Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore,\" according to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der LeyenRachel Ellehuus, Director-General of defence think-tank RUSI told me she sees a rift opening up across the continent.On the one hand, you have the Nordic and Baltic nations that are geographically close to Russia, and also Germany and the Netherlands, which are all big defence spenders, she says, whereas in southern Europe, there's Spain, for example, that is absolutely unapologetic about refusing to increase defence budgets to the levels demanded by Donald Trump.France and Britain are both verbally committed to boosting defence spending, says Ellehuus, but are still looking for a \"political band aid\" to help them explain to voters the trade-offs that will involve - higher taxes, less welfare or more borrowing.\"Europeans need to get to work yesterday and to focus,\" she says. \"They have 5-10 years to stand on their own two feet in terms of conventional defence capabilities.\"Last week, U.S. Undersecretary of Defence Elbridge Colby couldn't have been more stark in his messaging at a meeting of Nato defence ministers he attended in Brussels: Europe was no longer a US priority, the Indo-Pacific was.\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are reprioritising the defence of our homeland and the protection of our interests in our Hemisphere,\" he said.While he emphasised that the US remained committed to Nato's mutual defence clause, where an attack against one member is viewed as an attack against all, Colby insisted the US would be reducing its capabilities in Europe, becoming \"a more limited and focused\" presence.Europe had to become a partner, rather than a dependent, he said, calling for a new \"Nato 3.0\". The old world order with the West at its core, has faded but the MSC this weekend made clear that what comes next for Europe and the US is still very much up in the air.Marco Rubio called for a new century of western civilisation, Elbridge Colby wants a re-vamped Nato, while the UK's prime minister appealed in Munich for the western alliance to be re-made.Starmer's nuanced approachIn stark contrast to Marco Rubio's insistence on greater national sovereignty, Sir Keir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defence - to cut re-armament costs, though, he emphasised this did not mean the UK turning its back on the United States.Sophia Gaston, national security expert at Kings College London, told me that in Munich, Starmer was able to better articulate the nuance of Britain's strategic outlook.\"Other allies in Europe may be more willing to speak of divergence from Washington\", she says, \"but for Britain it remains a strategic imperative to triangulate within the Transatlantic relationship. There will also be times when Britain will have to make hard choices, and Starmer appeared more confident in confronting that reality.\"The key is to have a really strong grasp of the national interest and our instruments of power and influence. This requires a much more competitive approach that has not always felt natural to Britain, which has typically pursued much of its diplomacy in elegant, consensus-focused and invisible ways.\"PA MediaKeir Starmer spoke in favour of greater integration between the UK and Europe on defenceIn these fast-moving, unpredictable times, Europe's leaders are increasingly turning to a la carte coalitions, alongside traditional organisations like Nato or the EU, which are larger and therefore often slower to react. These groupings also include non-European nations.Take, for example, the so-called Coalition of the Willing group of countries, led by the UK and France and formed to secure Ukrainian sovereignty in the case of an eventual peace deal with Russia. Turkey has attended coalition meetings, as have New Zealand and Australia.More from InDepthCanada is increasingly working alongside Nordic and Baltic nations that share geopolitical challenges and common values, they say, and want to promote stability and deterrence from the edges of the Baltic Sea, through the Nordic and Baltic states, through the North Atlantic, Greenland and across the Canadian arctic.One European policy-maker who asked not to be named joked to me that Canada was becoming \"more and more European by the day\". Japan and South Korea were increasingly seen as part of the \"like-minded family\" too, he said.Not just defenceThese ad hoc coalitions are not restricted to defence alone. France's President Macron has long called for Europe to increase what he calls its strategic autonomy, in traditional security terms but also energy security, supply chains and new technologies. In Munich he recommended Europe \"de-risk\" from all outside powers.This weekend even saw the president of the European Commission admitting that if the EU failed to move fast enough on improving competitiveness, \"a group of its member states would have to move forward alone\".Attempts by smaller pockets of European powers to work together to advance European strategic independence are by no means always successful. Take the current row between France and Germany over their joint attempt to come up with the next generation of fighter jet with the Future Combat Air System (FCAS).You could also say that for all the talk of building European independence, this weekend's conference was also a reminder of just how dependent Europe remains on US security support - from its nuclear umbrella to intelligence sharing and command and control structures. It was also a reminder of how far Europe trails the US in high tech innovation.But more than short-term mechanisms designed to 'survive' Donald Trump, the changes we are witnessing in Europe, including closer alliances outside the continent, are liable to be longer lasting. The world now seems to dance to the tune of big power politics. And even slow-moving Europe is having to adapt.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

All 29 passengers have been rescued, while one of the injured was sent to hospital, police said.Switzerland has experienced heavy rain and snow in recent days, and the country's Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research says the avalanche risk is very high across the alps.\"According to initial findings, an avalanche may have crossed the tracks shortly before the train passed,\" police stated, adding that the public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation.\"Five people were injured. One of them was taken to hospital,\" police added.The regional commuter train was on its way from Spiez to Brig when it derailed.Goppenstein, a key hub for road and rail transport, sits at the exit of the Lotschberg rail tunnel. The train derailed as it was exiting the tunnel, police said.The region is under its second highest avalanche warning - level four of five.Heavy snow also resulted in 50 people being evacuated from the village of Orsieres, near the French border.Skiers have been warned by authorities to stay on the marked slopes, and those walking in the mountains should also check avalanche bulletins before setting off.Last month, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing in the Swiss alps.",

The 16-year-old boy previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter.Woolwich Crown Court was told the teenagers believed Cashford, 49, was a paedophile after he met the girl by chance at an amusement arcade two days earlier and gave her his phone number.Using the alias Sienna, the three teenagers had messaged Cashford and arranged to meet him by the sea wall.Danny Robinson KC, defending the girl, told the court the texts started as a \"big laugh\" but might have become a wish to name-and-shame Cashford.\"It was a childish escapade that got out of hand very quickly with tragic consequences,\" he said.Footage shows the moment Alexander Cashford was attacked on the beachProsecutors said Cashford was chased and hit with rocks and a bottle before he was found lying face down in the mud.A post-mortem examination showed injuries to his face and head, bruises on his limbs and body, alongside a number of fractured ribs that had punctured his lung.The 16-year-old boy had earlier told the court how he and the others had discussed giving Cashford a \"slap\" before the attack.He claimed he attacked Cashford because he thought police \"wouldn't have done anything\" if they had reported the man for trying to meet up with the girl.'Relentlessly pursued'The girl filmed the boys chasing Cashford as she shouted \"get him\", the court heard.After he was arrested, the 16-year-old boy shared footage of the attack with three people. \"This was a carefully pre-planned deliberate and violent attack on someone who was not expecting it and who could not defend himself,\" said Natalie Smith, senior crown prosecutor from the Crown Prosecution Service. \"Despite his best attempts to flee, he was relentlessly pursued and attacked, even when witnesses reported he was lying on the ground.\"The three teenagers – who cannot be named for legal reasons – were acquitted of murder on Monday.They are expected to be sentenced for manslaughter in April.\"These verdicts will change their lives forever,\" said the judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb.More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "1 hour agoEmma SaundersCulture reporterWatch: Robert Duvall honoured in Hollywood 'hand and footprint ceremony' in 2011Robert Duvall, who starred in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, according to US news reports.The Oscar-winner died \"peacefully\" at his home in Middleburg, Virginia on Sunday, according to a statement sent by his PR agency on behalf of his wife, Luciana.\"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,\" she said in a statement.\"His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.\"Getty ImagesShe continued: \"For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented. In doing so, he leaves something lasting and unforgettable to us all.\"Thank you for the years of support you showed Bob and for giving us this time and privacy to celebrate the memories he leaves behind.\"Duvall was known for numerous tough-guy roles over an impressive six-decade career, such as the mafia consigliere in The Godfather and the forceful army officer in Apocalypse Now.He only had a few minutes of screen time but his famous line in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 classic, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning\", became legendary.His role in the Vietnam war epic made him a star.The character was originally meant to be even more over the top but Duvall toned it down and the name was changed from Captain Carnage to  Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore.\"I did my homework,\" Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. \"I did my research.Nominated for seven Oscars, Duvall won best actor in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.His other roles included a bullying corporate executive in 1976's Network, and a Marine officer in 1979's The Great Santini, as well as parts in 1990's The Handmaid's Tale and 2014's The Judge alongside Robert Downey Jr.Duvall often said his favourite role was as the Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove in the 1989 TV mini-series, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.Getty ImagesDuvall (left) appeared opposite Marlon Brando in The GodfatherHe made his screen debut in the 1963 film adaptation of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, playing the reclusive Boo Radley.The screenplay was written by Horton Foote, who also wrote several other films Duvall starred in, including Tender Mercies, Tomorrow and The Chase.",

    "body": "1 hour agoBeth RoseDisability affairs reporter PA MediaHate crimes which target people on the grounds of their sexuality or gender identity, or a disability, are set to become aggravated offences under a proposed new law.An amendment to the Crimes and Policing Bill will mean a crime is aggravated if a victim is targeted because of those characteristics, and will carry a higher penalty.The LGBT+ anti-abuse charity Galop described the amendment as a \"landmark moment\" for equality.The bill, which is currently progressing through the House of Lords and is not yet law, is intended to introduce measures to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour and will apply to England and Wales.Currently, crimes found to include an element of hostility against a person's LGBT or disability status can be acknowledged with an \"uplift\", which increases the sentence on a broader charge such as assault.The new amendment will set them out as defined charges within their own right, which comes with a higher maximum sentencing penalty.It also brings them in line with race and religion, which already have defined charges, such as racially-aggravated disorderly behaviour.Jasmine O'Connor, co-chief executive of Galop, said:  \"At a time when our services are seeing consistent rises in LGBT+ hate crime victims seeking support, this long-overdue change sends a clear message that anti-LGBT+ hate crime is as deserving of justice as crimes motivated by religious or racial hate.\"Labour MP Rachel Taylor, who first put forward the amendment, said that between March 2024 and 2025 more than 30,000 hate crimes against people in England and Wales had been recorded by police as linked to their sexual orientation, transgender identity, or disability.She said she was \"absolutely delighted\" by the \"vital change in the law\", adding that \"this represents a great stride forward in equality for disabled and LGBT+ people\".The government said it had responded to Taylor's amendment as part of a commitment it made in its manifesto.Campaign group Stonewall, which had been lobbying for the change to the law, described it as a \"powerful message\" that showed people \"deserve equal access to justice\".Chief executive Simon Blake said Stonewall and other groups had \"campaigned hard for this change for many years\".\"We welcome that the government is delivering on a manifesto commitment for LGBTQ+ people at a time when many in the community are feeling increasingly under threat,\" he added.As well as sexuality, gender identity and disability, the amendment also covers victims targeted because of their sex - something the government says its part of its mission to halve violence against women and girls in the next decade.The Crimes and Policing Bill is currently at the report stage in the Lords and is yet to be signed into law.",

    "body": "2 hours agoCBS via Getty ImagesDuvall played mafia consigliere Tom Hagen in The Godfather and The Godfather Part II Robert Duvall was a distinguished and prolific screen actor who lent a brooding intensity and grizzled authority to seven decades of American film-making.Nominated for Academy Awards on seven occasions, he won best actor for his role as a troubled country singer in 1983's Tender Mercies.His many other roles included a mafia consigliere in The Godfather, a bombastic army officer in Apocalypse Now, and a Texas Ranger-turned-cattle driver in Lonesome Dove.More character actor than leading man, he could be relied upon to inject a feisty, fiery machismo and a cantankerous contrariness into the most mainstream Hollywood offering.Born Robert Selden Duvall in January 1931 in San Diego, California, Duvall was a self-proclaimed \"navy brat\" due to his father's life-long career in the United States Navy.His father expected him to follow him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. Yet his son instead served two years in the army following his 1953 college graduation.Getty ImagesDuvall and Dustin Hoffman, pictured in 2014, studied acting together in the 1950sDuvall subsequently moved to New York to study acting, working as a postal clerk to make ends meet. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman, who both became lifelong friends.\"A friend is someone who many years ago offered you his last $300 when you broke your pelvis,\" he would later recall. \"A friend is Gene Hackman.\"Duvall began acting professionally at the Gateway Playhouse, a summer theatre in Long Island, where he starred in plays by Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and others.His performance in Horton Foote's one-act play The Midnight Caller led the playwright to recommend him for the role of Boo Radley in the 1962 film version of To Kill a Mockingbird.By that time, Duvall had already appeared on television in such shows as Naked City, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Armstrong Circle Theatre.To Kill a Mockingbird, which Foote adapted from Harper Lee's novel, was the actor's first film role and led to appearances in such films as The Chase, Bullitt and True Grit.Getty ImagesDuvall played the reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a MockingbirdThe Rain People, released in 1969, marked his first collaboration with director Francis Ford Coppola, with whom he would go on to work in the first two Godfather films.Other significant roles around this time included the highly strung Major Burns in Robert Altman's M*A*S*H and THX 1138, the eponymous protagonist of George Lucas's dystopian 1971 sci-fi debut.Duvall's performance as The Godfather's Tom Hagen, the shrewd chief advisor to Marlon Brando's ageing Don Vito Corleone, earned him his first Academy Award nomination in 1973.He reprised the role in 1974's The Godfather Part II, by which time he had collaborated with Foote again in the 1972 film of his play Tomorrow. Network, from 1976, cast him as a venal television producer.Meanwhile, there were appearances with Michael Caine in The Eagle Has Landed, Laurence Olivier in The Betsy, and Muhammad Ali in the boxer's biopic The Greatest.Getty ImagesRobert Duvall (centre) on the Apocalypse Now setIn 1979, Duvall gave perhaps his most memorable performance as Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore in Coppola's Vietnam war epic Apocalypse Now.\"I love the smell of napalm in the morning,\" his character famously declared after leading a deadly helicopter attack on a Vietnamese village.The actor was shown to no less domineering effect in The Great Santini, playing a frustrated Marine pilot who hectors and browbeats his teenage children.The scene in which he torments his son by bouncing a basketball against his head was spoofed by Mike Myers' Dr Evil in the second Austin Powers film.Duvall's work in Apocalypse Now and The Great Santini saw him nominated for Oscars in consecutive years. The former also earned him a Bafta and the first of four Golden Globe awards.Yet it was his role as alcoholic singer Mac Sledge in Tender Mercies that finally saw him land an Oscar, beating an all-British line-up of fellow nominees that included Caine and Albert Finney.Getty ImagesDuvall was named best actor at the 1984 Academy AwardsDuvall's other Oscar nominations came for his performances in 1997's The Apostle, 1998 legal drama A Civil Action and 2014's The Judge.In The Apostle, which he also wrote and directed, the actor played an evangelical preacher who begins a new life in Louisiana after committing a crime.In real life, Duvall attended church regularly during his childhood but was reluctant to discuss his faith, merely disclosing he had \"always been a believer\".The staunch Republican was less reticent about his political persuasions and was a guest at President George W Bush's inauguration in 2001.Duvall's other many screen roles included an LA police office in Colors, an astronaut in Deep Impact, and a Nascar crew chief in Days of Thunder alongside Tom Cruise.He was reunited with Cruise in 2012's Jack Reacher, in which Duvall played a former soldier turned gun shop owner.Yet Duvall often looked happiest when riding a horse, be it in the acclaimed TV mini-series Lonesome Dove or in the Kevin Costner Western Open Range.\"I think the Western kind of defines us,\" the actor said in 2016. \"The English have Shakespeare; the French, Moliere; the Russians have Chekhov. But the Western is ours.\"His other passions included football, the tango and the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, a city he professed to love \"more than any place else\".\"A young actor once asked me 'What do you do between jobs?'\" he once recalled. \"I said, 'Hobbies, hobbies and more hobbies'. It keeps you off dope.\"Duvall was married and divorced three times and is survived by his fourth wife, the Argentine actress Luciana Pedraza. He did not father any children, commenting in 2003 that it had \"never worked out\".",

He said it was \"a very hard blow\" for the region and for tourism.\"Nature as it created the bow, has taken it back\", he added.Passers-by first noticed the absence of the natural landmark on Sunday morning.Officials have suggested severe weather brought by a storm named Oriana - which has battered southern Italy in recent days - accelerated the rock's erosion, causing its collapse.\"We have lost one of our region's defining characteristics, a symbolic asset,\" Puglia's regional president Antonio Decaro told reporters at the site on Monday.\"Unfortunately, natural processes are often accelerated by meteorological phenomena, such as the tail end of storm Oriana\", he said.Decaro said authorities needed to concentrate on attempting to slow coastal erosion and preserving the coast.The Salento region, where the arch was located, is one of Italy's most popular tourist areas.",

    "body": "Six of Sarah Ferguson's companies winding down58 minutes agoLucy HookerBusiness reporterTim Clayton/Getty ImagesSix companies linked to the former Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, are being wound down, documents filed with Companies House show.Ferguson is the director of all six businesses that are due to be struck off the register in ten days - unless legal cause is shown to prevent it.It is unclear what the firms' activities were, although one is related to public relations and another to retail. None appear to be very commercially active.Their closure comes in the wake of further revelations from the Epstein files which suggest the ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor told the wealthy paedophile how desperate she felt over her financial difficulties.Email exchanges between Ferguson and Epstein indicate she asked for his financial advice over how to deal with her £6m debt pile while he was still in jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing.A spokesperson for the former Duchess of York has been approached for comment.The companies that are set to close are S Phoenix Events, Fergie's Farm, La Luna Investments, Solamoon Ltd, Philanthrapreneur Ltd and Planet Partners Productions Ltd, none of which have any public profile.Listings for five of the six companies state there is an \"application to strike the company off the register\". That means the company will stop trading and will cease to exist.The sixth, S Pheonix Events, which also notes the receipt of an application to strike off, lists Sarah Ferguson as the person authenticating the application on behalf of the company.Ferguson is listed as an active director for three other businesses registered with Companies House: Ginger and Moss, set up as a lifestyle brand to sell tea, jewellery and housewares, a \"motion picture production activities\" business called Coat, and Librasol, classified under \"artistic creation\" on the official register for private companies.All the companies being dissolved were set up more than a decade ago. Most are classed as \"dormant companies\", with very little or no reported recent commercial activity.Ferguson is the sole remaining director for all of them.Late last year, documents show she submitted an official change to her details for all the firms from Sarah Duchess of York to Sarah Margaret Ferguson.There have been reports of Ferguson's financial difficulties for many years, but the publication of the files of Jeffrey Epstein's correspondence has laid bare how much pressure she was under.One of the files suggests she told Epstein she was about to \"freak with exhaustion\" at a time when he was still in custody in Florida and that she also leaned on him for emotional support.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJaroslav LukivPAMore than 195,000 people had been expected to attend Taylor Swift's three concerts in Vienna in 2024An Austrian man has been charged with terrorism and other offences over a plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna in August 2024.Prosecutors said the 21-year-old suspect, identified only as Beran A, was accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation, making explosives and attempting to purchase weapons illegally.He is also said to have been disseminating propaganda for the jihadist group Islamic State. He faces up to 20 years in jail if convicted.  AFP via Getty ImagesThree suspects - including Beran A - were arrested in 2024 just before Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna in 2024Overall, three people - including Beran A - were arrested in 2024. They were all teenagers at the time.The charges against Beran A, who is the main suspect in the case, were announced on Monday by the Vienna prosecutor's office. According to the indictment, he had received online instructions and worked to make a shrapnel bomb using the explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP).The type of shrapnel bomb was \"specific to IS attacks\", the statement said.He is also believed to have sought advice from IS members on how to carry out a bomb attack.Beran A has not commented on the latest developments.The US foreign intelligence service said back in 2024 that the plotters had hoped to kill a large number of concert-goers.Investigators alleged Beran A had also planned to carry out an earlier attack in Dubai in March 2024.Reports at the time suggested it was part of a co-ordinated plot involving three simultaneous IS attacks but he had changed his mind at the last minute.\"But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives,\" she added.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRichard WheelerPolitical reporterGetty ImagesThe government has abandoned plans to delay 30 council elections in England, following advice this could be unlawful.Local Government Secretary Steve Reed had approved delays for the ballots until 2027, arguing some councils were worried about the cost of running elections for authorities which are due to be abolished in a major reorganisation of local government.Reform UK had launched a legal challenge against the plans to delay May's elections, which was due to be heard in the High Court on Thursday.The move was welcomed by opposition parties, who had branded the delays undemocratic.Reform leader Nigel Farage, writing on X, said: \"We took this Labour government to court and won.\"In collusion with the Tories, Keir Starmer tried to stop 4.6 million people voting on May 7th. Only Reform UK fights for democracy.\"Asked by BBC London if Reed should resign, Farage said \"if a government minister does something illegal, they really ought to resign\".His remarks came after he claimed the decision to approve the election delays was \"clearly unlawful\".The government has agreed to pay Reform's legal costs relating to the proceedings, which a party source said would be at least £100,000.In a letter to council leaders, Reed said the government had written to the High Court to confirm he had decided to withdraw the original decision. The statement said: \"The secretary (of) state invited the housing minister, who was not involved in the initial decision-making, to reconsider the position afresh on a very urgent basis recognising the pressing timescales involved. \"The housing minister has decided that the elections should proceed in May 2026.\"Reed said he recognised that many of the councils undergoing reorganisation \"voiced genuine concerns about the pressure they are under\" as part of the reforms.He added that the government would provide an extra £63m to the 21 areas affected.The proposed reforms to local government would replace the two-tier system of district and county councils that exists in many parts of England with new unitary authorities responsible for delivering all councils services in their area.There were originally 136 local elections across England that were scheduled for May.Of these, 63 were eligible to request a postponement due to local government reorganisation, and in January it was announced that 30 would be delayed.Polls in five of these areas had already been delayed from May 2025.The government had previously said some councils were concerned about their capacity to run the polls in May alongside the overhaul of town halls, as well as the cost to taxpayers of holding elections for councils that are due to be abolished.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \"Following legal advice, the government has withdrawn its original decision to postpone 30 local elections in May.\"Providing certainty to councils about their local elections is now the most crucial thing and all local elections will now go ahead in May 2026.\"'Humiliating U-turn'Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said his party \"fought tooth and nail to stop this stitch-up and the government has been forced into a humiliating U-turn\". He added: \"We cannot allow the government to cancel elections on a whim ever again. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch said it was \"predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions\".She said her party had opposed the \"unnecessary cancellations at every opportunity\", writing on X: \"This is the right decision.\"A one-year delay to allow new councils to be re-organised is one thing. Two years was always too much.\"The Conservatives have written to Reed asking him to publish the evidence base on which the original decision to cancel elections was made.Shadow local government secretary Sir James Cleverly said Reed should resign if he is \"unable or unwilling\" to answer the 10 questions asked of him by the Opposition about decisions on local elections.Green Party leader Zack Polanski said he was \"pleased the government has done another U-turn\", describing the attempt to delay elections as \"part of a disturbing authoritarian trend of this caretaker prime minister\".Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, said teams involved in organising elections have \"lost months of essential planning time\" and \"face an uphill struggle to catch up to where they should be\".Out of the councils that had originally been given permission to delay their elections, 15 were Labour-controlled, while four were led by the Conservatives, one by the Liberal Democrats and 10 were under no overall control.Here is the full list of councils where elections were due to be postponed but will now take place: Adur District CouncilBasildon Borough CouncilBlackburn with Darwen CouncilBurnley Borough CouncilCannock Chase District CouncilCheltenham Borough CouncilChorley Borough CouncilCity of Lincoln CouncilCrawley Borough CouncilEast Sussex County CouncilExeter City CouncilHarlow District CouncilHastings Borough CouncilHyndburn Borough CouncilIpswich Borough CouncilNorfolk County CouncilNorwich City CouncilPendle Borough CouncilPeterborough City CouncilPreston City CouncilRedditch Borough CouncilRugby Borough CouncilStevenage Borough CouncilSuffolk County CouncilTamworth Borough CouncilThurrock CouncilWelwyn Hatfield Borough CouncilWest Lancashire Borough CouncilWest Sussex County CouncilWorthing Borough CouncilPHOTO ID: What documents do you need to vote?COUNCIL TAX: How to check if you're in the right band",

    "body": "1 hour agoTom BennettReutersMany have been held in Roj camp for nearly seven years, since IS lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019A group of 34 Australian women and children who have been held in a camp in northern Syria for nearly seven years due to their links to the Islamic State (IS) group were released on Monday to head home, but then returned to the camp for \"technical reasons\".The group - thought by authorities to be the wives and children of IS fighters - have been stuck in Roj detention camp until now, with the Australian government refusing to officially repatriate them.It is unclear why their release was halted, but Australian media has reported it may have been due to a failure to coordinate the correct permissions between the factions governing the region. Their future - and that of thousands of other IS relatives in Syria - remains unclear. Other foreign governments have also refused to repatriate their citizens.Reuters news agency quoted a co-director of Roj camp as saying that the 34 Australians had been handed over to members of their families who had travelled to Syria for their release, and had boarded minibuses to travel to Damascus with a military escort.Australian media reported that the group were intending to continue their journey to Beirut, where they hoped to be issued passports. The Australian government has repeatedly said it would not repatriate people from Syria and said those who returned who had committed crimes would be \"met with the full force of the law\".But it has previously taken the position that it is obliged to issue passports to citizens who present themselves at an Australian embassy.ReutersThe camp is also thought to be home to Shamima Begum Roj is home to more than 2,000 others from 40 different nationalities - mainly women and children - who have been held there since IS was driven from its final foothold in Syria in 2019.Among them is thought to be Shamima Begum, who was stripped of her British citizenship in 2019 on national security grounds.Speaking to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the camp's director, Hakmiyeh Ibrahim said: \"My message is not only to Australia but to all countries: take your citizens, take these children and women\". She added that children were growing up surrounded by \"dangerous ideas and ideologies\" in the camp.\"We brought families of ISIS-affiliated women and children here in 2017 and now it's 2026,\" she said. \"The more time passes, the more complicated the situation becomes.\"The Australian government said in a statement: \"Our security agencies have been monitoring - and continue to monitor - the situation in Syria to ensure they are prepared for any Australians seeking to return to Australia\".\"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law.\"The safety of Australians and the protection of Australia's national interests remain the overriding priority.\"Last month the UK home secretary said she would \"robustly defend\" the decision to remove Shamima Begum's citizenship, according to a government source.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called for an investigation, but the government source said the decision had already been upheld by UK courts.Ms Begum was 15 when she travelled from east London to the Middle East, to a territory held by the Islamic State group, where she married a fighter.",

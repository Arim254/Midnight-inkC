    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he is ordering a \"a total and complete\" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers going into and out of Venezuela.In a post on Truth Social, he accused Venezuela of stealing US assets, such as oil and land, and of \"Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking\". \"Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" he added.His post came a week after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela – a move that marked a sharp escalation Washington's pressure campaign against Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro's government.In the post, the US president said Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it will \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\". Trump also accused Maduro's government of using stolen oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". Venezuela has not yet responded to Trump's latest remarks. The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling and since September the US military has killed at least 90 people in strikes on boats it has alleged were carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. In recent months, the US has also moved warships into the region. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

    "body": "10 hours agoLaura GozziFootage supplied by the team of scientists show the scale of the footprints and a recreation of how they were formedThousands of dinosaur footprints dating back 210 million years have been found in a national park in northern Italy.The footprints - some of which are up to 40cm (15in) in diameter - are aligned in parallel rows, and many show clear traces of toes and claws. It is thought the dinosaurs were prosauropods - herbivores with long necks, small heads and sharp claws. \"I never would have imagined I'd come across such a spectacular discovery in the region where I live,\" said Milan-based paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso.Illustrazione di Fabio Manucci, Arch. PaleoStelvioArtist's rendition of a herd of prosauropods walking across a muddy plain during low tide. Smaller footprints suggest the herd also included young specimensLast September a photographer spotted the footprints stretching hundreds of metres on a vertical mountain wall in the Stelvio national park, north-east of Milan.In the Triassic period - between about 250 and 201 million years ago - the wall was a tidal flat, which later became part of the Alpine chain.\"This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure,\" Mr Dal Sasso said.The herds moved in harmony, he added, \"and there are also traces of more complex behaviours, like groups of animals gathering in a circle, perhaps for the purposes of defence.\"The prosauropods, which could be up to 10m (33ft) long,  walked on two legs but in some cases handprints were found in front of footprints, indicating that they probably stopped and rested their forelimbs on the ground.Elio Della Ferrera, Arch. PaleoStelvioPhotographer Elio Della Ferrera snapped the first picture of the mountain wall showing the footprintsElio Della Ferrera, the photographer who discovered the site, said he hoped the discovery would \"spark reflection in all of us, highlighting how little we know about the places we live in: our home, our planet\".According to a press release from the Italian culture ministry, the area is remote and not accessible by paths, so drones and remote sensing technology will be employed instead.The Stelvio national park is located in the Fraele valley by Italy's border with Switzerland, near where the Winter Olympics will take place next year. \"It's as if history itself wanted to pay homage to the greatest global sporting event, combining past and present in a symbolic passing of the baton between nature and sport,\" said the Italian Ministry of Culture.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterThe UK is set to rejoin the Erasmus scheme, the BBC understands, five years after announcing it would end its participation as part of a deal to leave the European Union.Through the scheme the EU provides funding for people to study, train or volunteer in other European countries for up to a year.The UK replaced it with its own Turing scheme in 2021, which funds similar placements worldwide.The government said it would not comment on ongoing talks. Ministers are expected to make an announcement on Wednesday.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had suggested in May that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU.UK students will be able to participate in the Erasmus scheme from January 2027, the BBC understands.Alex Stanley, from the National Union of Students (NUS), said it was \"fantastic that another generation of students will be able to be part of the Erasmus programme\", adding that it would represent a \"huge win for the student movement\".\"Students have been campaigning to rejoin Erasmus from the day we left,\" he said.The Erasmus scheme, named after the Dutch Renaissance theologian, was scrapped in the UK in December 2020, when the government announced its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.Boris Johnson, the then-prime minister, said it was a \"tough decision\" but the scheme had become \"extremely expensive\".He said it would be replaced by the Turing scheme - named after British mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing - which has operated since then.Both schemes are open not just to university students, but also to people doing vocational courses, as well as apprentices and people training at college or school.In 2020, the last year in which the UK participated in Erasmus, the scheme received €144m (£126m) of EU funding for 55,700 people to take part in Erasmus projects overall.The UK sent out 9,900 students and trainees to other countries as part of the scheme that year, while 16,100 came the other way.Glasgow, Bristol and Edinburgh were the three universities to send the most students, with Spain, France and Germany being the most popular destinations for UK students.In the 2024/25 academic year, the Turing scheme had £105m of funding, which paid for 43,200 placements, with 24,000 of those being in higher education, 12,100 in further education and 7,000 in schools.The majority (38,000) of students were from England, with 2,900 from Scotland, 1,000 from Wales and 1,200 from Northern Ireland.Ministers who introduced the Turing scheme in 2021 said it was designed to benefit more people from disadvantaged backgrounds and provide greater support for travel costs than the Erasmus scheme did.It is not yet clear what will happen to the Turing scheme once Erasmus is reintroduced for UK students.Welcoming the news that Erasmus was returning, Liberal Democrat universities spokesman Ian Sollom said it was a \"moment of real opportunity and a clear step towards repairing the disastrous Conservative Brexit deal\".",

    "body": "5 minutes agoMax MatzaandNardine Saad,in Los AngelesProsecutors in Los Angeles have filed murder charges against Nick Reiner over the deaths of his parents, Hollywood director Rob Reiner and his wife Michele.Nick Reiner is facing two counts of first-degree murder with a special circumstance alleging multiple murders, District Attorney Nathan Hochman said.He could be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or the death penalty if found guilty. He will be brought to court to formally face charges and enter a plea after he is medically cleared by prison officials, Mr Hochman said.The charges came two days after the couple were found dead in their home in Brentwood, California, with multiple stab wounds.The charges also include a \"special allegation\" that Reiner used a knife.During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Hochman said no decision had been made about whether prosecutors would seek the death penalty.The suspect, 32, was also accused of using a \"dangerous and deadly weapon, that being a knife\".He was expected to appear before a judge later on Tuesday for an arraignment hearing, where he would have been formally charged. The district attorney later said it would be scheduled for a later date.Rob Reiner directed several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Misery and A Few Good Men.Michele Singer Reiner was an actress, photographer and producer, and the founder of Reiner Light, a photography agency and production company.LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell told the news conference: \"This case is heartbreaking and deeply personal, not only for the Reiner family and their loved ones, but for the entire city.\"\"We extend our deepest condolences to everyone affected by this tragedy.\"During the news conference, officials declined to say how the suspect was located, attributing his arrest to \"good, solid police work\".District Attorney Hochman added that it is too early to say whether any \"mental illness\" played a role in the crime, adding: \"If there is evidence of mental illness, it will appear in court, in whatever details the defence seeks to present.\"",

It's my country. It's a big moment,\" he says.\"My brother who passed away was probably really proud of me, I wish he was there to see my play for Pakistan.\"He would have been the first one in the crowd, my biggest supporter.\"While Umar \"can't remember much\" about his childhood in Peshawar one thing stands out – playing cricket with his two big brothers.\"I will always remember that, especially my brother that I lost,\" he says.\"He and I would always have a competition - of course he would always beat me, he was a really good cricketer.\"Getty ImagesUmar says his surviving brother Ahmad, pictured in 2015, is also an inspiration to himUmar says his surviving brother Ahmad has also inspired him.He says his sibling, who was the president of Oxford University's Union in 2022, is another \"role model\".\"He's pushed me a lot, all of us are proud of him, especially from what he's been through, getting shot in the arm,\" says Umar.Faith has also played a huge part in his journey. \"Even if I'm having a good game or bad game I will pray and thank God, it's good to stay connected to Allah in good or bad times,\" he says.Umar remains determined to continue to excel on the pitch, with hopes for more international appearances.\"In the future you'll see the Pakistani Haaland,\" he says.\"Hopefully get a few more call-ups for Pakistan, be the top goalscorer for Pakistan, that would be a great achievement. Good things are going to come.\"I can just focus on making my family and brother really proud.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "5 hours agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterThe government has ordered an independent review into foreign financial interference in UK politics in response to what it called the \"shocking\" case of Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales. Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).Announcing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\".The review will be led by former senior civil Philip Rycroft and will report back in March. Speaking in the House of Commons, Reed said: \"The facts are clear. A British politician took bribes to further the interests of the Russian regime, a regime which forcefully deported vulnerable Ukrainian children and killed a British citizen on British soil using a deadly nerve agent.\"This conduct is a stain on our democracy. The independent review will work to remove that stain.\"Earlier this year the government published its strategy for \"modern and secure elections\", which Reed said \"will close loopholes that should have been closed long before we entered office\".\"However, in the time since that strategy was published, events have shown that we need to consider whether our firewall is enough,\" he added.He said the findings of the review would inform the government's Election and Democracy Bill, which it plans to publish next year.  The government said the review would conduct an \"in-depth assessment of the current financial rules and safeguards and offer recommendations to further mitigate risks from foreign political interference\".It will also examine whether rules are in place to \"protect our democracy from illicit money from abroad, including cryptocurrencies\".The government described the review as \"a response to the evolving threat posed by political interference to British democracy, including the shocking cases of former MEP Nathan Gill and Christine Lee\".In 2022, MI5 issued a rare warning alleging that Ms Lee was a Chinese agent who infiltrated Parliament and made donations to politicians. Ms Lee has previously said the MI5 alert \"wrongly accused her of knowingly engaging in political interference\" on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.Last month, Gill became the first politician to be jailed under the Bribery Act. He is thought to have received up to £40,000 to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.He was an MEP when he accepted money from Oleg Voloshyn, a man once described by the US government as a \"pawn\" of Russian secret services.Gill was an MEP for UKIP and the Brexit Party, before joining Reform UK, where he served for a brief period as its leader in Wales until May 2021.At the time of Gill's conviction Reform UK said it was glad justice was served, calling his actions \"reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable\".Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Reed replied that the review could look into \"all potential sources of malign foreign financial interference\". Conservative shadow communities minister Paul Holmes also welcomed the review and said all political parties should be consulted during the inquiry.He called for better \"information sharing\" so political parties could more easily be able to \"identify irregular sources\" when accepting donations. Liberal Democrat spokesperson Zöe Franklin expressed concern that \"a small number of extremely wealthy individuals now wield disproportionate influence over British politics - that includes overseas donors\".She urged the government to introduce a cap on political donations. Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies said her party had been \"calling for action in Westminster and the Senedd for months, only to be repeatedly dismissed by this Labour government\".She added: \"Unfortunately, because of the government's delay, there is now no time to implement reforms before the 2026 Senedd elections.\"Asked by reporters if the government was targeting Reform, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"No, this review isn't aimed at any specific party or individual.\"It's about protecting the integrity of our democratic system.\"The spokesman also said the review would focus on contemporary threats and recent cases but it would not consider previous allegations of interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

    "body": "Timothée Chalamet: Susan Boyle is one of the all-time great Brits41 minutes agoColin PatersonEntertainment correspondentReutersChalamet is known for his roles in films such as Dune, Wonka and Call Me By Your NameHollywood star Timothée Chalamet is compiling his list of five Brits who he considers to be all-time greats.\"Lewis Hamilton, David and Victoria,\" he begins, referring to the seven-time Formula One champion and the Beckhams.\"Fakemink,\" he continues, naming the underground London rapper who recently teamed up with EsDeeKid, the anonymous Liverpool drill artist who many have linked to Chalamet.(\"No comment,\" is his reply when pressed on this. \"All will be revealed.\")But Chalamet's final pick of someone who demonstrated British greatness comes totally out of left field.After a long pause and some deep thought, he reveals his answer: \"Susan Boyle.\"Yes, it turns out that one of the biggest movie stars on the planet is an admirer of the 64-year-old former Britain's Got Talent star, who went on to have two US number one albums. \"She dreamt bigger than all of us,\" he explains, without any hint of irony. \"Who wasn't moved by that?\" he says about the 2009 viral clip of the Scottish singer performing I Dreamed A Dream from Les Misérables on the talent show.\"I remember that like it was yesterday,\" the actor says. \"That was like the advent of YouTube, you know.\"Getty ImagesChalamet names the newly knighted Sir David and Victoria Beckham as two of his five great BritonsChalamet, 29, knows a lot about using social media to advance a career. The reason he is selecting great Britons, is due to one of the many ways he has found to promote his new 1950s table tennis film, Marty Supreme. For the last month, he has been presenting jackets bearing the film's title to people he deems as being a great.Honourees so far include swimmer Michael Phelps, NFL legend Tom Brady and Barcelona's Spanish wonder kid Lamine Yamal. Now his promotional tour has taken him to London, where he opened a pop-up store and is now sitting in a hotel bar looking out over Hyde Park. I had asked him which Brits would be worth of receiving a jacket, resulting in the SuBo surprise.  Andrew Yates/AFP via Getty ImagesSusan Boyle \"dreamt bigger than all of us\", says Chalamet Chalamet's frenetically entertaining performance in Marty Supreme has already landed him best actor nominations at both the Golden Globes and the Critics Choice Awards, and the Oscar race is currently seen as a head-to-head between him and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is based on real life post-war table tennis star, Marty Reisman. The semi-fictionalised film version Marty Mauser, however, has some dubious morals, getting involved in a heist and trying to destroy the marriage of his biggest sponsor, who he resents.Despite his questionable on-screen actions, Chalamet is a big fan of his character.\"You know, when you're in your early twenties, you're an idiot,\" he laughs. \"And this movie, in large part, is about being an idiot in your early twenties. \"And if on top of that, you have a passion that you're singular about, you risk looking foolish in addition to being an idiot.\"A24Chalamet stars as table tennis player Marty Mauser in his latest film Marty SupremeMarty Mauser exudes the same confidence that Chalamet demonstrated while collecting his best actor SAG Award this year for playing Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.During his acceptance speech he pontificated: \"I'm really in pursuit of greatness. I know people don't usually talk like that, but I want to be one of the greats,\" before listing Daniel Day Lewis, Marlon Brando, Viola Davis and Michael Jordan, as actors who inspired him. I ask where his confidence comes from. \"You know, it ebbs and flows. And I feel like that's kind of what keeps me on my toes,\" he says, in a far more humble way that he demonstrated on stage at the SAGs, wearing a bright green suit. \"It's my New York mentality insofar as if I'm on a movie or in a social situation, if things are going well, you feel great. And if not, the world's falling apart,\" he says, becoming far more introspective than I had expected.\"And I think increasingly in my life, like as I approach 30 here in a couple weeks, you want to be more on your feet. You want to grow into yourself. But that is a constant learning process. And it's a huge learning curve. And I try not to be too hard on myself or those around me who are also growing.\"Getty ImagesAt the SAG Awards in February, Chalamet said he wanted to be \"one of the greats\"The actor's landmark birthday presents the perfect chance to ask him how he looks back at his twenties, a decade in which he has twice been nominated for best actor at the Oscars, and starred in huge box office hits including Dune and Wonka. A huge smile comes over his face as he says: \"It's been great. You know, it's been awesome. \"I feel like I'm living in a dream. I'm on top of a fancy hotel in London and talking about a film I'm deeply passionate about. \"And, you know, I got to offend somebody from Scotland the second they walked in with my English shirt,\" he jokes, referencing my barely disguised displeasure at his choice of interview garb. Chalamet's dedication to roles is part of his success. He spent five years learning to play the guitar to play Bob Dylan; for Marty Supreme he embarked on seven years of table tennis lessons. \"I got approached with this project in 2018. So that basically gave me six, seven years to prepare on and off. In all my downtime, I would train as much as possible,\" he enthuses.\"I think the responsibility in this movie, like in the Bob Dylan movie, if you were a Dylan fan or a guitar player, that that looks real to you on screen. Similarly here, if you're a ping-pong aficionado, that that looks believable to you.\"His dedication included taking his table tennis table into the desert during Dune and it was oompah-loompah ping-pong between takes on Wonka.And he's already learning skills for film roles way in the future. \"I can't give anything away, but I do have a couple of white rabbits up my sleeve.\"Getty ImagesMarty Supreme also marks Gwyneth Paltrow's first film role for seven yearsOne thing that is totally clear, is his love of the big screen.In the same month that Netflix has announced its intention to buy one of the major film studios, Warner Bros, Marty Supreme is a film which will have a wide cinema release and has not been made for any streaming service. It has been produced by A24, the independent film company behind recent Oscar favourites Moonlight, Past Lives and The Brutalist.\"That is an intense question,\" Chalamet muses after I ask him if he thinks cinemas will actually survive the length of his career.\"I do think with streaming stuff, there's less incentive for these streaming companies to try to put things in theatres, which is dangerous.\"But equally, I do think cinemas will survive and thrive. And that's not to be a false optimist.\"And he wants to play his part.\"I feel like my responsibility as a young actor especially, is less to go, 'Hey, how do we get people to revisit this traditional form?' And rather to go, \"Hey, how do we take this traditional form and bring it to people?\"Chalamet sincerely believes that Marty Supreme will, in its own way, help cinemas be saved.\"This is an original film at a time where a lot of original films aren't made.\"And there's no part of me that's a salesman that's saying this, but I've never been more confident in saying, \"Hey, if you bring yourself to see this movie, you won't be let down. It's really like a slingshot.\"Timothée Chalamet – about to turn 30 and more than ready to channel his inner Susan Boyle and dream his dream.Marty Supreme is released on Boxing Day.",

    "body": "Doctors start five-day strike as hospitals grapple with flu wave27 minutes agoNick Triggle,Health correspondentandJim Reed,Health reporterPA MediaPatients are being told to expect disruption as doctors start their five-day strike in England, with NHS bosses saying they are struggling to keep as many services going as they have done in recent walkouts.NHS England said with a wave of flu placing pressure on hospitals, non-urgent services would be affected by the strike which begins at 07:00 Wednesday.This is the 14th walkout by resident doctors, the new name for junior doctors, in the long-running pay dispute.Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the strike had been timed to inflict most damage on the NHS and put patients at risk, but the British Medical Association said it would work with NHS bosses to ensure patient safety.The strike is being held after the two sides held last-minute talks on Tuesday afternoon. The talks were described as \"constructive\" by the government, but not enough progress had been made to call off the strike.Resident doctors represent nearly half of the doctors working in the NHS. They will walk out of both emergency and non-urgent care with senior doctors drafted in to provide cover.In the two most recent strikes – in July and November – NHS England said it was able to keep the majority of non-urgent operations and treatments, such as hip and knee replacements, going.But NHS England said it expected more disruption this time. Concern has also been expressed that hospitals may struggle to discharge patients in time for Christmas as the doctors who are working concentrate on providing strike cover.Medical director Prof Meghana Pandit said: \"These strikes come at an immensely challenging time for the NHS, with record numbers of patients in hospital with flu for this time of year.\"Staff will come together as they always do, going above and beyond to provide safe care for patients and limit disruption. \"But sadly more patients are likely to feel the impact of this round of strikes than in the previous two – and staff who are covering will not get the Christmas break they deserve with their families.\"Streeting added: \"We have been working right up to today to try and avert these strike actions.\"Everyone knows the period leading up to Christmas and into the New Year are always the busiest for the NHS. With super flu, this year is harder. \"And that double whammy of flu plus strikes means that there is an additional burden now on other NHS staff.\"NHS England said GP practices will continue to be open and urgent and emergency care services will be available for those who need them.But even then there is likely to be some disruption. Cheltenham General Hospital's emergency department  is closing for emergencies during the strike - it will remain open for minor injuries - with patients advised to use nearby Gloucestershire Royal Hospital.NHS England said the public should use 111 online as the first port of call for urgent, but not life-threatening issues during the strike.Patients who need emergency medical care should continue to use 999 or come forward to A&E as normal, it added.The strike is going ahead despite a new offer from the government being made last week, which included increasing the number of speciality training posts and covering out-of-pocket expenses like exam fees.Getting job is 'nightmare'The speciality training jobs, which resident doctors start in year three of their training after completing medical school, have become highly competitive. This year 30,000 applicants went for 10,000 jobs – although some of the applicants were doctors from abroad.Dr Tom Twentyman is one of those who lost out after trying to secure an emergency medicine post. He says finding a job is an \"absolute nightmare\".Since then he has been struggling to find work, juggling a handful of locum shifts each month at the same time as applying for more than 40 short-term contracts at hospitals across the country – one of which he now secured.But this will not count towards his training, so he will now look to reapply next year.\"Some of the job adverts were coming down within two hours of going up after they received 650 applications, which is clearly an enormous number to shortlist,\" he says.On Monday the BMA announced its members had voted to continue with the strike – effectively rejecting the offer in the process – after the union agreed to hold an online poll of members. BMA resident doctor leader Dr Jack Fletcher described it as a \"resounding response\" and said the government needed to go further on jobs as well as pay.Streeting has maintained he will not discuss pay as doctors have received pay rises totalling nearly 30% over the past three years.The BMA argues that, despite the pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.Dr Fletcher added: \"It is well past the time for ministers to come up with a genuinely long-term plan. \"If they can simply provide a clear route to responsibly raise pay over a number of years and enough genuinely new jobs instead of recycled ones, then there need not be any more strikes for the remainder of this government.\"But the BMA said it was committed to ensuring patient safety.\"We will be in close contact with NHS England throughout the strikes to address safety concerns if they arise,\" the union added.",

The ASA said the \"scale of the problem\" was worst now as people feel extra pressure to lose weight as part of New Year resolutions.MedExpress's video advert on Instagram featured a woman taking a selfie in the mirror with text reading: \"I wish I knew sooner that I could lose post-baby weight with a medicated weight loss treatment from MedExpress\".The ASA said it understood the weight-loss medication \"carried safety warnings for people who were breast-feeding\". It said the advert was \"irresponsible\" as it \"perpetuated pressure for them to conform to body image stereotypes\".MedExpress told the BBC that as a result of the ASA ban, it had \"strengthened our internal sign-off processes, introduced additional sensitivity checks, and enhanced advertising governance across all conditions and categories we serve.\"Stigma associated with being a certain sizeAll three adverts appeared on social media platforms including Facebook and TikTok where online sellers seek to gain space in the hugely popular weight-loss jab market which is now worth billions of dollars globally. CheqUp's Facebook advert featured a woman looking in the mirror with the quote: \"I don't want to be skinny, I just don't want to be the biggest person in the room\". Complaints to the ASA said this suggested a stigma associated with being a certain size.\"Furthermore, by showing the model looking into a mirror, the ad emphasised physical appearance rather than health,\" the ASA said.CheqUpThe ASA said this model wasn't necessarily unhealthily overweightThe firm had argued that the advert's text focused on the model not wanting to be \"skinny\", but rather wanting to get to a healthy weight - but the advertising watchdog disagreed, saying the model was not necessarily unhealthily overweight in the first place. CheqUp sells prescription-only weight-loss jabs as well as over-the-counter ones, and says it has a three-minute online consultation with a healthcare professional that tests buyers for suitability. Weight-loss jabs have grown in popularity A spokesperson for the company said it moved quickly to comply with the ASA, had removed the advert and was fully committed to taking an \"ethical approach\" to advertising in the health and wellness space.Weight-loss jabs were originally developed to help patients lose weight to control their diabetes, but soon began to be used for cosmetic purposes. They gained further popularity as celebrities such as Adele, Rebel Wilson, Sharon Osbourne and Tesla-owner Elon Musk were open about the rapid weight loss they've experienced using the jabs.Meanwhile, SkinnyJab's video of its founder talking about weight loss injections was not an educational and informative resource, as the firm had argued, but was in fact an advert and subject to the ASA's regulations. It said the firm could not promote prescription-only medicines to the public in future by, for example, using the term \"SkinnyJab\" in marketing material. The firm said it had removed the advert and was conducting a full review of its branding, terminology and communications.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoGetty ImagesYoung men are behind the growing popularity of nicotine pouches in Great Britain, a study suggests.Around 7.5% of 16 to 24-year-old-men are using the small sachets that fit under the top lip, compared with 1.9% use among young women and 1% among adults overall.Most pouch users - estimated to be around half a million people - also smoke or vape, and a growing number are using them to give up smoking, University College London researchers found.They say research is needed to determine whether the nicotine-filled pouches could help people quit cigarettes, which contain harmful tobacco and other chemicals.The small, white teabag-like pouches are bought in round, brightly-coloured tins. They contain synthetic nicotine rather than tobacco, and young men have told the BBC they can produce a powerful hit.Sales of nicotine pouches have been going up rapidly in recent years, with the rise driven \"almost exclusively\" by young people using them, especially young men, say the researchers.Less than 1% of young men and women were using nicotine pouches in 2022,  increasing to 4% in March 2025.This is due to the \"aggressive and targeted\" way the pouches are marketed, the study says.\"Marketing of nicotine pouches has been heavily targeted at spaces and platforms that disproportionately reach young men, including sponsorship of Formula 1 teams, promotion at music festivals, reports of use among professional footballers, and influencer marketing aimed at male audiences,\" says Dr Harry Tattan-Birch, UCL researcher and study author.Advertising on social media also tends to reach young men more than young women, he adds.In contrast, over the last three years, adult use has remained low and pretty constant.The findings are based on a survey of 127,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales between 2020 and 2025, published in Lancet Public Health.Ban sales to under 18sBut the rules around how the nicotine pouches are marketed is set to change.Legislation passing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - would ban their sale to anyone under 18, restrict how they are advertised, and give powers to regulate the flavours, packaging and nicotine they contain.The study says this new regulation should be looked at carefully so that it doesn't undermine any potential the pouches have to reduce the harms from smokingThe researchers found that nearly three-quarters of current users of nicotine pouches are men, with half under the age of 25.Around 6.5% of attempts to quit smoking in 2025 involved the use of pouches, they said.It's possible they are also being used to cut down or quit vaping, which is more popular than smoking in young people.There was also a rise in their use in places where smoking is banned.\"The key is getting the balance right, discouraging uptake among young people, without making pouches so restricted that people are pushed back towards more harmful products like cigarettes,\" said Dr Tattan-Birch.While they carry fewer health risks than cigarettes and vapes, there are cardiovascular risks for people using pouches with high quantities of nicotine - and there is growing concern over the damage nicotine pouches do to gums.In other countries, the rules on pouches are far more strict. Nicotine pouches are banned in Germany and the Netherlands, and soon to be banned in France.",

    "body": "8 hours agoSarah Turnnidge,West of England andBeth Cruse,West of EnglandA teenage boy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a nine-year-old girl.Avon and Somerset Police said officers were called to Lime Close in the Mead Vale area of Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset, at 18:09 GMT on Monday, where the girl was pronounced dead at the scene. The boy was arrested in nearby Worle at 18:19 and is currently in police custody. House-to-house inquiries are being carried out, with a police cordon in place. Supt Jen Appleford gave a statement on Lime Close on Tuesday afternoon.\"We know the whole of Weston-super-Mare will be distraught and shocked to learn of this utterly dreadful news,\" she said.Supt Appleford said the girl's family had been informed on Monday evening, adding: \"It is impossible for us to adequately put into words the pain and anguish they are feeling right now.\" An investigation is under way, with a post-mortem examination to be carried out. \"Out of respect for the family we'd please ask people not to speculate on the circumstances, or the identities, of those involved because that will only add to their enormous distress,\" Supt Appleford added. Residents said they feel \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" by what has happened.\"I was walking my dogs...I saw the police at the corner and as I glanced down the alleyway I saw some more police,\" said local resident Star Barzey.\"I'm horrified that a young child has been [killed], I mean that is shocking\".Glynis Field, who has lived in the area for 49 years, said: \"I've never seen so many police cars in all my life, and ambulances, armed police.\"To think that's right on our doorstep… It's awful, terrible, absolutely terrible.\"Margaret Jones, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"The chances are that I would have seen her playing out, because a lot of the children round here play out here, it's a horrible thought.\"It saddens me… I find it sad that I may have spoken to her and known her.\"Police have asked the local community to remain \"patient\" as inquiries are carried out at the house and in the surrounding area.There will also be an increased police presence in the streets around the crime scene in the coming days, although Avon and Somerset Police stressed it was not aware of any risk to the wider public.",

    "body": "4 hours agoNoor NanjiCulture reporter andGeorge WrightGetty ImagesVirginia Giuffre, seen here holding a picture of herself as a teenager, took her own life earlier this yearVirginia Giuffre says she feared she might \"die a sex slave\" at the hands of Jeffrey Epstein and his circle, her posthumous memoir reveals. The BBC has obtained a full copy of Nobody's Girl, written by the prominent accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein ahead of its publication on Tuesday, almost six months after she took her own life.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre also says she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, including once with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, has always denied any wrongdoing.The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release date, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Much of the book makes for extremely harrowing reading, as Ms Giuffre details the sadistic abuse that Epstein put her through.She says Epstein subjected her to sadomasochistic sex which caused her \"so much pain that I prayed I would black out\".On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will no longer use his Duke of York title, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.In his statement, he said: \"I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"However the new book, written by Ms Giuffre and ghostwriter Amy Wallace, puts the prince under even more scrutiny.In the memoir, Ms Giuffre says she first met Prince Andrew in March 2001.She writes that Maxwell woke her up and told her it was going to be a \"special day\" and that \"just like Cinderella\" she was going to meet a \"handsome prince\".She says that when she met Prince Andrew later that day, Maxwell told him to guess her age.The prince, who was then 41, \"guessed correctly: seventeen\", Ms Giuffre said. \"My daughters are just a little younger than you,\" she recalls him saying.That night, she says she attended London's Tramp nightclub with Prince Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where she says the prince \"sweated profusely\".In a car on the way back to Maxwell's house afterwards, Ms Giuffre writes that Maxwell told her: \"When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.\"She wrote that back at the house they had sex.\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled - as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she says.\"The next morning, it was clear that Maxwell had conferred with her royal chum because she told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.'\"Ms Giuffre writes that she \"didn't feel so great\", adding: \"Soon, Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy' - a lot of money.\"Ms Giuffre says she had sex for a second time with the prince around a month later at Epstein's townhouse in New York.She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\".She writes that she said in a sworn declaration in 2015 that she was \"around 18\".\"Epstein, Andy, and approximately eight other young girls and I had sex together,\" she says. \"The other girls all appeared to be under the age of 18 and didn't really speak English. \"Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.\"Virginia GiuffreVirginia Giuffre says she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasionsLater in the book, Ms Giuffre touches on her 2022 out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew after she brought a civil case against him.\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" she writes.While Ms Giuffre's alleged interactions with Prince Andrew have been widely reported by the British press, the book's content is wider in scope - littered with sinister details of Epstein's sex trafficking.The girls were required to look \"childlike\", Ms Giuffre says, and her childhood eating disorder was \"only encouraged\" under Epstein's roof.\"In my years with them, they lent me out to scores of wealthy, powerful people,\" she writes.\"I was habitually used and humiliated - and in some instances, choked, beaten, and bloodied.\"I believed that I might die a sex slave.\"Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.On Sunday, the Metropolitan Police said it was \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about Ms Giuffre through his police protection officer (PPO).According to the Mail on Sunday, the prince asked the officer to investigate Ms Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo in February 2011 of her first meeting with the prince.A royal source told the BBC there are currently no plans for the removal of the prince title that Andrew was born with.\"The headlines are taking a lot of oxygen out of the royal room,\" they added, referring to press about Prince Andrew diverting attention away from King Charles's engagements.In 2019, the prince repeatedly told BBC Newsnight that he did not remember meeting Ms Giuffre \"at all\" and that they \"never had any sort of sexual contact.\"Buckingham Palace has not commented.Virginia Giuffre's brother calls on King to strip prince Andrew of 'prince' title",

    "body": "9 hours agoBecky MortonPolitical reporterJeff Overs/BBCGreen Party leader Zack Polanski has defended his party's proposals for a wealth tax as \"tackling the deep inequality in our society\".He told the BBC that at a time when people are \"really struggling\" it was right to focus on the \"super wealthy\".In its general election manifesto last year, the Green Party of England and Wales proposed an annual tax of 1% on assets above £10m and 2% on assets above £1bn.Critics of the idea have said such a tax would penalise savings and investment, while arguing it could encourage wealthy individuals to leave the country.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Polanski suggested a wealth tax could raise between £15bn and £25bn a year.Challenged that other countries which have implemented similar proposals have found they raised much smaller sums, he said: \"Whatever you're going to create from a wealth tax, it's ultimately about reducing inequality. \"This isn't about creating public investment, we can do that anyway, we don't need to tax the wealthy to do that. This is ultimately about tackling the deep inequality in our society.\"However, he admitted the idea was not even \"close to a panacea\" and said capital gains tax - which is charged on profits made from the sale of an asset such as a second home or shares - also needed to brought in line with income tax.\"We need to tax unearned wealth as much as we tax earned income,\" he added.Pressed over whether lower and middle-income earners would also have to contribute more for better public services, Polanski insisted the focus at the moment should be on the wealthiest.But he added: \"Once we start to move to a better footing as a society, where we have better public infrastructure and services, then I think it is legitimate to say paying tax is something that's actually patriotic, we should be proud of contributing to this country, to making sure we have an NHS that works, that we have public transport that works.\"And, yes, everyone will have to pay for that, but ultimately this is about where is the biggest burden, and that should be on the people with the broadest shoulders.\"Polanski was also asked about his position on Nato, after previously suggesting the UK should leave the military alliance.He told the BBC he did not support withdrawing from Nato \"immediately\" as \"the world is in political turmoil, and we need to make sure our country is defended\".However, he added: \"Once we've created an alternative alliance with our European neighbours, we should absolutely be looking at a different way that is focused on peace and diplomacy, rather than on nuclear weapons.\"Polanski was elected as leader of the Green Party of England and Wales last month, beating his opponents, MPs Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, by a huge margin.He campaigned on a platform of \"eco-populism\", arguing the party needed to be bolder and more radical in its approach.The party says its membership has surged by 80% since he took over as leader and now stands at more than 126,000.Polanski said the figures reflected \"growing public frustration with the political status quo and a hunger for genuine alternatives\".The party - which won a record four MPs at last year's general election - claims its membership has now overtaken the Conservatives.The Conservatives do not routinely publish their membership figures. Some 131,680 members were eligible to vote in last year's Tory leadership election but reports suggest the party's membership has fallen to around 123,000 since then.Labour, which is the largest political party in the UK on current publicly available figures, has seen its membership drop to 333,235 at the end of last year.Reform UK did not give a figure for membership in its annual accounts last year, but a ticker on its website says it has more than 260,000 members.Meanwhile, the number of Liberal Democrat members has almost halved in the last five years to 60,000.",

    "body": "6 hours agoIan Aikman andRachel Hagan'An embarrassment': BBC reports at the scene of Louvre robberyThe Louvre Museum in Paris has been forced to close while police investigate a brazen heist which targeted France's priceless crown jewels. Thieves wielding power tools broke into the world's most visited museum in broad daylight, before escaping on scooters with eight extremely valuable items of jewellery. Here is what we know about the crime which has stunned France.Getty ImagesThe robbers reached a first-floor window and cut through glass panes to gain access to the museum's gilded Galerie d'ApollonHow did the theft unfold?The theft happened on Sunday between 09:30 and 09:40 local time, shortly after the museum opened to visitors. Four thieves used a vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine. Pictures from the scene showed a vehicle-mounted ladder leading up to a first-floor window.Two of the thieves cut through glass panes with a battery-powered disc cutter and entered the museum.They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the premises, and stole items from two glass display cases.Getty ImagesThe thieves approached the building from the River Seine banksideThe museum's alarms sounded and staff followed protocol by contacting security forces and protecting visitors, the culture ministry said in a statement.The gang had tried to set fire to their vehicle outside but were prevented by the intervention of a museum staff-member, it added.Culture Minister Rachida Dati told French news outlet TF1 that footage of the theft showed the masked robbers entering \"calmly\" and smashing display cases containing the jewels.No one was injured in the incident, with Dati saying there was \"no violence, very professional\".She described the thieves as seemingly being \"experienced\" with a well-prepared plan to flee on two scooters.Investigators are looking for four suspects and are studying CCTV footage from the escape route.The whole raid happened \"very, very fast\", Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez told France Inter radio, and was over in less than seven minutes.One witness described scenes of \"total panic\" as the museum was evacuated. Later images showed entrances closed off with metal gates.Police and staff ushered confused crowds away from the LouvreWhat was stolenAccording to the authorities, eight items were taken, including diadems, necklaces, ear-rings and brooches. All are from the 19th century, and once belonged to French royalty or imperial rulers.France's ministry of culture said the stolen items were:A tiara and brooch belonging to Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon IIIAn emerald necklace and a pair of emerald earrings from Empress Marie LouiseA tiara, necklace and single earring from the sapphire set that belonged to Queen Marie-Amelie and Queen Hortense  A brooch known as the \"reliquary brooch\"Between them, these pieces are adorned with thousands of diamonds and other precious gemstones.Two more items, including Empress Eugénie's crown, were found near the scene, apparently having been dropped during the escape. The authorities are examining them for damage.Nuñez described the stolen jewels \"priceless\" and \"of immeasurable heritage value\".Louvre MuseumLouvre MuseumThe Marie-Louise necklace and a pair of earrings were among the eight items stolen A tiara worn by the Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III, was takenHave similar thefts happened before?In 1911, an Italian museum employee was able to make off with the Mona Lisa under his coat after lifting the painting - which was then little-known to the public - straight off the wall of a quiet gallery. It was recovered after two years and the culprit later said he was motivated by the belief the Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece belonged in Italy.Fewer chances are taken with the Mona Lisa these days: the painting, perhaps the most renowned in the museum's collection, hangs in a high-security glass compartment.In 1998, the Le Chemin de Sevres - a 19th century painting by Camille Corot - was stolen and has never been found. The incident prompted a massive overhaul of museum security. There has been a recent spate of thefts targeting French museums.Last month, thieves broke into the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges and stole porcelain works reputedly worth €9.5m ($11m / £8.25m).In November 2024, seven items of \"great historic and heritage value\" were stolen from the Cognacq-Jay Museum in the capital. Five were recovered a few days ago.The same month, armed robbers raided the Hieron Museum in Burgundy, firing shots before escaping with millions of pounds worth of 20th century artworks.Louvre crowds evacuate after museum robbery",

    "body": "1 hour agoAndré Rhoden-PaulPA MediaThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) is investigating claims Russian hackers stole hundreds of sensitive military documents and published them on the dark web. The Mail on Sunday first reported the files on the dark web -  an area of internet that can only be accessed through particular software - hold details of eight RAF and Royal Navy bases as well as MoD staff names and emails.Maintenance and construction contractor Dodd Group confirmed it suffered a ransomware incident and it was taking the claims \"extremely seriously\". The MoD said in a statement it was \"actively investigating the claims that information relating to the MoD has been published on the dark web\". \"To safeguard sensitive operational information, we will not comment any further on the details,\" it added in a statement. The Mail on Sunday reported the documents hold information about a number of sensitive RAF and Navy bases, including RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, where the US Air Force's F-35 jets are based.A Dodd Group spokesperson said: \"We can confirm that the Dodd Group recently experienced a ransomware incident whereby an unauthorised third-party gained temporary access to part of our internal systems.\"We took immediate steps to contain the incident, swiftly secure our systems and engaged a specialist IT forensic firm to investigate what happened.\"We are taking these claims extremely seriously and are working hard to validate this.\"The hacks follow a series of high-profile data breaches at the MoD. In August it was revealed thousands of Afghans brought to safety in the UK had their personal data exposed after an MoD sub-contractor suffered a data breach.Last year the personal information of an unknown number of serving UK military personnel was accessed in a significant data breach.

    "body": "21 minutes agoSeveral papers lead with the Metropolitan Police's investigation into media reports that Prince Andrew allegedly used his police protection to try to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre. It allegedly occurred just before the Mail published a photo of the pair's first meeting in February 2011, in what the Sun describes as an order to \"dig dirt\". Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. On Friday, he announced he would give up his royal titles, including the Duke of York.The Daily Mail leads with details on King Charles III's \"threat\" to strip Prince Andrew of his royal titles. The paper cites anonymous sources who say the prince tried to \"dig his heels in\", despite \"the growing tsunami of evidence\" about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. It prompted the King to threaten \"further action\" unless his brother \"saw sense\", the paper reports.The Daily Mirror also leads on the claims that Andrew tried to \"dig up dirt\" on Giuffre, declaring it the \"scandal with no end\". The paper also contains details about the King's intervention, quoting a source who said: \"The scandal has engulfed the family for too long, forcing the King to banish him.\"Calls for Prince Andrew to lose his title lead the Metro, including \"by the family of Virginia Giuffre\". The paper's headline, \"And when he was down, he was down\", alludes to the nursery rhyme \"The Grand Old Duke of York\".The Times also leads with the Metropolitan Police investigation into Prince Andrew's \"bid for police to investigate his accuser\". The newspaper also reports that \"Russian spies and hard-left humanitarian groups are working with people smugglers to flood Europe with illegal migrants\", citing remarks from Bulgaria's interior minister. The i Paper leads with reports on the tensions in Gaza, saying the ceasefire is \"in peril\". It reports the \"fragile sense of calm\" was disrupted by a \"wave of air strikes\" by Israel's military. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"claims it bombed \"terror targets\" in response to an alleged attack on Israeli soldiers in Rafah\", in southern Gaza, the paper says. The IDF and Hamas \"blame each other for breaching ceasefires\", according to the paper.\"Scramble to shore up ceasefire as Israel hits Gaza with deadly raids\", reads the headline on the front page of the Guardian. Two IDF soldiers were killed in a Hamas attack and dozens of Palestinians were killed in \"retaliatory strikes\", the paper reports. The heist at the Louvre in Paris also features on the front page. It reports on the French police's investigation into the brazen seven-minute theft at the museum, which closed on Sunday. The paper says one of the pieces of jewellery stolen was a necklace Napoleon had given to his wife.A \"fractious\" White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky leads the Financial Times. The paper reports the meeting between the two leaders \"descended many times into a \"shouting match\", citing \"people familiar with the matter\". The paper says Trump urged Zelensky to \"surrender the entire Donbas region\" to Russia.The Daily Telegraph also leads with the Trump-Zelensky White House meeting. It says Trump had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly before hosting Zelensky. It describes \"shouting and swearing\" during the Trump-Zelensky meeting, adding: \"Mr Trump threw aside Ukrainian maps of the battlefield.\"The Daily Express leads with an exclusive story, reporting the mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan \"read reports of young girls being raped in hotels by groups of men while publicly denying there were any grooming gangs in the capital\". It quotes whistleblower Maggie Oliver, who told the paper  \"the cases followed 'the same pattern' she had seen with Greater Manchester Police's cover-up of the Rochdale scandal\", where a group of seven men were found guilty of sexually exploiting two teenage girls over five years. \"The mayor and the Metropolitan Police have consistently claimed to have 'no reports' of Rochdale or Rotherham-style rape gangs in the capital\", the paper reports.The Daily Star leads with the British Film Institute (BFI) adding the \"lettuce livestream\" to its national archive, marking three years since Liz Truss resigned as prime minister. The livestream featured a \"plucky 60p Tesco iceberg\", which was \"livestreamed to see if it would outlast Truss's time in No 10 in 2022\". Related Internet Links",

    "body": "World of cricket's farewell to umpire Dickie Bird9 hours agoGrace Wood & Adam LaverYorkshirePA MediaDickie Bird's funeral cortege passes the umpire's statue in BarnsleyCricketing stars from Yorkshire and beyond were among the mourners who gathered to say farewell to legendary umpire Dickie Bird at his funeral earlier.The Barnsley-born son of a miner was 92 when he died \"peacefully at home\" on 22 September, according to Yorkshire County Cricket Club.The service at St Mary's Church in Barnsley was attended by former England cricketers Sir Geoffrey Boycott and Michael Vaughan and was followed by a private family-only cremation and a wake at the town hall.Well-wishers gathered at the statue of Bird on Church Lane where the funeral procession paused for a moment of reflection.Anthony Devlin/PA WireDickie Bird died on 22 September aged 92The invited guests also included Yorkshire chair Colin Graves and former director of cricket Martyn Moxon, the sports commentator John Helm and the ex-sports minister Richard Caborn.Sir Geoffrey and Graves both gave eulogies and a poem by local poet Ian McMillan was read out.Sir Geoffrey made sure the colourful character of his friend of almost 70 years shined through.\"I first met Dickie Bird when I was 15, at the time I was playing cricket for Hemsworth Grammar School,\" Sir Geoffrey said to a packed church.\"He called me Gerald for years.\"He added: \"Surprisingly with all the nerves he had as a batsman, he became a great umpire because he could channel all that nervous energy into good decisions.\"Dickie was refreshingly different. Eccentric but fair. It would be hard to find anyone who didn't like him.\"PA MediaSir Geoffery Boycott paid tribute to his old friend Dickie BirdBird officiated in 66 Tests and 76 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals, between 1973 and 1996.He began as a player, batting for Yorkshire and Leicestershire before an injury cut short his career in 1964.Bird was awarded an MBE in 1986, an OBE in 2012 and the Freedom of Barnsley in 2000.In 2009 he was immortalised by a statue in Barnsley that depicted him raising his index finger to indicate a batsman was out.At Yorkshire's home ground, Headingley, he paid for a balcony outside the dressing room for the players to sit and watch the game. Both the balcony and a clock at the ground bear his name.ReutersDickie Bird retired as an umpire at the age of 65 after a career spanning 30 yearsFormer England and Yorkshire cricketer Ryan Sidebottom said Bird was so committed to Yorkshire cricket that he would be on the pitch even for county matches he wasn't umpiring.He said: \"He'd be out looking at the wicket and wandering around. But it looked like he'd just come in from a night out, like an 1980s John Travolta, because he had the full suit on with a large collar and tie and really fancy suits and flared trousers.\"We used to see him regularly with different suits, some naughty suits, some proper naughty suits.\"Bowler Sidebottom retired in 2017, after taking more than 1,000 career wickets, and he said Bird \"absolutely loved\" the sport.\"Great bloke and a lovely man who would do anything for Yorkshire cricket. He just loved Yorkshire, he was so passionate about the game and Yorkshire in general,\" he said.And it was love for Yorkshire, and its people, that chair of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Colin Graves remembered at his funeral.\"He had a reputation for not being the first at the bar, but he was a very generous man indeed,\" he said, adding that almost 1,000 children had been recipients of grants from him.Among the junior cricketers to have received financial awards from Dickie was Harry Brook - now an England international.Paul Barker/PA WireDickie Bird was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Leeds in 1997Speaking to the BBC when he turned 90 two years ago, Bird said his secret to a long life had been his love of sport and exercise.\"I run, I go out down to the local football ground here in the local park and I lap around the ground. I feel that's done me good.\"I'd like people, elderly people, if they could to just try and do a few exercises, move your arms, run on the spot, it occupies the brain. \"I'll keep my exercises up as long as I can.\"As a young man, he played for Barnsley Cricket Club alongside Boycott and the journalist and broadcaster Sir Michael Parkinson.Dickie Bird shares secret to healthy life at 90Related stories",

    "body": "9 hours agoAna Faguy andKathryn ArmstrongPresident Donald Trump said the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, one of the country's closest South American allies.The US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".His comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.The move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.Trump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when. In September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid. But following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.Under Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September. Petro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack. Posting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".The escalation between Trump and Petro comes on the heels of another attack on a ship in the Caribbean sea. That attack, which happened on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.The Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.  Trump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.",

    "body": "11 hours agoRachel HaganEPAThe Taliban has accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital KabulPakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire\" after more than a week of deadly fighting.The foreign ministry of Qatar, which mediated talks alongside Turkey, said both sides had agreed to establish \"mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability\".Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said ending \"hostile actions\" was \"important\", while Pakistan's foreign minister called the agreement the \"first step in the right direction\".Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties during the clashes, the worst fighting since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of harbouring armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan, which it denies. Clashes intensified along the 1,600-mile (2,574 km) mountainous border that the two countries share after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital Kabul.Rumours had circulated that the blasts in Kabul were a targeted attack on Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of Pakistan's Taliban. In response, the group released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.In the days that followed, Afghan troops fired on Pakistani border posts, prompting Pakistan to respond with mortar fire and drone strikes.At least 17 Afghan civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday.A temporary truce was declared on Wednesday night as delegations met in Doha, but cross-border strikes continued.On Friday, the Taliban said Pakistan had carried out an air strike which killed eight, including three local cricket players.Under the new agreement, the Taliban said it would not \"support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan\", while both sides agreed to refrain from targeting each other's security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure.Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the latest ceasefire meant \"terrorism from Afghanistan on Pakistan's soil will be stopped immediately\", with the two sides set to meet in Istanbul for further talks next week. Pakistan was a major backer of the Taliban after its ouster in 2001 following a US-led invasion. But relations deteriorated after Islamabad accused the group of providing a safe haven to the Pakistan Taliban, which has launched an armed insurgence against government forces.The group has carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the past year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",

    "body": "George Santos is done with politics for now - instead, he wants to use his newfound freedom to make prisons more humane, he told The Washington Post. The disgraced Republican US Representative from New York was released from prison on Friday after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. \"There is nothing more that I want to do than to focus and dedicate my entire life to prison reform,\" Santos said in a Saturday interview with the Post. Santos, who was booted from Congress in 2023 after a damning ethics report, told the Post that his experience in federal prison was \"dehumanising\" and \"humbling\".Santos had admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported.He embellished much about his biography in the run-up to his election to Congress in 2022.In the 84 days he served in prison, Santos wrote a handful of columns published on The South Shore Press' website. He has described the prison system as \"broken\" with \"rotting facilities, and administrators who seem incapable or unwilling to correct it\". He said a gaping hole in the ceiling exposed \"thick black mold\" underneath, and that broken air conditioning forced prisoners to endure sweltering heat.  \"The building itself is hardly fit for long-term habitation: sheet metal walls, shoddy construction, the look and feel of a temporary warehouse rather than a permanent facility,\" Santos wrote.Santos told the Post that he spoke with Trump on Saturday and informed the president of his mission to get involved in prison reform and to \"help his administration achieve that in whichever way I can\".It's not clear how exactly Santos intends to work on prison reform, and his lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BBC.Santos told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday that he's not interested in running for office again just yet, at least for the next decade.\"I'm all politicked out,\" he told Bash. The Bureau of Prisons responded to a request for comment from BBC saying that it could not answer media inquiries due to the ongoing government shutdown. A contact for the prison Santos was held in, FCI Fairton in New Jersey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Santos' allegations of poor conditions and mistreatment. ",

    "body": "The Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was cancelled before kick-off on Sunday, after what police described as \"public disorder and violent riots\".\"Dozens of smoke grenades and pyrotechnic devices were thrown,\" Israeli police posted on X, adding \"this is not a football game, this is disorder and serious violence\".Twelve civilians and three officers were injured, police said, while nine people were arrested and 16 detained for questioning.The unrest comes just days after officials in the UK said that Maccabi Tel Aviv fans should not be allowed to attend the Europa League match at Aston Villa in England next month because of safety concerns.Hapoel Tel Aviv criticised the derby cancellation, accusing Israeli police of \"preparing for a war, not a sporting event\", including during discussions in the lead-up to the highly-anticipated match.\"The shocking events outside the stadium and following the reckless and scandalous decision not to hold the match only demonstrate that the Israel Police has taken control of the sport,\" Hapoel Tel Aviv said in a statement on X, external. Maccabi Tel Aviv has not yet commented, except to confirm the match was cancelled.The decision by Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) to ban Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from the Aston Villa match on 6 November has sparked widespread criticism.The UK government has since said it is working to overturn the ban and exploring what additional resources might be required to ensure the fixture can be hosted safely.Villa told their matchday stewards that they did not have to work at the game, saying they understood that some \"may have concerns\".On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it supported the ban and classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on intelligence and previous incidents.That included \"violent clashes and hate-crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam in November 2024, when more than 60 people were arrested.There have been protests at various sporting events over the war in Gaza, including when Israel played Norway and Italy in recent football World Cup qualifiers.",

But Cate Blanchett has taken an unexpected diversion from her day job - to immerse herself in the world of the humble seed.Her eyes light up as she enthuses about the banksia species from her native Australia.\"It's quite a brutal looking seed pod that only releases its seed in extremely high temperatures,\" she tells us.\"It does look like a cross between a mallet and a toilet brush. So they're not always pretty, but yet what comes out of them is so spectacular.\"RBG KewAustralia's banksia seed pods explode open after being exposed to fire We meet her at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank (MSB) at Wakehurst botanic garden in Sussex. She lives locally and teamed up with the project as it celebrates its 25th anniversary.\"Really, I stumbled upon Wakehurst. I was just in awe of the landscape and I always feel regenerated by being in the natural world,\" she says.\"And then I discovered the seed bank, and I literally had my mind blown by the work that goes on here… and I thought, anything I can do to be connected to it - I found it so inspiring.\"The MSB is home to more than 2.5 billion seeds collected from 40,000 wild plant species around the world.The seeds, which come in every shape, size and colour, are carefully processed, dried and then stored in freezers at a chilly -20C.RBG KewCate Blanchett and a team from Kew met The King to talk about the seed bankThe conservation project was opened by The King  - then the Prince of Wales - in 2000. He's taken part in a special episode of a Kew podcast about the project called Unearthed: The Need For Seeds with Cate Blanchett.In the recording he talks about his concerns that many plant species are being lost.\"I know  how  absolutely  critical  it all is, and  the  destruction  of  rainforests,  the  extinction  of  endless  species,  which  have  very  likely  remarkable  properties,\" he tells the podcast.When the seed bank first opened, it was seen as a doomsday vault - a back-up store of seeds to safeguard wild plants from extinction.But 25 years on, the collection is being used for a different purpose: to restore environments that are under threat.Tony Jolliffe/BBC NewsThe MSB has more than 2.5bn seeds - including these blue Ravenala agathea seeds\"We want those seeds to be back out in the landscape,\" explained Dr Elinor Breman from the MSB, who's been showing Cate Blanchett the team's work.\"We're just providing a safe space for them until we can get them back out into a habitat where they can thrive and survive.\"This includes projects like one taking place on the South Downs. A special mix of seeds from the MSB are being sewn to help restore the rare chalk grasslands there.And this restoration work is being repeated around the world.\"We've been to every kind of habitat, from sea level to about 5,000m, and from pole to pole - literally,\" explained Dr Breman. \"And we're involved in restoring tropical forest, dry deciduous forest, grassland, steppe - you name it - we're trying to help people put those plants back in place.\"Kevin Church/BBC NewsSeeds from the seedbank are being used on the South Downs in SussexThe seed bank also helped to restore plants after intense wildfires swept across Australia in 2019. Cate Blanchett says this meant a lot to her.\"There are almost 9,000 species of Australian plant that are stored [at the MSB].  And we know that bushfires are getting increasingly more intense. And it's sad to say - but knowing that insurance policy exists, is of great solace to me.\"Working as an ambassador for Wakehurst has meant that the actor has had a chance to get hands on with the seeds.\"Have I got dirt under my fingernails? Well, I'm trying to turn my brown thumbs green,\" she laughs.\"You know, living in Sussex, you can't not but become a passionate gardener. So I've had a lot of questions about how one stores seeds as a lay person, and I've learned a lot about that. My seed management has definitely, definitely improved.\"And after spending so much time with the researchers at the MSB, is she at all tempted to swap the film set for the lab?\"I wish I had the skill - maybe I could play a scientist,\" she laughs.Cate Blanchett describes the seed bank as the UK's best kept secret - and believes that over the next 25 years its work will continue to grow in importance.\"You often think, where are the good news stories? And we're actually sitting inside one,\" she tells us.\"You come here, you visit the seed bank, you walk through such a biodiverse landscape, and you leave uplifted. You know change is possible and it's happening.\"",

    "body": "10 hours agoBorn Free/PA MediaThe penguins arrived in May 2011 from Edinburgh ZooAnimal welfare campaigners have called for the release of 15 penguins \"trapped in a basement without sunlight or fresh air\" in a demonstration held at the London Aquarium.Organised by Freedom For Animals with support from Born Free and The Express newspaper, between 250 and 300 people protested against the captivity of 15 gentoo penguins at the riverside attraction in Westminster.The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, opened its first penguin exhibit in May 2011, introducing 10 gentoo penguins from Edinburgh Zoo.A spokesperson for the Sea Life London Aquarium said the penguins' habitat was \"designed with help and advice from specialist vets\".'Idiotic'The penguins \"have now endured 14 years in a basement\" equipped with a pool of only six to seven feet (1.8-2.1m) deep, according to campaigners.Former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey dared the new Merlin Entertainments chief executive Fiona Eastwood to \"swap places with the penguins\".He said: \"In fact, if she's prepared to actually spend a month down there with those penguins, I will donate £1,000 of my money to a charity of her choosing.\"There is no reason that they should be benefiting at all from imprisoning 15 birds in the basement of an old council building.\"\"It's idiotic. It's a nonsense, and it's got to stop,\" Sharkey added.Born Free/PA MediaSea Life aquariums contain more than 30,000 sea creatures across the UKMerlin Entertainments is co-run by Blackstone Group, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and Kirkbi, the investment arm of the Lego family.The British theme park giant owns a wide range of attractions across the UK, including Alton Towers, Legoland Windsor, Madame Tussauds, Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures.A spokesperson said the enclosure \"provides an excellent balance of water and land for the penguins which enables them to express their normal behaviours and there is space for them to ensure they have sufficient privacy\".Naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham CBE, who was also at the protest, rejected the venue's claims and called it \"a blight on the reputation of London's attractions\".\"I could get some specialist architects to build you and me a house in an asbestos factory - we wouldn't want to live in it, would we?\" Packham said.Freedom For Animals launched its Free The Fifteen campaign in January 2024, arguing that since gentoo penguins are not classified as an endangered species, there is no justification for breeding and keeping them in captivity.As of this year's stocktake, Sea Life aquariums counted more than 30,000 sea creatures across 11 centres in the UK.",

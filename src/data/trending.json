The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "24 minutes agoGetty ImagesActor James Van Der Beek, best known for his starring role in US teen drama Dawson's Creek, has died aged 48 after being diagnosed with bowel cancer.\"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning,\" his family said in a statement posted to his social media accounts. \"He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace.\"The star was diagnosed with the disease in the latter half of 2023 but only revealed the news in November 2024.The father of six starred in multiple popular shows and films in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including the cult classic Dawson's Creek and Varsity Blues.In an interview with Business Insider, he revealed he started experiencing changes in his bowel movements, a common symptom of bowel cancer. He stopped drinking coffee to see whether that would help before having a screening test.That revealed he had stage three of the disease, which meant it had spread to nearby lymph nodes.Colorectal cancer develops from growths in the colon's inner lining and can spread if not treated, according to the Cleveland Clinic.Bowel cancer: How to check your bowel movementsBowel-cancer rates rising among younger peopleMore men develop this form of cancer than women. Increased screenings have helped detect it early - lowering the number of people who die from colorectal cancer, the clinic notes.Van Der Beek said his \"lowest point\" in treatment was feeling like he was losing core parts of his identity.\"All these beautiful things that I love, and I used to define myself as - a father, a provider, a husband - all that got taken away, or at least paused,\" he said. \"I had to sit there and say, 'Well, what am I?' And it was, 'I'm still worthy of love.'\"Following his own diagnosis, Van Der Beek spent time raising awareness about screening.\"I've learned a lot,\" he told Business Insider. \"If I can save anyone from having to go through this, that's magic.\"Getty ImagesThe cast of Dawson's Creek in 2003 Van Der Beek was one of the most famous faces on TV in the late 1990s and 2000s, starring as Dawson Leery alongside Katie Holmes in the hit TV show Dawson's Creek, which ran from 1998 to 2003.He also starred in the 1999 coming-of-age film Varsity Blues.He also played a fictionalised version of himself in the cult television show Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, and he performed on the 28th US season of Dancing with the Stars.Van Der Beek has continued working through his diagnosis.Earlier this year, he guest starred in Prime Video college comedy, Overcompensating.The reunion saw the likes of Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson and Busy Philipps performing a live table reading of the show's pilot episode from 1998, joined by Lin-Manuel Miranda who stood in for Van Der Beek.The event raised funds for charity F Cancer and was also a tribute to their castmate.In an interview with ABC News in 2020, Van Der Beek said he was very shy as a child.\"I never wanted to be an actor as a kid. I wanted to be an athlete,\" he said.",

    "body": "2 hours agoGabriela PomeroyReutersA group of women who say they were sexually assaulted by the former Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed have called for their cases to be investigated as human trafficking.The Metropolitan Police is investigating more than five people who may have facilitated Al Fayed in his alleged sexual abuse of hundreds of women and girls. Multiple women have accused Al Fayed, who owned the luxury store between 1985 to 2010, of rape and sexual assault. He died in 2023 aged 94.But the advocacy group No One Above says \"multiple perpetrators\" and facilitators were involved, and they believe the Met's inquiry will fail to uncover the full extent of the network.One member of the group, who said she was assaulted by Al Fayed in 2001, has told the BBC that she believed Al Fayed did not act alone.The woman, who uses the pseudonym Isabella, told the BBC's World at One programme: \"It was the exploitation of over 400 known children and young women over multiple decades across multiple jurisdictions through organised systems and involving multiple perpetrators, facilitators, corporate and institutional structures.\"\"What it is not is one bad man, a handful of helpers and isolated sexual abuse,\" she said.Isabella said the Met has privately confirmed to her that her abuse fits the description of trafficking but cases will not be investigated that way as the Modern Slavery Act was not in force when the crimes were committed.The Met Police have said that some 146 people have come forward so far to report a crime as part of their investigation into Al Fayed.The extent of the businessman's predatory behaviour was brought to light by a BBC documentary and podcast, broadcast in September 2024.Since then, dozens more women have come forward with similar experiences.Isabella added: \"I don't think that what the Met have said they're investigating is reflective of a multi-decade, multi-perpetrator, multi-jurisdictional trafficking organisation.\"The police need to ask the questions of \"who knew, what did they know, when did they know it and why was nothing done,\" she added. \"Only when that has been unpicked can safeguards be put in place to ensure that it doesn't happen again.\"Harrods has said more than 180 survivors of abuse by the former owner are currently \"engaged\" in its compensation scheme, and it has already paid out compensation to more than 50 women.A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Our heartfelt condolences go out to all those affected by this distressing case. The Minister for Safeguarding will be meeting with those impacted and ensure their voices are listened to.\"While we cannot comment on an ongoing investigation, we have declared violence against women and girls as a national emergency. We are deploying the full power of the state in the largest crackdown in British history to halve it within a decade.\"The Metropolitan Police has been approached for comment.",

    "body": "6 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterGetty ImagesOatly can no longer refer to its plant-based drinks as 'oat milk'Plant-based drink maker Oatly has lost a long-running legal battle over its use of the word \"milk\" in its marketing.The Swedish company tried to trademark the slogan \"post-milk generation\" in the UK in 2021 but Dairy UK, the representative body for British dairy farmers, objected.Following rulings in several courts, the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday said Oatly could neither trademark nor use the phrase \"post-milk generation\".The long-running dispute has centred on Dairy UK's argument that, under trademark law, the term \"milk\" can only be used to refer to products that come from an animal.The Supreme Court ruled the phrase \"post-milk generation\" could confuse people over whether Oatly's products are completely milk-free or merely have a low milk content.Oatly's general manager for the UK and Ireland, Bryan Carroll, said the case was \"a way to stifle competition and is not in the interests of the British public\".\"This decision creates unnecessary confusion and an uneven playing field for plant-based products that solely benefits Big Dairy.\"Because the relevant law only applies to food products, Oatly is still allowed to sell t-shirts bearing the slogan \"post-milk generation\" which it had made before the ensuing legal battle.In November 2021, Dairy UK appealed to the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) not to let the company trademark the phrase. The IPO rejected Oatly's application to trademark the phrase.The firm took the decision to the High Court, which ruled that the IPO was wrong to conclude that consumers would be confused by the phrase.But the Court of Appeal ruled in December 2024 that the term \"milk\" can only be used to describe animal products.Following the ruling, Judith Bryans, chief executive of Dairy UK said the body was \"delighted\". The ruling, she said, \"helps ensure that long-established dairy terms continue to carry clear meaning for consumers\".Last year, the EU parliament voted to ban the use of terms such as \"oat milk\" and \"veggie burger\" — but such a ban will not come into force until it is backed by the European Commission and all 27 member states.European farmers have argued such terms mislead consumers and threaten their industry.Environmentalists have said that the ban will harm sustainability efforts and is an overreach by the meat and dairy industries.Richard May, partner at law firm Osborne Clarke, said of the Supreme Court ruling: \"It confirms that, even post-Brexit, the UK will continue to take a strict approach to the use of protected dairy terms, closely aligned with the EU regime.\"The key principle is straightforward: if a product is not derived from animal milk, it cannot be marketed using reserved dairy designations such as 'milk' or 'cheese'.\"Companies like Oatly will now likely limit their use of terms like \"dairy-free\" to \"factual\" information, rather than branding and marketing, May said.",

Rebecca Mundy, deputy chief crown prosecutor, said the CPS had worked closely with Essex Police to examine and review material obtained during previous investigations. \"We have established that there is sufficient evidence to charge 12 people with the offence of manslaughter and that it is in the public interest to pursue criminal proceedings,\" she said. Mundy warned people about the risks of commenting about the case online. \"The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that proceedings against the defendants are now active and that they have a right to a fair trial,\" she said. \"It is vital that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in anyway prejudice these proceedings.\"The 12 men charged with manslaughter are:Greg Allen, 37, of Westcliff-on-Sea, EssexRyan Carter, 30, of HMP The MountJamie Chambers, 33, of Southend-on-Sea, EssexLewis Courtnell, 43, of Leigh-on-Sea, EssexPhilip McGill, 40, of Westcliff-on-Sea, EssexScott Nicholls, 49, of Basildon, EssexMatthew Petchey, 35, of Rochford, EssexRhys Pullen, 29, of Maldon, EssexThomas Randall, 31, of Leigh-on-SeaMichael Shawyer, 40, of Leigh-on-SeaAlexander Woods, 33, of Westcliff-on-SeaJames Woods, 33, of Nawton, YorkDet Supt Stephen Jennings of Essex Police said it was a \"significant milestone in an extremely complicated investigation\".\"Simon's case is one that has evoked a great deal of emotion, but I would ask people to be mindful about commentary to ensure those charged are able to have a fair trial,\" he added.

    "body": "2 hours agoRobert GreenallandGabriela PomeroyTrent ErnstThe shootings have sent shock waves through the small townPeople in the small Canadian town of Tumbler Ridge have reacted with shock and disbelief after nine people were killed and at least 25 wounded in a shooting at a local secondary school and home. Members of the remote community, 415 miles (667 km) northeast of the western city of Vancouver, spoke of their fear and uncertainty during the school lockdown, as no-one appeared to be aware of the magnitude of what was unfolding. They described how close the community of just 2500 people was, and how devastated it would be by what had happened.\"I will know every victim. I've been here 19 years, and we're a small community,\" town mayor Darryl Krakowka told Canadian broadcaster CBC.\"I don't call them residents. I call them family,\" he added. Chris Norbury, a town councillor, was as close as anyone in Tumbler Ridge to the shooting. His wife teaches at the secondary school, his daughter attends the nearby elementary school and he works at the visitor centre just a block away.Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme, he explained how scared and anxious he felt as he waited for news of his wife.He first realised something was wrong when his daughter's school called him to say they were in lockdown. He was able to contact his wife, who was also under lockdown, but by the time he found out  - from an emergency alert - that there was an active shooter, he was unable to contact her again.\"We just had to speculate and jump into social media to see what was going on - there was a lot of speculation... but being who I am I just wanted to stay calm as best I could and wait for the facts,\" Norbury said.That proved far from easy, though.\"It was terrifying, it's hard to put into words the dread and the fear that you feel knowing that a loved one is in danger,\" he said.Meanwhile he was able to see emergency vehicles, including helicopters, coming and going from the school and a nearby medical centre.That feeling of helplessness and of not knowing what was happening was felt by those within the school too.Bryan Castellarin told the BBC his 15-year-old son Ashton was there while the shooting took place.Ashton and his friends were busy studying in their classroom when \"all of a sudden they heard gunshots going off,\" Castellarin said.\"They were huddled in a corner of the classroom for two to three hours. It felt a lot lot longer.Some of the students were \"really freaking out and crying,\" Bryan said. \"My son was trying to console them. He tried to stay as calm as he could, but he is pretty shaken up, and he is scared... He didn't know where the gunshots were coming from.\"Ashton told his dad it was a terrifying experience, and they didn't know what was going on. Luckily he was unharmed, but he is still waiting to hear information about some of his friends.\"I'm just so thankful that I didn't have to bury my kid,\" Bryan said.'Disturbing' photosDarian Quist, a grade 12 student at the school, was in a classroom with a teacher and about 15 students when the lockdown alarm sounded, though he believes he was in a different part of the school from the shooting. He and his classmates stayed there until the police escorted them out.\"For a while I didn't think anything was going on, but once everything was circulating and we realised something was wrong we got tables and barricaded the doors, and I believe we sat in there for two or two-and-a-half hours,\" he told CBC.He said everyone was tense and nervous. People sent him \"disturbing\" photos, he said, with \"blood and things like that\".\"I think that's when it all set in,\" he said.His mother Shelley Quist was working at the local hospital at the time. She said they only found out about the shooter half an hour after the lockdown - though she was on the phone with her son the whole time.\"It's just one of those things when you just think it's never going to happen,\" she said, adding: \"Panic was setting in until I laid eyes on [Darian].\"Norbury said that it wasn't until after 17:00 local time - three-and-a-half hours after the lockdown was first announced - that people started to be released from the school and he was able to find out that his wife was safe.Quist described the departure as \"organised chaos\". \"Professionalism definitely took hold,\" he said.But even then those involved did not know the full extent of what had happened until the casualty figures were revealed.\"A lot of people are shaken up right now, especially when we were told the true numbers,\" Darian Quist said.Though the names of the victims have not yet been released, it is clear the whole town has been deeply affected.Norbury said he believed he may have known some of the children involved.\"I was a children's librarian for 10 years, and knowing that these children that I likely knew, that I likely read to... these are our friends, our friends' children have been injured, lost their life, and we just have to think how to come together as a community and rely upon each other for support,\" he said.He added: \"Crime is incredibly low here, we've never had anything like this before. It's an incredible shock that anything like this could happen. We're such a tight-knit community, we're really like a family here.\"Norbury also reflected on the effect the shooting would have on the community in the future.\"How many people will be afraid to go to school? How many will this affect for the rest of their lives? And it absolutely will, that's my fear,\" he said. \"If I could talk to those people, I'd say, don't let this define you. Please get help when you need help. We are strong and we are resilient and we will get through this\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoJosh ElginWestminster Magistrates' CourtGetty ImagesCharles Brohiri travelled on Govia Thameslink Railway trains between London and Brighton, along with Thameslink services through Hertfordshire and BedfordshireA \"brazen\" rail fare dodger has been fined more than £3,600 after failing to pay for a ticket on over a hundred journeys.Charles Brohiri, 29, travelled without buying a ticket on 112 Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) journeys over a period of nearly two years. He was ordered to pay the unpaid fares and handed a three‑month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Westminster Magistrates' Court.Brohiri, originally from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, but who has been homeless for three years, pleaded guilty to 76 charges of failing to pay for a rail ticket, and was convicted in his absence in August 2024 of a further 36 charges.District Judge Nina Tempia said Brohiri had behaved as though he were \"invincible,\" and showed a sense of \"self-entitlement\" in believing he could evade the rules. The court heard he had continued to travel without a ticket despite being banned last April from entering Thameslink stations as part of his bail conditions.Prosecutor Lyndon Harris told the court there had also been a further 16 alleged offences since his last appearance in court on 15 January, including the day before his sentencing.Judge Tempia, who took the additional alleged offences into consideration, said his \"deliberate and repeated\" behaviour would ordinarily have justified a prison sentence, but she believed probation services could help him address underlying issues.Eleanor Curzon, for the defence, told the court Brohiri \"expressed remorse and regret\" for having continued to travel on the railway, \"particularly the period when he has been appearing before you judge\".When asked why Brohiri had continued offending, Curzon said it was \"a pattern he had gotten himself into\".PA MediaCharles Brohiri arriving at Westminster Magistrates' Court for a previous hearingThe court heard he briefly attended university and had worked as a waiter before becoming homeless and moving to London.Curzon said that Brohiri had been sleeping rough on trains, in hospitals and in libraries.She told the court he had tried to seek help from charities but struggled to engage because of a \"combination of a lack of support, a negative mental health space and not knowing how to go about maintaining support from services\".She added that Brohiri had never acted aggressively when challenged and said his decision to become sober three years ago \"demonstrated his capacity to change\".\"He reiterated to me this morning that if he is given the opportunity to work with probation they can assist him in securing accommodation and employment,\" Curzon continued.\"It is really these two factors which will put an end to Mr Brohiri's offending.\"Brohiri was ordered to pay £3,629 in unpaid rail fares, but he will not be required to cover the prosecution costs, which the court heard totalled £15,120.He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work as well as a rehabilitation activity. He has additionally been banned from travelling on any GTR trains for a year. \"Be under no illusion if you commit any other offences and you do not comply with the requirement on this order you will be back in court,\" the judge warned him.A spokesperson for Govia Thameslink Railway said fare evasion increased costs for passengers and \"diverted public funding away from improving services for passengers\".\"That is unfair both on taxpayers and on the vast majority of passengers who pay for their journeys.\"The operator said stepped‑up enforcement in known trouble spots, along with improved reporting tools for staff, had brought fare evasion on its network to its lowest level since 2022.More on this story",

    "body": "4 hours agoJoshua Nevett,Political reporterandNick Eardley,Political correspondentBBCLabour peer Harriet Harman was among those at the meeting with the prime ministerSenior female Labour parliamentarians have urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to appoint a woman to a new powerful role at the top of government.The prime minister faced calls to name a woman as his first secretary of state - currently a vacant post - during a meeting of female Labour MPs and peers in Parliament.Two women in the room said Sir Keir had agreed to consider the proposal, as well as making tackling misogyny one of his government's missions.Sir Keir attended the packed meeting after Prime Minister's Questions, where Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of running a \"boys' club\" in Downing Street.The prime minister's position was teetering a few days ago and the meeting was another attempt to shore up support among his MPs.He has faced calls to resign over his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US, despite knowing about the peer's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Sir Keir's judgement is also being questioned over the peerage given to former communications chief Lord Doyle, who lost the Labour whip over his links with a convicted sex offender.Both issues came up at PMQs and Sir Keir had to confront them again during the meeting with the Women's Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on Wednesday.The BBC has been told Sir Keir reiterated his apology for the appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US.It is understood Sir Keir said he looked forward to working with the Women's PLP on tackling misogyny and doing more to achieve cultural change.A source in the room said it had been a positive meeting and the prime minister had understood the need to end a \"boys' club\" mentality in No 10.The senior Labour figure described the prime minister as being in \"listening mode\" and described him as a \"feminist ally\" who did not want to \"mansplain\".\"He said he wanted a culture change across government,\" the source said.Labour MP Natalie Fleet, who attended the meeting, said the suggestion of appointing a female first secretary of state was put to him by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman and he had promised to \"take it away\".The first secretary of state is a role which, historically, has had similar standing and functions to that of deputy prime minister, a post currently held by David Lammy.Previous holders of the post of first secretary of state include Dominic Raab, Damian Green and Lord Mandelson, during former Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government.Barbara Castle was the first woman to be appointed first secretary of state, when Harold Wilson was prime minister in the 1960s.Fleet said it would be \"incredible\" if a woman was given that role in Sir Keir's government.The Labour MP for Bolsover said that during the meeting, the prime minister committed to meeting victims of sexual violence.\"There are horrendous things that happened to girls and nobody cares and nobody listens,\" Fleet told reporters outside the meeting room.She said Sir Keir was \"the best bet that we've got\".\"He cares and he is going to deliver,\" Fleet said. \"And it's my job to hold him to account. So this feels like a real opportunity out of the worst possible situation.\"Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who was also at the meeting, said the prime minister has \"the opportunity to prove he has understood the seriousness of the situation\".She was one of the first MPs to call for the prime minister to stand down,  saying his position was untenable.At PMQs, Sir Keir defended his former chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, who resigned at the weekend over his role in pushing for Lord Mandelson to be appointed as ambassador.He said: \"I've accepted responsibility and apologised for the mistakes that I've made.\"The Conservative leader said the prime minister \"likes to claim he cares about violence against women and girls\".Badenoch said: \"The truth is he only cares about the victims when he's trying to save his own skin.\"But Sir Keir defended his government's record on protecting women and girls against violence.A source close to the prime minister rejected suggestions of a \"boys' club\" in Downing Street, saying there were a number of \"highly qualified and capable women that work in Number 10\" including cabinet ministers and special advisers \"across the whole government who are often forgotten in all of this\".",

    "description": "2 hours agoTom SymondsNews correspondent, High CourtReutersFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has told the High Court he \"brought the shutters down\" ",
    "body": "2 hours agoTom SymondsNews correspondent, High CourtReutersFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has told the High Court he \"brought the shutters down\" on any unlawful newsgathering at the paper when he found out about it.He was giving evidence in the privacy trial brought by seven people, including Prince Harry and Sir Elton John, who are suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday - for \"grave breaches of privacy\".In court on Wednesday he accepted there may be evidence private investigators working on behalf of the paper may have used unlawful techniques.Dacre was questioned on his response to an Information Commissioner's Office investigation into investigator Steve Whittamore, who admitted data protection breaches in 2005.The investigation established that Associated Newspapers - the Mail's publisher - had made more use of Whittamore's services than any other newspaper group.Dacre is the current editor-in-chief of DMG Media Ltd, the holding company of ANL. Dacre previously defended the actions of Associated Newspapers at the Leveson Inquiry into press standards 14 years ago. There, he answered questions about the paper's use of private investigators to obtain information, and claimed there was no evidence of phone hacking.At the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, he denied lying during the 2012 inquiry when questioned by the claimants' barrister David Sherborne on stories alleged to have come from hacked phones.Emails between freelance journalist Greg Miskiw and former Mail on Sunday associate editor, Chris Anderson in 2006, were one example shown to the court.Miskiw, who has since passed away, had offered a story about a dispute between the actor Sadie Frost Law and her nanny.His emails included transcripts of voicemails between them, which the court was told, had been made by the phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire, a close associate of Greg Miskiw.In the end, the story was not published by the Mail on Sunday, but Miskiw asked for and was paid £500.Sherborne said this was \"prima facie\" evidence of phone hacking, to which Dacre responded by saying it was only \"evidence\" Miskiw was \"desperately trying to get work out\" of the paper.He added he did not know enough about the circumstances because he was editor of the Mail, not the Sunday newspaper, but suggested that the payment may have been a \"kill fee\" to prevent the story running in another newspaper. The Mail on Sunday was a separate operation to the Daily Mail at the time, but both are published by Associated Newspapers.As editor at the time, Dacre said the \"realisation\" that unlawful activities might have been going on \"snuck up on us\" and so he asked an executive at the paper to look into it.He said that although it was difficult to fully investigate the extent of investigator Whittamore's use by Daily Mail journalists, he \"brought the shutters down\" to end the practice.In 2007, Dacre banned his journalists from using \"inquiry agents\" - another term for private investigators. \"All my energy, all my willpower was going into educating my journalists, educating the industry that the Data Protection Act needed to be taken seriously,\" he said.He admitted his journalists had used \"inquiry agents\" to get ex-directory numbers of people the Daily Mail was writing about, and from whom journalists needed to obtain a response.\"It's very low on the Richter scale of unlawfulness and there may be a public interest,\" he explained.By using inquiry agents, journalists did not have to go to paper archives to look through phone books, the court heard.Dacre rejected suggestions an experienced crime reporter on the Daily Mail, Stephen Wright, had paid private investigators for stories on the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. The court was shown handwritten payment requests submitted by the journalist totalling £1,500 for \"special contacts\" in relation to one story about the case.Far from using unlawful techniques, Wright did \"brilliant work\" which helped bring two of the Lawrence killers to justice, he said.Sherborne asked Dacre if the use of private investigators actually stopped following his ban in April 2007.In a sometimes tetchy exchange, Sherborne put to the former editor that a series of journalists did not obey the ban and continued paying private investigators and freelance journalists for unlawful information.One example quoted by the barrister, showed royal correspondent Rebecca English, receiving the precise aircraft seat number for Chelsy Davy, the then-girlfriend of Prince Harry.Dacre said he was \"totally unaware\" of this, adding: \"When I was a journalist, airlines were very relaxed about giving details.\"It was not a problem for journalists to pay freelance reporters for information, he said, explaining that they were not inquiry agents.\"Every newspaper pays for stories,\" Dacre explained.\"They don't do it willingly. But news does not grow on trees, you have to secure it. As long as you don't pay a policeman it's ok.\"The claimants' barrister, David Sherborne, who has led Prince Harry's series of legal challenges about press standards, has been repeatedly criticised by the judge in the case, Mr Justice Nicklin, for asking questions which went beyond the scope of the legal case. On Tuesday, Sherborne was accused of trying to turn the trial into a public inquiry, and on Wednesday he was given a time limit for cross examining the former Daily Mail editor, who left the witness box shortly after 15:00 GMT.The trial is due to conclude in March. A written judgment is expected to be issued at a later date.",

    "body": "3 hours agoKevin PeacheyCost of living correspondentGetty ImagesAnother 95 branches will be closed by Lloyds Banking Group, as many banks continue to reduce their presence on the High Street.The group said 53 Lloyds, 31 Halifax and 11 Bank of Scotland sites would shut between May this year and March 2027.Lloyds, the biggest banking group in the UK, said it offered a range of options for people to manage their money.The latest announcement is in addition an ongoing closure programme by the bank which will see 49 sites shut by October.Lloyds will have 610 branches remaining once all the announced closures are complete.A spokesperson for Lloyds said: \"Customers want the freedom to bank in the way that works for them and we offer more choice and ways to manage money than ever before.\"More than 21 million customers use Lloyds' apps as their main way to bank, the spokesperson added.Banking apps and an increasing number of services provided remotely have led to less use of branches by customers, and closure programmes across the UK.Banking hubs see banks share premises and serve customers from across the spectrum. A number of new sites have opened, but at a slower rate than the closure of individual bank branches.The full list of Lloyds' branches closing is as follows:Lloyds Bank - AberdareLloyds Bank - AltrinchamLloyds Bank - BirkenheadLloyds Bank - Birmingham, BlackheathLloyds Bank - Birmingham, Bordesley GreenLloyds Bank - Birmingham, Highters HeathLloyds Bank - Birmingham, Upper KingstandingLloyds Bank - BournemouthLloyds Bank - Bristol, FishpondsLloyds Bank - Cardiff, Victoria ParkLloyds Bank - City of London, CheapsideLloyds Bank - ClevedonLloyds Bank - CoalvilleLloyds Bank - CrowboroughLloyds Bank - DaventryLloyds Bank - DidcotLloyds Bank - Ebbw valeLloyds Bank - Golders GreenLloyds Bank - HeswallLloyds Bank - HinckleyLloyds Bank - HoddesdonLloyds Bank - HonitonLloyds Bank - HorncastleLloyds Bank - Hull, Hessle RoadLloyds Bank - Hull, Ings RoadLloyds Bank - KingswinfordLloyds Bank - LancasterLloyds Bank - LlangefniLloyds Bank - London, CamberwellLloyds Bank - London, FitzroviaLloyds Bank - London, London BridgeLloyds Bank - London, StreathamLloyds Bank - London, VictoriaLloyds Bank - London, West EndLloyds Bank - LymingtonLloyds Bank - Moreton-in-MarshLloyds Bank - Newmarket (Suffolk)Lloyds Bank - Norwich, Aylsham RoadLloyds Bank - Reading, WoodleyLloyds Bank - RedhillLloyds Bank - RingwoodLloyds Bank - SevenoaksLloyds Bank - SouthamLloyds Bank - Staines-upon-ThamesLloyds Bank - Stoke-on-Trent, LongtonLloyds Bank - Street (Somerset)Lloyds Bank - Swansea, Winch WenLloyds Bank - TewkesburyLloyds Bank - UttoxeterLloyds Bank - WarehamLloyds Bank - WednesburyLloyds Bank - West ByfleetLloyds Bank - Wolverhampton, TettenhallHalifax - AshingtonHalifax - Ashton-under-LyneHalifax - BillinghamHalifax - Bognor RegisHalifax - BridgendHalifax - Cardiff, RoathHalifax - ChichesterHalifax - ChorleyHalifax - CroydonHalifax - CwmbranHalifax - Doncaster, ArmthorpeHalifax - Ellesmere PortHalifax - GooleHalifax - GreenfordHalifax - HalesowenHalifax - HorshamHalifax - Leeds, BramleyHalifax - Liverpool, Hunts Cross Shopping ParkHalifax - London, HammersmithHalifax - London, PentonvilleHalifax - London, Surrey DocksHalifax - Manchester, DidsburyHalifax - MexboroughHalifax - Nottingham, BeestonHalifax - Nottingham, West BridgfordHalifax - ShipleyHalifax - SkelmersdaleHalifax - SouthgateHalifax - Sutton ColdfieldHalifax - Thornaby-on-TeesHalifax - Torquay, Lymington RoadBank of Scotland - Aberdeen, Bridge Of DonBank of Scotland - BalivanichBank of Scotland - BlairgowrieBank of Scotland - Broughty FerryBank of Scotland - Glasgow, BailliestonBank of Scotland - HaddingtonBank of Scotland - KelsoBank of Scotland - LochgilpheadBank of Scotland - Penicuik, John StreetBank of Scotland - RutherglenBank of Scotland - Stonehaven",

    "body": "5 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterPAWarning: This story contains information some readers may find distressing.Former Strictly Come Dancing professional Robin Windsor slipped \"deeper and deeper into endless depression\" after leaving the show, actress Lisa Riley, a former dance partner, has told his inquest.Windsor, who died at the age of 44 in February 2024, was among the BBC One show's professional competitors from 2010 to 2013.He also appeared in the 2014 and 2015 Christmas specials but could not perform in the 2014 main series because of a back injury and was dropped for the 2015 series.\"It was from this moment, on to the time of his death, he kept slipping deeper and deeper into endless depression. His glow had gone,\" said Riley in a written witness statement that was read to West London Coroner's Court on Wednesday.Money and relationship problems played big parts in his \"darker days\", Riley said.The Emmerdale star recalled how the pair shared \"many, many happy times to begin with and together we did have so much fun\".They were teamed up for the 2012 series, and reprised their partnership in the 2014 Christmas special.\"To say we hit it off was an understatement. We were literally joined at the hip,\" she said.The actress added that she and Windsor built up an \"incredible trust\" and remained friends.\"He literally told me everything,\" she said. \"I trusted him and he trusted me.\"Lisa Riley and Robin Windsor danced together in the 2012 series and the 2014 Christmas specialRiley said Windsor told her of times of \"never feeling good enough\" and \"imposter syndrome\", and that he was insecure about his body and took steroids which, combined with alcohol, would put him in a bad place.One of Windsor's ex-boyfriends, singer and X Factor star Marcus Collins, said in his written statement that the dancer \"deteriorated\" in 2014.\"The day he was informed he was no longer required for Strictly really broke his spirit,\" Collins said, adding that Windsor had subsequently \"struggled to balance his mental health and finances\".From 2016 to 2024, he noted, \"his mental health was pretty compromised and relationships with friends and partners came and went\".Actor Terry Gleed, who appeared alongside Windsor in pantomime in 2023, told the court he felt his co-star was \"obsessed\" with Strictly and would often watch clips of the show.\"He was looking at his phone continuously, and I could feel he really wanted to be there... he missed it dearly,\" Gleed told jurors.Choreographer Scott Coldwell, who worked with Windsor on a live show called Here Come The Boys, said the dancer told him several times that he was \"desperate\" to go back on Strictly.Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden, who was partnered with Windsor on Strictly in 2013, said he \"always did his best to present a bright and sunny face\".\"He always appeared positive and constructive,\" she said, \"but during my time dancing with him he experienced relationship difficulties, breaking off an engagement and feeling alone. I saw him tearful and distracted at times.\"But, Meaden added, other than his back pain, she \"was unaware during our time dancing together of any greater issue\".Windsor, from Ipswich, also partnered Patsy Kensit and Anita Dobson in the main show, and Sara Cox and Alison Hammond in Christmas specials.Earlier this week, the coroner's court heard that Windsor had left a note saying his problems started when he lost his job on Strictly, and referenced struggles with loneliness and relationships, among the triggers for his troubles.Former Strictly executive producer Louise Rainbow told the inquest that three dancers, including Windsor, were dropped ahead of the 2015 series because bosses wanted to refresh up the line-up, according to the Sun.She said he was \"very disappointed\" and \"understandably upset\" when she broke the news, but that his reaction \"wasn't that different\" to the other dancers, and that she has no record of his mental state being brought up in a meeting with him and his agent, the paper reported.She described him as \"a joy to work with\" and a \"lovely man\".The inquest into his death will continue this week.The BBC has been asked for comment.If you are suffering distress or despair and need support, a list of organisations that can help is available at bbc.co.uk/actionline.",

    "body": "Image source, BBC SportThe 2025 Formula 1 Drivers' Championship is heading for a thrilling climax after a dramatic Las Vegas Grand Prix.Lando Norris thought he had extended his championship lead on McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri following his second-placed finish but the pair were disqualified for a technical infringement in the hours after the chequered flag.Norris' lead is now 24 points over Piastri and four-time champion Max Verstappen, the winner in Las Vegas.The Briton will win the title for the first time if he scores two points more than both Piastri and Verstappen in Qatar.The race, at Lusail International Circuit, is the penultimate event on the 2025 calendar, with the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix following from 5-7 December.Before the race at Lusail International Circuit, BBC F1 correspondent Andrew Benson answers your latest questions.It is obvious to everyone that Max Verstappen is the only clear threat to Lando Norris in the championship. Should McLaren pull the plug on Oscar Piastri to focus on Norris, and if they did, when? Or do we watch 2007 repeat itself? - DanNorris leads both Piastri and Verstappen by 24 points heading into the final two races of the season.The only thing that can be stated definitively is that Norris has a significant mathematical advantage, but all three can still win the title.McLaren team principal Andrea Stella did not speak to the media after the Las Vegas Grand Prix, but he has been consistent all year in his insistence about the way the team will approach the championship with both drivers.After the US Grand Prix, he said: \"When it comes to having to make a call as to a driver, this will only be led by mathematics. \"I can recall at least 2007, 2010, in which you go to the last race and it's actually the (driver in) third (place going into the race) that wins the championship. So we're not going to close the door unless this is closed by mathematics.\"That makes redundant any questions as to when McLaren should favour Norris if they were going to, because they have consistently said they won't.But it also says that McLaren are fully aware of the possible scenarios.Stella talks about \"leaning on experience\". Don't forget that he has taken this approach at McLaren after being directly involved in both those years he mentioned.In 2007, he was race engineer to Kimi Raikkonen, as Ferrari were able to slip the Finn between the warring McLaren drivers Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso, despite being 17 points behind under the old system - the equivalent of 43 now - with two races to go.And in 2010, he was engineering Alonso when Ferrari messed up their strategy at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi and lost the title when the Spaniard had started the race 15 points ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who eventually won it.This year is neither 2007 nor 2010. It is a different season with an entirely different set of circumstances, the climax of which has yet to unfold.I find it hard to believe how the driver who had 14 podiums and seven wins in the first 16 races, is now having a real struggle with achieving even fifth place. Is it a case of Oscar Piastri feeling the pressure and leading to a few really costly mistakes, or do the tracks really differ that much throughout the season? - AllegraPiastri's slump in form since he won the Dutch Grand Prix to take his seventh victory of the season in 15 races is indeed remarkable.I actually asked him on media day in Las Vegas whether he knew what had been going on, and this was his answer.\"Austin and Mexico were quite different to the other races that have not gone so successfully,\" he said.\"There, there was a clear pace deficit and something pretty fundamental that just wasn't working.\"The other races have just been a combination of different things going wrong.\"Obviously, Baku (where he crashed three times and jumped the start) was what it was. Singapore from a performance standpoint actually was pretty solid, just the race obviously didn't pan out exactly how I wanted.\"And even Brazil, the pace was good at points. The sprint crash didn't have a great impact on the rest of the weekend. There were some things resulting from that that were suboptimal for the rest of the weekend.\"So from a pace and performance point of view, Brazil was actually quite good, it was just that there were a lot of things that happened that meant the results weren't on the table.\"There was a couple of races where, yes, I needed to do some head scratching and work out what was going on, but the other races that have been tough have just been what some might say is a difficult world of motorsport.\"That's a pretty good summary of what's been going on.But there's another factor to bear in mind, in that Piastri is not driving in isolation. He is also being compared to his rivals, and in particular his team-mate.There is absolutely no question that, after a shaky start to the season, Lando Norris has moved up a gear or two since the summer break.Norris himself says the upward trend started before that - and it seems it began with the introduction of a tweak to the front suspension geometry in Canada aimed at enabling him to better feel the front of the car at the limit.Up until the Dutch Grand Prix, the head-to-head qualifying stats between the McLaren drivers were weighted in Piastri's favour - but in terms of pure pace the margin was only 0.099 seconds.Since Monza, Piastri has out-qualified Norris only once, in Singapore, and the pace gap is 0.226secs in Norris' favour.This has come about through hard, focused work from Norris, as he explained in Las Vegas. It's now up to Piastri to respond.Does the McLaren infringement in Las Vegas really affect performance of the vehicle? - RobThe short answer is yes - that's why the rule is there.The skid blocks inserted into the underbody 'plank' are there to ensure the team cannot run the car lower than the regulations intend.Fundamentally, the lower a Formula 1 car is run to the ground, the more downforce it will produce, and therefore the quicker it will be.Having said that, there is so much complexity to this scenario.The floors of the current cars - which have so-called 'venturi' underbodies that generate downforce through 'ground effect' - were raised between 2022 and 2023 to reduce the likelihood of a phenomenon known as 'porpoising', which blighted a number of teams when the current rules were introduced.This is where a car gets sucked to the ground as the downforce increases at speed to the point that the airflow under the floor 'stalls'.This leads to a sudden reduction in downforce, so the car jumps up, only for the airflow to start working again, the car sucked back down until the same thing recurs.Porpoising happens at a frequency of about 5Hz, leading to the car bouncing up and down rapidly at high speeds. This could be seen on in-car cameras in Las Vegas.Over the past few years, as a consequence of the rule change and improved understanding of the current cars by teams, porpoising has become pretty rare.So it's interesting that it recurred on the McLaren in Las Vegas. And that the car was subsequently found to have worn its skids too much.Porpoising leads to the car hitting the ground more often, especially at the back, so it's hardly a surprise the car was illegal at the end of the race.Inevitably, some will make the connection between the fact that the car was too low, and the return of what McLaren called \"unexpected\" porpoising - ie, was one a consequence of the other?Having said that, it's hard to be definitive in saying that the fact that the car was running low enough to breach the measurements requirements definitely made it faster, especially in the race, because porpoising is not a performance-positive phenomenon.But the rules are black and white. The car either complies or it does not. If it does not, it's illegal and is disqualified. The fact that McLaren insisted it was unintentional, and the FIA agreed, is not relevant.As for the argument one sometimes hears that this is harsh on the drivers because it's not their fault, that's not relevant.It's impossible for the team and driver to be separated - the driver is driving the car, after all, and benefiting from its performance.Are any of the top three drivers in danger of a grid penalty for changing engine, gearbox etc? - DavidTeams never reveal this sort of information ahead of time.Both McLaren drivers and Max Verstappen would incur a grid penalty if they had to change an engine.Verstappen has already had one - he has used five engines in total this season. Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have not - they are on their maximum permitted allocation of four.It's pretty safe to say that none of them will be planning on taking a new engine at this stage, with just two races to go. It would come only in the event of an unexpected problem.Image source, ReutersImage caption, Alex Albon (right) is eighth in the championship, the leading driver not in a McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull or FerrariCarlos Sainz is having a very good second half of the season, seemingly putting Williams team-mate Alex Albon in the shade. Is there a reassessment of either driver's level after this? What is causing Albon's struggles? - EamonSainz is indeed having a good second half of the season, and he has produced two outstanding performances in qualifying in Azerbaijan and Las Vegas, to line up second and third on the grid.But the battle between the Williams drivers remains close, even if there seems to be an odd phenomenon in that when one does well, the other does not, especially when the one doing well is Sainz.It's not fair to say that Sainz is \"putting Albon in the shade\", nor that the British-born Thai is \"struggling\". Not as a definitive statement, anyway.Yes, Sainz qualified third in Las Vegas while Albon crashed. But it was only the race before in Brazil that Sainz qualified last for the sprint, and was beaten by Albon in qualifying for the main race by more than 0.4secs.Over the season, they are having one of the closest team-mate battles in qualifying - it's 14-13 in Sainz's favour on the head-to-head on merit, but the gap between them on average is 0.045secs in Albon's favour.It's also worth saying that Albon is still three places and 25 points ahead of Sainz in the championship, despite those recent strong results from the Spaniard.In short, they are both very high-quality drivers having exactly the sort of team-mate tussle in a midfield team one would expect.Get in touchSend us your question for F1 correspondent Andrew Benson",

    "body": "Media caption, Slot needs to make 'huge decisions' and leave out big players - MurphyByChief football writerWhen Liverpool fans evoke memories of Bill Shankly, it is usually with the warm glow of glories inspired by the father of Anfield, the legendary Scot who built the club into all it stands for today.Liverpool's current head coach Arne Slot drew comparisons with Shankly after the home defeat by Nottingham Forest at Anfield on Saturday - but not in a good way.The 3-0 scoreline was only the second time since April 1965, when Shankly was manager, that Liverpool had lost back-to-back league games by three or more goals, following defeat at Manchester City.This brutally illustrated the scale of the current decline of last season's Premier League champions. It was also a sixth league defeat in seven games, leaving Liverpool 12th, 11 points behind leaders Arsenal.Liverpool's embarrassment was witnessed by chairman Tom Werner, who flew in from the United States to be greeted by a gruesome spectacle that leaves Slot, who masterminded a Premier League title win in his first season, under increasing pressure.So what issues must Slot solve to ease that pressure, and fight off claims that Liverpool spent almost £450m in the summer only to send a successful team into a tailspin?How can Slot fire up struggling Isak and Wirtz?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alexander Isak has scored one goal for Liverpool, while Florian Wirtz has not yet netted for the clubWerner left Anfield on Saturday after watching a display from Alexander Isak that left many questioning what exactly ownership group FSG had bought for their £125m.The Swede was Liverpool's marquee summer signing, acquired from Newcastle United after a prolonged, acrimonious pursuit that included the striker downing tools to get his move.The British record fee came after Liverpool spent £116m on Germany's Florian Wirtz, who is yet to record a goal or assist in the Premier League this season.Wirtz, who has struggled with the Premier League's physical intensity and is yet to look a neat fit either in a role behind Liverpool's striker or out on the left, was out injured against Forest.The pair have undoubted quality, but Slot needs to get them delivering very soon. It is the very least £241m should deliver.It was Isak who brought Liverpool's struggles into sharp relief with an abysmal individual performance against Forest.Isak arrived at Liverpool under-cooked after his Newcastle exile, while a groin injury also stalled his settling-in period but, even taking these factors into consideration, he was alarmingly poor before Slot called time on him after 68 minutes.Isak, who proved his brilliance on Tyneside, was non-existent, his body language defeatist. Lightweight, lethargic, lost.The statistics deliver a damning indictment. Isak had 14 touches, 11 in the first half, only two in the opening 25 minutes.Isak's lack of impact prompted justifiable claims that even the much-maligned and now departed Darwin Nunez would have at least run around a bit in a bid to make things happen.Hugo Ekitike has been the success of Liverpool's summer incomings, but Slot's decision to start with Isak meant the Frenchman was reduced to a substitute's role, playing on the left-flank against Forest when he came on after 55 minutes.Ekitike is Liverpool's top scorer with six this season and has also scored his first goal for France. Selecting Isak ahead of him lacked logic, smacking of a manager groping for answers, almost trying to get an expensive signing to play himself into the team.There is little evidence, so far, that both can play together. At a cost of almost £200m, it looks like one or other must settle for a place on the bench.Ekitike has shown quality. Isak, for now, remains a very costly problem.Should Slot drop Salah?Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Should Mohamed Salah, dejected after Liverpool's 3-0 loss to Nottingham Forest, now be left out by head coach Arne Slot?Former England captain Wayne Rooney said in his latest BBC podcast that Mohamed Salah's place should be in jeopardy.He said: \"If I was Slot, I'd try and make a big decision just so it has an impact on the rest of the team. Salah is not helping them defensively.\"If you're one of the players who they've signed and you're on the bench and you've seen him not running - and again he's a club legend for everything he's done for the club - but if you're on the bench, then what message does that send to you?\"Salah has been criticised for lack of defensive contributions, especially in losses to Chelsea, Brentford and Manchester City.He was, however, one of the few bright lights for Liverpool against Forest, the only player posing a serious threat, although he faded.Slot has dropped Salah to the bench this season, against Galatasaray and Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League, with a loss in Turkey and victory in Germany.He has been below his world-class best, but remains one of Liverpool's potential match-winners. Slot needs all of those he can muster right now.The time for Slot and Liverpool to contemplate life without Salah is when the Africa Cup Of Nations starts in December and he is with Egypt. Not now.Should Slot go back to basics?In Slot's first title-winning season, he showed the surest of touches.Tweaks to the system, such as using Ryan Gravenberch in the number six role after a deal for Martin Zubimendi collapsed, and a more rigid structure worked to perfection after succeeding Jurgen Klopp. Changes from the bench were astute and successful.Slot has not looked the same this term.Liverpool's best wins of the season, two in succession against Aston Villa and Real Madrid, came with Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister setting the platform in midfield, along with Dominik Szoboszlai.This surely gives a signpost to the way forward. Back to title-winning basics.The injection of Wirtz into an advanced role has left Liverpool looking unbalanced and vulnerable, not helped by the German's problems adapting.It has also left Slot's thinking looking muddled.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dominik Szoboszlai has been one of Liverpool's better performers but his influence is lost at right-back.In among Liverpool's strife, Szoboszlai has been one of the better performers - but yet again he was pushed into an unaccustomed right-back role against Forest.Liverpool missed his energy in an insipid midfield as Slot tries to plug a gap at right-back left by Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure and more injuries to Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong.Slot's £70m re-fit at full-back has not worked. Frimpong, when fit, looks more like a wing-back on the right, while on the left Milos Kerkez has struggled.Joe Gomez, experienced and who has played at right-back, was surely an option against Forest that would have allowed Szoboszlai to move into a more influential role.Curtis Jones, who played against Forest, was even used as a right-back by England head coach Thomas Tuchel in the win away to Andorra in June.Slot's substitutions against Forest felt like desperate rolls of the dice, not the game-changers of last season, throwing on Ekitike for defender Ibrahima Konate early in the second half.Again it felt like Slot was struggling for solutions.Liverpool must push for Guehi againLiverpool suffered a blow when a £35m deadline-day deal for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi collapsed.The 25-year-old England international would have served a duel purpose, adding authority alongside captain Virgil van Dijk while providing competition for Konate, whose contract expires at the end of the season.Instead, Liverpool decision to move late cost them, their plight made worse by Konate's dreadful form in a defence that has conceded 20 Premier League goals in 12 games, as opposed to eight in the same period last season.Liverpool have conceded nine league goals from set-pieces - excluding penalties - this season, as many as they did all last season.So Guehi must be a top priority. The problem now is other suitors who may emerge and Guehi can also wait until summer to decide his future.And would Palace sell as they stand ahead of Liverpool in fifth place?",

    "body": "51 minutes agoIan Youngs,Culture reporterandPaul Glynn,Culture reporterPAFather Ted co-creator Graham Linehan has been cleared of harassing a trans activist on social media but convicted of damaging Sophia Brooks' phone.Linehan \"deliberately whacked\" the phone and threw it in the road outside a conference last October, his trial was told.Westminster Magistrates' Court also heard that the Irish comedy writer \"relentlessly\" posted abusive comments about the teenage trans woman on social media.On Tuesday, the judge said Linehan's social media posts did not amount to harassment but found him guilty of criminal damage in relation to the phone. He denied both charges.District Judge Briony Clarke said that while Linehan's posts were \"unattractive, annoying and irritating\", as well as \"deeply unpleasant and even unnecessary\", they were not \"oppressive or unacceptable\" and therefore did not meet the criminal standard for harassment.She also did not find that the complainant, a biological male who identifies as a woman, \"was as 'alarmed and distressed' as they portrayed themself to be by these messages and this course of conduct\".Linehan was fined £500 and ordered to pay costs of £650 and a statutory surcharge of £200.The judge added that it was \"not for the court to pick a side\" on the \"continuing debate about rights of individuals regarding their sex and gender identity\".During his trial, Linehan told the court he believed exposing the tactics of trans activists was in the public interest, and that knocking the phone was a \"reflex response\".He said his life had been \"made hell\" by transgender activists and journalists because of his views about gender identity.",

    "body": "24 minutes agoRuth ComerfordReutersThe prime minister has apologised to a head teacher after leading primary school children in a version of the viral 6-7 dance meme.Sir Keir Starmer visited Welland Academy in Peterborough with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson on Monday to promote the expansion of the free school meals programme.During the visit, Sir Keir was reading with pupils when one pointed out they were on page 67. The prime minister made the juggling hand gesture that accompanies the reference, prompting class-wide hilarity.\"You know children get into trouble for saying that our school,\" a teacher told him afterwards.  \"We are not over that yet, the 6-7, it's still very much a thing.\"As he left the room, Sir Keir told head teacher Jo Anderson it had been a \"bit wild\" in the class, only to be told the dance was banned at the school.He then apologised to the head, insisting: \"I didn't start it, Miss.\"The prime minister uploaded a video of his antics to Instagram, with the caption: \"I think I just got myself put in detention...\"The phrase \"67\", which first gained popularity with Generation Alpha, has gone on to become a viral internet sensation and was even named Dictionary.com's Word of the Year for 2025. The catchy phrase and its accompanying dance has gripped classrooms across the UK, much to the bafflement and annoyance of some parents and teachers.

    "body": "Two climbers have died after falling from New Zealand's highest peak on Aoraki, or  Mount Cook, which is known for its brutal terrain.They were in a group of four that was trying to climb the 3,724m-high summit. The other two were uninjured and rescued by helicopter early on Tuesday, after contacting emergency services the previous night. Hours later they found the bodies of the dead climbers, still connected by the climbing harness. But authorities are working to recover them \"in a challenging alpine environment\".Hikes to the top of Mount Cook, which towers over the Southern Alps running the length of the South Island, are difficult even for experienced climbers because of large crevasses and unpredictable weather.None of the climbers have been publicly identified, but New Zealand media outlet Stuff reported that one of those killed was a well-known,  internationally recognised mountain guide.Nearly a year ago three climbers from the US and Canada disappeared on the mountain. They were eventually declared dead after a multi-day search even though their bodies were never found - authorities say the search was hampered by bad weather.Dozens of people have died trying to make it to the summit of Mount Cook. Hardly a climbing season goes by without at least one fatality, according to the New Zealand alpine club ClimbNZ. ",

    "body": "Are we going to have a white Christmas this year?Image source, Getty ImagesBySarah Keith-LucasLead Weather Presenter As the nights draw in and festive lights are getting strung up, some of us might start to hope - or dream - of seeing some Christmas snowfall.Christmas cards often depict scenes blanketed in snow. While this is a rare sight in much of the UK, a 'white Christmas' is more common than you might think.More than half of all Christmas Days in the UK have seen snow falling somewhere.So, although the odds are technically stacked in favour of a white Christmas, the detailed festive forecast for this year won't be confirmed for a while yet. At this early stage, what do we actually know about the chances of this Christmas being 'white'?What defines a 'white Christmas'?For a Christmas to be officially considered 'white', the snow doesn't need to be 'deep and crisp and even.'In fact, just a single snowflake has to be recorded falling at any point during the 24 hours of 25 December at any of the Met Office's network of around 300 observing stations.The definition has changed over the years and has been broadened to include data from automated weather-recording stations as well as manned or manual sites.Snow already lying on the ground on Christmas Day may make things look merry and bright, but it does not count under the official definition of a white Christmas.When will we know for sure that we'll have a white Christmas?Image caption, In December 2010, the UK experienced very low temperatures and significant snowfalls. Lying snow was reported in many places on Christmas Day It's still too early to know for sure. The festive forecast will become much clearer about five days before Christmas, so keep an eye on the BBC Weather app or website for the latest updates. You can also read our thoughts further ahead in our monthly outlook.Forecasting snow in the UK is notoriously difficult because, as an island nation, it is most frequently influenced by mild Atlantic weather patterns.However, longer-range weather forecasting models are beginning to show possible trends for the Christmas period, influenced by wider teleconnections - large-scale interactions in which weather patterns in distant regions create atmospheric waves and flows that affect conditions thousands of miles away.One such potential influence to our winter weather is a 'warm blob' in the Pacific Ocean which could favour higher pressure and colder conditions developing in Europe.Meteorologists are also keeping an eye on the development of a potential La Niña event over the coming months - the colder phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. Whilst the link between La Niña and UK weather isn't clear cut, the Met Office suggests that historically it promotes high pressure to develop in the Atlantic in early winter.  This could mean a higher than average chance of colder weather to start December.Overall most computer models are hinting at a trend towards slightly calmer and colder conditions developing towards 25 December, so perhaps there's a chance of seeing something white on the big day! When was the last white Christmas in the UK?The last time the UK saw a widespread white Christmas was back in 2010, when snow fell at 19% of weather stations, and very unusually, 83% of stations reported snow lying on the ground.Since 2020, every year except 2024 has officially been a white Christmas. However, in each of these years, very few places reported any snow actually settling on the ground.What are the \"white Christmas\" odds?The chances of festive snowfall vary a lot in different locations, with much better odds the further north and the higher up you venture. The places most likely to get a white Christmas Day are northern and eastern Scotland, northern England, north Wales and the north-west Midlands.Image caption, Christmas Eve snow is now less likely in much of Europe, some parts of the UK have seen an upward trend in recent yearsAs our climate warms, winters in the UK are becoming milder and wetter. A rise in land and sea temperatures has generally reduced the chances of a white Christmas, especially when compared to the 18th and 19th centuries. ",

    "body": "Sugar tax extended to milk-based drinks: What you need to knowJust nowGetty ImagesMilkshakes and lattes are to be included in the government's sugar tax scheme for the first time in the UK in a renewed attempt to help tackle obesity.The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.How will it work?Extending the sugar tax to milk-based drinks is expected to happen from April 2028. The government says companies which make these drinks will have to reduce the sugar they contain or face paying the tax.That means they could either taste different (less sugary) or cost a bit more.The tax was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to make diets healthier and tackle obesity, by cutting sugar intake.What drinks are included?The sugar tax applies to pre-packaged soft drinks with added sugar.It already applies to most sugary and fizzy soft drinks sold in cans, bottles and cartons in supermarkets.It will now also apply to pre-packaged sugary milk-based drinks sold in supermarkets, such as milkshakes and lattes.Milk-based drinks have been exempt from the sugar tax because they contain calcium, which is encouraged in children and young people's diets.However, the high sugar content of some milk-based drinks means the government has removed that exemption.The government has consulted on introducing a 'lactose allowance' to account for the natural sugars in the milk content of these drinks.All milk substitute drinks, such as soya, almond or oat drinks, were previously exempt from the sugar tax if they contained 120mg of calcium per 100ml.But if these drinks contain added sugars beyond those derived from the main ingredient, they will now be taxed.Getty ImagesWhat drinks are not included?The sugar tax does not apply to drinks made and served in cafés, restaurants and bars. So coffees, lattes and other milky drinks made on café premises would not come under this tax.Soft drinks made only with natural sugars, such as cows' milk and pure fruit juice, are also not part of the tax.Alcohol-free beer or wine, infant formula, drinks sold as powder and cocktails or mocktails served in an open container also don't fall within the scope of the sugar tax.How much do companies pay?Currently, the tax is charged at 18p per litre on drinks containing at least 5g of total sugar per 100ml, and 24p per litre on drinks with 8g of sugar or more.But the government has been considering bringing down the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks. Instead of 5g, the limit will now be 4.5g per 100ml. What impact has the sugar tax had?To date, it's led to a 46% reduction in the sugar contained in soft drinks affected, the government says. Nearly 90% of the market now contains less sugar than the level at which the tax applies.But experts say there is still too much sugar in UK diets.Free sugars should account for no more than 5% of daily energy intake, current UK advice says.But the amount of sugar consumed in the UK is around double that. And obesity rates in children and adults show no signs of going down either, with nearly two-thirds of people in the UK overweight or obese.This is what has prompted the government to carry out a review of the tax, and extend it to milk-based drinks.",

    "body": "Adolescence lasts into 30s - new study shows four pivotal ages for your brain2 hours agoJames GallagherHealth and science correspondentMonty Rakusen/GettyThe brain goes through five distinct phases in life, with key turning points at ages nine, 32, 66 and 83, scientists have revealed.Around 4,000 people up to the age of 90 had scans to reveal the connections between their brain cells.Researchers at the University of Cambridge showed that the brain stays in the adolescent phase until our early thirties when we \"peak\".They say the results could help us understand why the risk of mental health disorders and dementia varies through life.The brain is constantly changing in response to new knowledge and experience – but the research shows this is not one smooth pattern from birth to death.Instead, these are the five brain phases:Childhood - from birth to age nineAdolescence - from nine to 32Adulthood - from 32 to 66Early ageing - from 66 to 83Late ageing - from 83 onwards\"The brain rewires across the lifespan. It's always strengthening and weakening connections and it's not one steady pattern - there are fluctuations and phases of brain rewiring,\" Dr Alexa Mousley told the BBC.Some people will reach these landmarks earlier or later than others – but the researchers said it was striking how clearly these ages stood out in the data. These patterns have only now been revealed due to the quantity of brain scans available in the study, which was published in the journal Nature Communications.The five brain phasesChildhood - The first period is when the brain is rapidly increasing in size but also thinning out the overabundance of connections between brain cells, called synapses, created at the start of life.The brain gets less efficient during this stage. It works like a child meandering around a park, going wherever takes their fancy, rather than heading straight from A to B.Adolescence - That changes abruptly from the age of nine when the connections in the brain go through a period of ruthless efficiency. \"It's a huge shift,\" said Dr Mousley, describing the most profound change between brain phases.This is also the time when there is the greatest risk of mental health disorders beginning.Unsurprisingly adolescence starts around the onset of puberty, but this is the latest evidence suggesting it ends much later than we assumed. It was once thought to be confined to the teenage years, before neuroscience suggested it continued into your 20s and now early 30s.This phase is the brain's only period when its network of neurons gets more efficient. Dr Mousely said this backs up many measures of brain function suggesting it peaks in your early thirties, but added it was \"very interesting\" that the brain stays in the same phase between nine and 32.Adulthood - Next comes a period of stability for the brain as it enters its longest era, lasting three decades.Change is slower during this time compared with the fireworks before, but here we see the improvements in brain efficiency flip into reverse.Dr Mousely said this \"aligns with a plateau of intelligence and personality\" that many of us will have witnessed or experienced.Early ageing - This kicks in at 66, but it is not an abrupt and sudden decline. Instead there are shifts in the patterns of connections in the brain.Instead of coordinating as one whole brain, the organ becomes increasingly separated into regions that work tightly together - like band members starting their own solo projects.Although the study looked at healthy brains, this is also the age at which dementia and high blood pressure, which affects brain health, are starting to show.Late ageing - Then, at the age of 83, we enter the final stage. There is less data than for the other groups as finding healthy brains to scan was more challenging. The brain changes are similar to early ageing, but even more pronounced.Dr Mousely said what really surprised her was how well the different \"ages align with a lot of important milestones\" such as puberty, health concerns later in life and even the pretty big social shifts in your early 30s such as parenthood.'A very cool study'The study did not look at men and women separately, but there will be questions such as the impact of menopause.Duncan Astle, professor of neuroinformatics at the University of Cambridge, said: \"Many neurodevelopmental, mental health and neurological conditions are linked to the way the brain is wired. Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory, and a whole host of different behaviours.\"Prof Tara Spires-Jones, director of the centre for discovery brain sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"This is a very cool study highlighting how much our brains change over our lifetimes.\"She said the results \"fit well\" with our understanding of brain ageing, but cautioned \"not everyone will experience these network changes at exactly the same ages\".",

    "body": "11 hours agoNardine Saadin Los Angeles Records about the death of Celeste Rivas Hernandez, a 15-year-old girl whose body was found in singer D4vd's car, have been barred from public release, officials said. The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Ms Rivas Hernandez's death can be released or posted on its website.The police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".Chief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\". \"We are dedicated to serving our community with full transparency; however, the law precludes us from doing so while the court order remains in this case,\" Dr Ukpo added.Police discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded Tesla on 8 September, after responding to reports of a foul odour at a Hollywood tow yard. Rivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.The car, registered to D4vd, had been towed from the Hollywood Hills neighbourhood five days after it had been abandoned. D4vd, 20, whose real name David Anthony Burke, released his debut album in April and was on tour when the remains were discovered. He has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.A police spokesperson said the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division. No arrests have been made. The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, has said they are \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his sophomore album.Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.",

    "body": "53 minutes agoKaty Austin,Transport correspondent andNick Edser,Business reporterHeathrow Airport's plan for a third runway, which involves moving the M25 motorway, has been chosen by the government.Two plans had been under consideration - one from the airport itself, and another from Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora.Heathrow had proposed a new runway which would be up to 3.5km (2.2 miles) long and require a new road tunnel under the airport. The rival bid from Arora Group would have involved a shorter runway at a lower cost, and did not require altering the M25.A final decision on whether a third runway will get the green light is still years away.Last month, the government asked for further information to help choose between the Heathrow and Arora schemes.The Department for Transport said Heathrow's own proposal offered the most deliverable option, and the \"greatest likelihood\" of getting a decision on planning approval within this parliament.The plan that has been backed will inform the government's review of the Airports National Policy Statement.Once that is complete, Heathrow is expected to apply for planning permission. The government then hopes for a decision by 2029.But any company will be able to submit an application to build the new runway and terminals at the site.Heathrow had set out its plans for expansion in the summer. The whole project, which is expected to cost £49bn, includes:the new runway, which Heathrow says will increase capacity to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers a year. It currently serves about 84 milliona new terminal called T5X, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals. It would close Terminal 3enhancement of local rail connections and improvements to Heathrow's bus and coach stationsdiversion of the M25, which would involve a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the motorway between junctions 14-15The Arora Group said it accepted the government's choice, adding it welcomed the decision to leave the option open for other firms to bid for the work.\"It's imperative there is a clear and transparent process for selecting a promoter to ensure it best serves the interests of consumers,\" the group said.Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said Heathrow was the UK's only hub airport that supported trade, tourism and jobs.\"Today is another important step to enable a third runway and build on these benefits, setting the direction for the remainder of our work to get the policy framework in place for airport expansion,\" she said.\"This will allow a decision on a third runway plan this parliament which meets our key tests including on the environment and economic growth.\"The government has already approved a string of other airport expansion plans, including a second runway at Gatwick Airport.However, the Heathrow plans face opposition from environmental groups, politicians, and local residents.Tony Bosworth, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said the plan was \"virtually the equivalent of bolting an airport the size of Gatwick onto Heathrow\".\"That would mean more noise and air pollution for local communities,\" he said.\"Expanding Heathrow simply isn't compatible with our legally binding climate targets, even if the government meets its hugely optimistic assumptions for emerging technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuels.\"In reaching its decision, the government said that Heathrow's runway plan was better developed and, while it required \"major works\" to the M25, the rival Arora scheme would also have had a \"considerable impact\" on the motorway.It added that while the Heathrow proposal requires more land, it involves the acquisition of fewer houses around the airport than Arora's plan.The government also said the longer runway would provide \"greater resilience and potential futureproofing for next-generation aircraft\".A spokesperson for Heathrow welcomed the decision but said it needed \"clarity as to how the crucial next phase of the project will be regulated\".The airport is seeking reassurance that it will be allowed to increase its fees by enough to cover the cost of the planning application, which it says it will have to start very soon to meet the government's timetable.Earlier this month, the chief executive of British Airways, Sean Doyle, told industry members and MPs that Heathrow should be expanded without moving the M25.\"I think we should look at ways of potentially building a shorter runway,\" he said.Some airlines are concerned that the cost of building the third runway will make the airport more expensive for them, and ultimately for customers.",

    "body": "2 hours agoHannah KarpelBBC NewsGetty ImagesWhether you're excited for the seasonal sales or avoiding the shops altogether, it's hard to escape the countless emails and social media adverts on Black Friday deals.The US holiday - which falls this Friday - has been firmly adopted by UK retailers, and what was once a single day of sales now spans the weeks before and after.However eight in 10 deals promoted during this buying bonanza were cheaper or the same price outside of the four-week Black Friday period, according to research from consumer group Which?This suggests shoppers could get the same or a better deal at other times of the year. But if you're planning to buy now, here's how to make sure you bag a bargain.Check it's a real discountSome retailers create the illusion of a big discount by raising prices in the weeks before Black Friday, only to drop them again during the \"sale\".Websites such as PriceRunner or CamelCamelCamel let you look at previous prices so you can work out whether a discount is genuine.For example, according to Price Runner, the cheapest Apple ipad overall was selling online for £309 on the 19 October. By 10 November it had increased to £391.99. When the Black Friday sales launched on 21 November, it was back down to £309.This tactic isn't illegal, but it can easily mislead shoppers into thinking they're getting a far bigger discount than they really are, consumer champion, Rebecca Wilcox told Morning Live.AI can help too, says retail analyst Natalie Berg, host of the Retail Disrupted podcast. \"You can ask ChatGPT: 'Show me the best Black Friday deals for a 10-year-old who loves the movie Wicked.' You don't need to trawl through different sites, which can be time-consuming and overwhelming.\"Getty ImagesDon't wait - keep your receiptShoppers often hold off buying items hoping they'll be cheaper on Black Friday.But none of the 175 products tracked by Which? were at their cheapest price of the year on that day.Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth says: \"There is a huge risk in [holding out], because the products you want to buy may not be available anymore.\"She says higher costs this year means retailers are less likely to have surplus stock.So if you do find the product you're after and it's at a price you're happy with, Shuttleworth recommends buying it - and keeping your receipt. Many retailers will refund the difference if prices fall again. Some companies, like Currys and Argos, offer a Black Friday guarantee.If you do find it cheaper within the returns period you could always take it back it and buy again at the lower price.Stock up on essentials like loo rollDon't just think about big-ticket items. Some of the biggest markdowns are on everyday items such as quilted toilet roll and dishwasher tablets, Kat Cereda from consumer watchdog Which? told the BBC.Start by deciding what you actually need. If you're looking for a specific brand, check their website directly and join their mailing list for early access to their sales. \"The tech is there to help retailers offer more real-time rewards and target their best shoppers,\" says Berg.Don't fall for pressure tactics such as \"selling fast\" or \"only two left\", which can fuel impulse buying, the competiton watchdog warns.And if you're spending over £100, then it recommends using a credit card.\"You have legal protection that means you can claim for a refund if the company goes bust, your item doesn't arrive, or if there are certain other problems such as an item being faulty or not as described,\" says Hayley Fletcher from The Competition and Markets Authority.Getty ImagesDon't rush your purchaseScammers ramp up activity around major events like Black Friday and can take advantage of the urgency shoppers may feel. Fake websites and counterfeit goods often spike during this period, posing as limited-time deals to lure people in.\"If something seems too good to be true or doesn't feel right, it might be a scam. Don't rush your purchase. Research the company you're buying from and be wary of suspicious web links,\" says Jane Parsons, consumer expert at Citizens Advice.This year, TikTok shop has become an increasingly popular destination for Black Friday discounts, with brands such as M&S, L'Oréal and Rituals selling directly on the app. \"You can find flash sales not available on a retailer's site,\" says Berg. \"But it's important to check the accounts you are buying from are verified.\"",

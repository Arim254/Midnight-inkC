    "body": "4 hours agoFrank GardnerSecurity correspondentBBCRussia's full-scale war on Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. Mysterious incidents of so-called \"hybrid warfare\" are mounting in Europe, increasing tensions. And in the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid it. But if the unthinkable happened, and war with Russia broke out, could the UK fight for more than just a few weeks?Listen to Frank reading this article\"We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now.\" So said Russian President Vladimir Putin on 2 December, accusing European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in Ukraine.To be clear, it is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies. But Putin's words were an uncomfortable reminder that a war between Russia and Nato countries, including the UK, was not as remote as people hoped.How war could look in the tech-age\"Well that's odd. I've got no signal on my phone.\" \"Me neither. I'm offline. What's going on?\" That scenario, hypothetically, is just one way we could know that a war with Russia had begun, or was about to. (I should add that there can also be other, perfectly benign, reasons for a loss of signal.)That signal interruption could be followed by an inability to make bank payments for essentials like food and fuel. Food distribution would be disrupted, electricity supplies compromised.AFP via Getty Images'We are not planning to go to war with Europe. But if Europe wants to, and starts, we are ready right now,' Putin has saidThere are many ways of fighting a war, and not just the physically destructive wave of drones, bombs and missiles so tragically familiar to the citizens of Ukraine.Our modern, tech-driven society is highly dependent on the network of undersea cables and pipelines that connect the UK to the rest of the world, carrying data, financial transactions and energy. Covert activity by Russian spy vessels, such as the Yantar, is widely believed to have scoped out these cables for potential sabotage in a time of war, which is why the Royal Navy has recently invested in a fleet of underwater drones equipped with integrated sensors.In a war, these hidden, unseen actions, combined with an almost inevitable attempt to \"blind\" Western satellites in space, would seriously hamper the UK's ability to fight, as well as potentially wreaking havoc on civil society.Getty ImagesIn the UK, military chiefs have warned we must prepare for war if we want to avoid itAt a recent conference in London entitled Fighting the Long War, organised by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank, military and political figures came together to discuss whether the UK's current armed forces would be in a position to sustain a protracted conflict before they ran out of everything from troops, to ammunition to spare parts.\"There remains little evidence that the UK has a plan to fight a war lasting more than a few weeks,\" argues Rusi's Hamish Mundell. \"Medical capacity is limited. Reserve regeneration pipelines are slow… The British plan for mass casualty outcomes appears to be based on not taking casualties.\" With classic British understatement, he says: \"This could be considered an optimistic planning assumption.\"He adds that to fight a long war you need proper back-up. \"It demands a second and even third echelon; personnel, platforms and logistics chains that can absorb losses and continue the fight. Yet this depth is notably absent from current British force design.\"Russia's 'low quality' army\"There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,\" says Justin Crump, CEO of Sibylline, a private intelligence company.Two of the biggest military lessons to come out of the Ukraine war are firstly, that drones are now integral to modern warfare, at every level, and secondly, that \"mass\", or sheer volume of personnel and military hardware, matters.Getty Images'There are shortfalls in ammunition, artillery, vehicles, air defence, and people, with limited to no ability to regenerate units or casualties,' says Justin CrumpRussia's army is generally of a very low quality. Its soldiers are poorly equipped, poorly led and poorly fed. Their life expectancy in the deadly \"drone zone\" of eastern Ukraine is short. UK Defence Intelligence estimates that since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 Russia's army has suffered more than 1.1 million casualties – that is killed, wounded, captured or missing. Even conservative estimates put the number of Russians killed at 150,000. Ukraine has also suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertain.But Russia has been able to draw on such a massive pool of manpower that it has so far been able to replace its estimated 30,000 monthly battlefield casualties with fresh blood. Russia's economy has also been on a war footing for more than three years now: an economist has been placed in charge of the Defence Ministry, while its factories churn out ever more supplies of drones, missiles and artillery shells. According to a recent report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, Russia has been producing each month around 150 tanks, 550 infantry fighting vehicles, 120 Lancet drones and more than 50 artillery pieces.The UK, and most of its Western allies, are simply not anywhere near this point. EPA/ShutterstockUkraine has suffered catastrophic casualties but numbers are hard to ascertainAnalysts say it would take years for Western Europe's factories to come close to matching Russia's mass-production of weapons.\"The land war in Ukraine has shown beyond doubt that mass is absolutely vital for anybody that is going to face Russia on land,\" says Keir Giles, a Russia expert at Chatham House think tank. \"And having deep reserves vastly greater in number than the standing regular armed forces has been shown to be essential.\"How national service conversations backfiredFrance and Germany have both recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. The UK's former Head of the Army, Gen Sir Patrick Sanders, suggested in 2024, the year he retired, that the UK should train what he called \"a citizen army\" to fight a land war in the future. The idea was shot down by No. 10.\"I think it's a cultural thing within the UK,\" says Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at Rusi. \"So if you look at the states that are now looking towards [military service] - like Sweden, Germany and France - they are states who culturally still have an institutional memory of when they had that system. \"We haven't had national service since the 1960s and attempts to have that national conversation around it have pretty much backfired.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFrance has recently moved to revive a system of voluntary military service for 18-year olds\"The reality is, our armed forces cannot survive on a diet of government spin, over-the-horizon spending commitments and hollow rhetoric,\" Sir Ben Wallace, who was Defence Secretary in the Conservative government from 2019 to 2023, told the BBC.Responding to this, a spokesperson for the current Labour Defence Secretary, John Healey, told me: \"This characterisation is baseless. \"We increased defence spending by £5bn this year alone, signed 1,000 major contracts since the election and increased MOD spending with British businesses by 6% above inflation in the last year.\"He points to a new defence agreement with Norway, a £300m new investment in the Royal Navy's laser weapon and a £9bn investment into armed forces housing, adding: \"We're a government investing in the transformation of our forces, investing in our British service personnel... to create jobs and growth in Britain's communities.\"Getty ImagesGermany has also introduced voluntary military service for 18 year-oldsBut this is not about party politics. It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition. Billions of pounds have been spent on Ajax, an overdue armoured vehicle project still beset with problems. Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. More from InDepthToday, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia. They are referring to what is known as \"hybrid\" or \"grey-zone\" warfare, which includes events that are often deniable, such as cyber-attacks, disinformation and the alleged launching of drones close to airports and military bases in Nato countries.But worrying as these are, they pale compared to the crisis that would be triggered by a Russian military attack on a Nato country, especially if it involved seizing territory and people being killed.Getty ImagesA Eurofighter TyphoonThere are several potential flashpoints here, where Nato military chiefs fear that Putin, if he were allowed to achieve his aims in Ukraine, could eventually move on to seek new targets for aggression.One potential target is the Suwalki Gap, a 60-mile (100km) stretch of border between Poland and Lithuania, both Nato countries. This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once part of the Soviet Union and were ruled from Moscow. They all voted for independence and have since joined Nato, but all have Russian-speaking minorities and hence there is a risk that Mr Putin could be tempted to send his troops across the border \"to protect them from persecution\".The eastern Estonian town of Narva, for example, is an obvious potential target here, as the majority of its population speak Russian and it sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of Ivangorod. A UK battle group comprising some 900 British military personnel has been stationed in Estonia, about 80 miles west of Narva, since 2017. AFP via Gettty ImagesThe eastern Estonian town of Narva sits just across the river from the giant Russian fortress of IvangorodIn the event of war, the plan goes, it would be hurriedly reinforced to brigade strength of around 3,000 or more.Another possible flashpoint is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, which is administered by Norway but where Moscow already has a toehold in the coal mining town of Barentsburg.Litvinenko, Skripal and hostile acts on UK soilThe UK may well be Putin's enemy number one, having been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies, and having pushed for more powerful weapons to be delivered to help its defence.Hostile acts on UK soil that have been linked to President Putin include the murder with radioactive Polonium-210 of former KGB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - a public inquiry concluded that Putin \"probably\" approved his assassination - and the attempted murder of former Russian military intelligence officer turned MI6 agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, using the nerve agent, Novichok.Dawn Sturgess, a mother-of-three, later died after she sprayed the Novichok, disguised as perfume, on her wrists. Putin was \"morally responsible\" for her death, an inquiry concluded last week. Lord Anthony Hughes, the inquiry chair, said: \"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin.\"Russia, which has always denied involvement in the attacks and suggested more than 20 different possible explanations for Ms Sturgess's death, described the report's findings as \"tasteless fairy tales\".Sputnik/ AFP via Getty ImagesPutin accused European countries of hindering US efforts to bring peace in UkraineBut the UK is also a core member of the Nato alliance. While questions are certainly raised in private over the reliability of the current US administration in the White House, it is hard to envisage the UK ever having to fight Russia on its own.\"A pure UK-Russia conflict is not likely and can be disregarded, practically,\" says Mr Crump. \"We would definitely fight with allies, although Russia would most likely only launch a conflict if it felt Nato would break.\"The wild card here is US President Donald Trump. While the chairman of Nato's Military Committee, Adm Cavo Dragone recently assured me that the US president was absolutely committed to defending the Nato alliance, others are not so sure. Would Trump, for example, go to war to defend the Estonian town of Narva?Getty ImagesIt is extremely unlikely that the UK would ever find itself in a war with Russia on its own, unsupported by Nato allies\"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to what the United Kingdom is actually capable of,\" concludes Keir Giles of Chatham House, \"because there are so many different situations under which it could be challenged by Russia.\"As a society, the UK – unlike Poland, Finland and the Baltic States – is unquestionably not ready for war. Even serious preparations for such an eventuality would be both expensive, unpopular and politically risky.But Mr Giles of Chatham House offers some sobering advice to the British public: \"Recognise that the rights and freedoms and prosperity that they take for granted are in fact under threat and that freedom does not come for free.\"\"And understand that lives will have to change. And this is not the fault of the current government or even its predecessors — it's their fault that it is so expensive, but the root cause of the problem is in Moscow.\"Top image credit: Ministry of Defence /PA Wire/ Getty Images.

    "body": "4 hours agoDaniel SandfordUK correspondentDan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThe UK's asylum system is affected by inefficiencies, \"wasted public funds\" and a succession of \"short-term, reactive\" government policies that have moved problems elsewhere, the National Audit Office (NAO) has said.As part of its analysis, the spending watchdog looked at a sample of 5,000 asylum claims lodged almost three years ago, in January 2023.Since then, 35% (1,619) of those asylum seekers had been given some sort of protection such as refugee status, and 9% (452) had been removed from the country. But 56% (2,812) still did not have a final outcome in their case.The Home Office welcomed the analysis, which it said supported \"the case for fundamental reform of the asylum system\".Most of the cases in the remaining group (2,021 out of the 2,812) remained in a sort of \"limbo\", with no appeal lodged.The NAO's chief analyst, Ruth Kelly, told reporters: \"They've had their claim refused, but they're staying in the system with their case unresolved, and that's because of the difficulties in removal.\"A shortage of other types of accommodation means that large numbers of asylum seekers whose cases are not closed are being housed in hotels. The cost of accommodation in 2024-25 was £2.7bn.Enver Solomon, the chief executive of Refugee Council, said of the January 2023 analysis: \"The NAO's finding that more than half of people who applied for asylum almost three years ago still don't have an outcome is shocking.\"He said the report mirrors what the Refugee Council's front-line services see every day, \"an asylum system that is simply not functioning, where people wait months or even years for a decision… and costs keep rising\".The NAO's report criticises how successive governments have dealt with the current surge in small boats crossings that began in 2018. \"Interventions have tended to be reactive and focused on fixing an urgent problem in one part of the system only, such as intake or initial decisions, without a clear view of the effects on other parts,\" the report says.\"Increases in speed of processing have sometimes come at the expense of the quality of decisions, and improvements in one area have shunted problems elsewhere.\"The NAO gave the example of former prime minister Rishi Sunak's drive to clear the legacy asylum backlog in 2023, which then shifted pressure onto the appeals stage, simply creating another backlog in the courts.Shortage of judgesRuth Kelly said one of the most critical factors now was a shortage of specialist immigration judges to hear appeals. \"There's a severe capacity shortage with judges,\" she said. \"And judges told us there are poor incentives for working in the immigration and asylum tribunals… because of the taxing and the complex nature of the work, and also because of negative media attention, which makes it harder to recruit judges.\"The NAO said it would be looking for evidence that the government was now moving away from \"short-term, reactive fixes\" towards a \"sustainable whole-system approach\".The NAO found 56% (2,812) of asylum cases raised in January 2023 still did not have a final outcome in their caseIt said the current lengthy delays in the system \"erode public confidence in the system's fairness and effectiveness\".The NAO also found that it was impossible to track individual cases through the whole asylum process because there is no \"unique asylum case identifier\" shared by Home Office, court service and local authority computer systems.The report says that because the asylum applications are subject to fluctuating demand with significant peaks, it was important to build a flexible and resilient system that can respond to increases and decreases in demand.Ruth Kelly, the NAO analyst, said the government needed to avoid reverting to \"that pattern of counter-productive quick fixes that we have seen in the past\".A Home Office spokesperson said: \"The home secretary recently announced the most sweeping changes to the asylum system in a generation to deal with the problems outlined in this report.\"We are already making progress – with nearly 50,000 people with no right to be here removed, a 63% rise in illegal working arrests and over 21,000 small boat crossing attempts prevented so far this year.\"Our new reforms will restore order and control, remove the incentives which draw people to come to the UK illegally and increase removals of those with no right to be here.\"",

    "body": "An Australian man who was jailed in Singapore and deported for charging at pop star Ariana Grande has been ejected from a Lady Gaga concert in his home country.Johnson Wen said on Instagram that he was \"kicked out\" of the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane on Tuesday night before the Lady Gaga show had started.The 26-year-old, who has a history of disrupting concerts and celebrity events, was sentenced to nine days in jail by a Singapore court last month for grabbing Grande during the Asian premiere of Wicked: For Good.Wen, who told the Singaporean judge in mitigation that he would \"not do it again\", had not disrupted the performance in Brisbane, but was removed because of his history of public nuisance.Videos on social media showed security guards holding Wen by the arm and leading him out of the venue as the crowd both cheered and booed. The BBC has contacted Suncorp Stadium for comment.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, the venue said it was made aware that \"a known serial offender may attempt to attend and disrupt\" the concert by Lady Gaga, who is around halfway through her Mayhem World Tour.\"In the interest of the artist's safety, this individual was deemed a person of interest and not to be allowed to attend,\" it said.Wen has gained notoriety since grabbing Grande at the Wicked: For Good premiere in the South East Asian city state, which is known for its strict laws, including on public behaviour.\"You seem to be attention-seeking, thinking only of yourself and not the safety of others when committing these acts,\" Singaporean judge Christopher Goh reportedly told Wen.Wen was also banned from Singapore following the incident.Other videos on Wen's social media accounts show him jumping on stage and disrupting performances by global stars like Katy Perry and The Weeknd.The incident with Grande sparked outrage in Singapore. Fans accused Wen of \"re-traumatising\" the pop star and actress.Grande has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.",

    "body": "3 hours agoUS President Donald Trump has declared European leaders \"weak\", with his comments splashed on a number of Wednesday's front pages. According to the Metro, the president \"lambasted 'decaying' European nations\" for their failure to take action to end the Ukraine war, in a rant that the paper says \"puts peace in peril\".Claudia Winkleman beams on the front page of the Telegraph, after she was made an MBE by King Charles III for her services to broadcasting. The paper leads with quotes from its interview with the leader of France's National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, who said he would rewrite border policy to help the UK push small boats carrying migrants back into French waters.The i Paper says the UK and Europe are facing a \"huge reality check\" over their security, following Trump's condemnation of \"weak\" European leaders. The paper reports that No 10 has rejected the president's claims, but notes that the prime minister is meeting with the US ambassador at Downing Street.Trump's \"blistering attack\" on Europe leads the Independent's front page. Also featured on the front is Storm Bram, which led to \"travel misery\" and \"flood alerts\" across Britain. There are hopes that Kyiv will agree to the US-brokered peace deal \"by Christmas\", according to the Financial Times. It reports that the US has given Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky \"days\" to respond to their proposition, which will require Ukraine to accept territorial losses in exchange for \"unspecified US security guarantees\". \"Number of police forces cut to dozen under plan\", reads the headline on the front page of the Times, which reports that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is considering reducing police forces in England and Wales to just 12. Sources have told the paper that the home secretary has delayed the publication of a \"long-awaited\" blueprint for police reform until 2026, as she wants to make \"bolder changes than previously planned\". The Guardian reports that Sir Keir Starmer has called on European leaders to \"urgently curb\" joint human rights laws, in order to allow states to take \"tougher action to protect borders\". The paper says Labour has been \"condemned\" for calling for changes, with critics arguing that the alterations could allow countries to abandon some of the world's most vulnerable people.The front page of the Mail doesn't feature a single image, leading with the headline \"Asylum fiasco without end\". It says that a \"damning report\" from the National Audit Office has revealed \"huge gaps in systems\" and missing data, including on how many asylum seekers have gone missing since arriving in the UK.Photographs of teen Afghan nationals Israr Niazal and Jan Jahanzeb lead the Express, after they were sentenced on Tuesday for the rape of a 15-year-old girl in Leamington Spa. In her comment piece for the paper, Carole Malone asks \"How many more sexual assaults will it take?\"\"The lost Covid billions\" is the main story for the Mirror, after a report found that aid schemes were left open to risk during the pandemic. The paper says that fraud and error under the Tories cost £10.9bn, with much of the shortfall \"beyond recovery\".A photograph of the late Ozzy Osbourne alongside his wife Sharon is splashed across the front page of the Sun, after she revealed his final words to her before his death in July this year.\"Vlad's pussy galore\", reads the Daily Star's main headline, alleging that Larry the Cat \"snubbed\" the Ukrainian president during his visit to No 10 earlier this week.Related Internet Links",

The MoD said it would not comment further. The UK government has never confirmed the number of service people in Ukraine, but has previously acknowledged a small number in the country to support Ukraine's armed forces and provide security to diplomatic personnel.It is the first time a UK military death has been publicly announced since February 2022.The chairman of the Defence Committee, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, said: \"This tragic incident is a stark reminder of the risks faced by those who serve our country, even when operating away from the front lines. I pay tribute to their professionalism and commitment.\"Shadow defence secretary James Cartlidge said he was \"deeply saddened to hear the tragic news that a member of the UK armed forces died this morning in Ukraine\".\"My sincere condolences to his family and friends at this difficult time.\"Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion more than three years ago in February 2022.Efforts to negotiate an end to the war have intensified in recent weeks, including a visit by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to Downing Street on Monday where Sir Keir pledged the UK's support for Kyiv in achieving \"a just and lasting ceasefire\".The meeting was part of a push by Zelensky to deter the US from backing a peace deal which includes major concessions from Kyiv, and which allies fear would leave it vulnerable to future invasion, with Ukraine set to present alternative proposals to the White House.",

    "body": "Ex-children's boss to lead grooming gang inquiry9 hours agoMaia DaviesBBCBaroness Anne Longfield was the children's commissioner for England from 2015 to 2021A former children's commissioner will chair the inquiry into child sexual abuse by grooming gangs in what will be a \"moment of reckoning\", Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced. Baroness Anne Longfield will lead the inquiry, which was derailed when four women resigned from its survivors panel and two leading candidates to chair the investigation pulled out.Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said \"we must root out this evil once and for all\" as she told the Commons the peer would lead the three-year inquiry.The prime minister announced the inquiry for England and Wales in June after accepting the recommendation of Baroness Louise Casey's audit into group-based child sexual abuse.On her appointment, Baroness Longfield said the inquiry \"owes it to the victims, survivors and the wider public to identify the truth, address past failings and ensure that children and young people today are protected in a way that others were not\".She added: \"The inquiry will follow the evidence and will not shy away from difficult or uncomfortable truths wherever we find them.\"Baroness Longfield will be supported by panellists Zoe Billingham, a former inspector at HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, and Eleanor Kelly, former chief executive of Southwark Council.Mahmood said Baroness Longfield and the two panellists had been recommended by Baroness Casey following \"recent engagement with victims\" and would meet survivors later this week.But one of the survivors who quit the inquiry in October, Fiona Goddard, told the BBC no one on the panel \"had any consultations about these candidates\", signalling that their involvement had been \"just a box-ticking exercise\".She also criticised the selection of Baroness Longfield, who was appointed to the House of Lords in January and will resign the Labour whip to chair the inquiry.Ms Goddard said: \"The fact they have chosen someone so closely connected with the Labour government raises serious concerns over how impartial and independent this inquiry will be.\"Another victim, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC it was \"about time\" a chair was appointed, and that she liked Baroness Longfield.But she added: \"What if nothing changes? You hear with these big inquiries that recommendations are made, but they're not always implemented.\"The inquiry will comprise a series of targeted local investigations into the group-based child sexual exploitation of girls by grooming gangs, overseen by a national panel. As a statutory inquiry, it will have more powers - such as requiring people to testify and release other forms of evidence.Mahmood said one of these would be in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with the other locations to be decided.No area will be able to \"resist\" a local investigation during the inquiry, she added, which would last three years with a budget of £65m under draft terms of reference, which will be consulted on and confirmed by March 2026.The inquiry will also \"explicitly\" consider the backgrounds of offenders, including their ethnicity and religion, Mahmood said, and \"whether the authorities failed to properly investigate what happened out of a misplaced desire to protect community cohesion\".She noted that Baroness Casey's audit concluded that in some local areas a \"disproportionate\" amount of suspects for group-based child sexual exploitation were from Asian ethnic backgrounds where sufficient police data had been collected.\"Like every member of my community who I know, I am horrified by these acts,\" said Mahmood.\"The sickening acts of a minority of evil men - as well as those in positions of authority who looked the other way - must not be allowed to marginalise or demonise entire communities of law-abiding citizens.\"Baroness Casey's report also found that ethnicity data was not recorded for two-thirds of cases, meaning it was not robust enough to support conclusions about offenders at a national level.Mahmood said she had commissioned new research to \"rectify the unacceptable gaps\" in this area, and that she would draft a law as soon as possible so that police had to gather ethnicity data.She added that the government was working to disregard prostitution offences levelled against some victims with its Crime and Policing Bill.Responding in the Commons, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp called for an apology from the prime minister for having \"disgracefully smeared those calling for an inquiry as far-right\" earlier this year.In January, Sir Keir Starmer dismissed calls for a national inquiry, arguing the scandal had already been examined in a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay. He also suggested those calling for an investigation were \"jumping on a bandwagon\" and \"amplifying\" the demands of the far-right\". The scandal had returned to prominence partly because of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who was criticising the prime minister for not calling a national inquiry.Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch meanwhile said progress on the inquiry was welcome but survivors have been waiting too long for an inquiry they can trust.The inquiry was thrown into chaos in October when four women resigned from its survivors liaison panel in protest at how the government had handled the process so far.They called for Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips to resign, accusing her of \"betrayal\" for denying claims the investigation might be broadened beyond grooming gangs.They also expressed doubts about two candidates proposed to chair the inquiry because one had a background in social work and the other as a senior police officer - two professions facing questions about trust.At the time, Phillips denied claims of a cover-up and insisted the government was \"committed to exposing the failures\".Five others abuse survivors wrote to the prime minister to say they would only continue working with the inquiry if Phillips kept her job.In the Commons on Tuesday, Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin said the party welcomed the announcement and that victims would be \"properly consulted\".She asked whether Phillips would be called as a witness in the inquiry, claiming victims had \"lost all confidence\" in her.Mahmood said she hoped politicians would \"elevate beyond party political point-scoring\" and focus on delivering justice for victims.Liberal Democrat spokesperson Max Wilkinson said his party welcomed Mahmood's statement but said questions remained, such as how the inquiry would remain \"free from political influence\", earn the trust of victims and their families, and \"avoid stigmatising entire communities\" while thoroughly investigating the matter.",

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a recall notice on Tuesday for 700ml bottles of the drink being sold in England and Scotland. In a notice placed on its website, the FSA said Illva Saronno, the brand's parent company, was recalling bottles of Disaronno Originale because of \"the possible presence of small pieces of glass within some bottles of product, which could make it unsafe to drink\".It has identified seven batches which could include potentially contaminated bottles. Recall notices will now be placed at the point of sale in the shops where the bottles were sold, advising customers on what to do. The potential contamination is thought to have happened due to an \"anomaly on the bottle line\", according to the recall notice. The affected bottles have the following codes 25374, 25375, 25381, 25382, 25435, 25442, 25444, and consumers are able to check the numbers on the back of a bottle. The recall follows a similar notice issued in the Republic of Ireland on Monday, recalling the same product for the same issue. Recall notices are not uncommon, and can be issued for a number of different reasons. On Tuesday, health food brand Grape Tree issued recall notices for two of its products due to possible contamination with undeclared peanuts and milk. ",

    "body": "12 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterGoogleGoogle plans to launch smart glasses powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in 2026, after its previous high-profile attempt to enter the market ended in failure.The tech giant set expectations high in 2013 when it unveiled Google Glass, billed by some as the future of technology despite its odd appearance with a bulky screen positioned above the right eye. Google pulled the product in 2015 less than seven months after its UK release, but is now planning on re-entering the market with smart glasses with a cleaner look.But it comes after Meta has already made waves with its smart specs, which have sold two million pairs as of February.Google's new tech will let users interact with its own AI products, such as its chatbot Gemini.It plans to launch two different varieties - one designed to be provide assistance without any kind of screen, and another which has a display on the glasses themselves.While saying the first of the two types of AI glasses it is working on would come in 2026, Google has not given more information on what form it will take.Technology analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC the tech firm \"must avoid the pitfalls of its previous failed attempt\".\"Arguably, the move was ahead of its time, poorly conceived and executed,\" he said.\"Now represents an opportune moment, thanks to the success of Gemini.\"Bloomberg via Getty ImagesGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin demonstrated Google Glass on-stage at an event in 2012.Google will also have to contend with Meta, which unveiled its own AI-powered glasses earlier this year, having built on its existing collaborations with luxury eyewear brands Ray-Ban and Oakley.According to market research firm Counterpoint Research, the sector saw a surge in the first half of 2025, driven by demand for Meta's devices and the launch of similar products by smaller brands.It said sales of AI glasses had grown by more than 250% compared to the previous year.What went wrong with Google Glass?Google Glass was launched in 2013 as a pair of thin, wireframe glasses with a chunky right arm to accommodate a camera built into the corner of the right lens.Wearers could use the camera to take images and record their surroundings, while simultaneously interact with a digital display The device created a lot of excitement when it first appeared at a Google event in June 2012.But after its launch the following year, concerns about its impact on privacy, potential for abuse and questions about its style and usefulness arose - and grew until Google Google said it would stop making them in that form in 2015.A revamped version, Google Glass Enterprise, appeared two years later but was retired in 2023.Former BBC Technology Correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones was among those who had deemed Google's device in its initial form to be \"a failure\".The success of so-called wearable computers, he wrote, would likely depend on having the tech to bring their potential to life and them being \"both attractive to wear and so easy to use that you forget that you have them on\".Today, tech giants have tried to make AI and smart glasses more wearable by partnering with designer eyewear brands - and can pack more power and features into smaller, sleeker frames.But there remain concerns about privacy and usability.",

    "body": "4 hours agoLaura CressTechnology reporterGetty ImagesUK adults spent over half an hour longer online every day in 2025 than they did during the pandemic, according to an annual survey of internet habits by the regulator Ofcom.The Online Nation report found on average, people in the UK spent four hours and 30 minutes online every day in 2025 - 31 minutes longer than in 2021.Psychologist Dr Aric Sigman told the BBC this was not a problem in itself, but what mattered was \"what this time is displacing and how this may harm mental health\".He added the \"good news\" was society was \"beginning to question online time more critically\".In a year where the major UK Netflix drama Adolescence won praise and politicial attention for shining a light on misogynistic online content, the survey found adults were feeling less positive about the impact of the internet overall.Only a third (33%) said they felt it was \"good for society\" – down from 40% in 2024.However, nearly two thirds of people still believed the benefits of being online outweighed the risks.And many adults said they found the internet to be a source of creativity, with roughly three quarters agreeing being online helped them to broaden their understanding of the world.Children wary of 'brain rot'The report also explored children's experiences of being online.While more than eight in ten aged 8-17 said they were happy with the amount of time they spent on the internet, they also recognised there were negative impacts of endlessly scrolling on smartphones.The term \"brain rot\" was used by some children surveyed to describe the feeling they were left with after spending too long on their devices.It has become a popular phrase to describe overconsuming online posts and videos considered to be the opposite of mentally challenging.And Ofcom found across four of the main services used by children - YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok and WhatsApp – up to a quarter of the time 8 to 14-year-olds spent online was between 2100 and 0500.VPN use more than doublesFrom 25 July, Ofcom required websites operating in the UK with pornographic content to \"robustly\" age-check users, under the Online Safety Act.Some people began using a virtual private network (VPN) at this time - tools which can disguise your location online to allow you to use the internet as though you are in another country.The increase indicates people are likely using them to bypass requirements of the Act.After the age checks became mandatory, the survey said VPN use more than doubled, rising from roughly 650,000 daily users before July and peaking at over 1.4 million in mid-AugustBut it also found the number had since declined to around 900,000 in November.ASMR 'relaxing'The report also found 69% of children aged 13 to 17 said they used online services to help with their wellbeing, either to relax or improve their mood.More than half named ASMR as a tool they had used in particular to help them relax.These videos became an online phenomenon more than a decade ago - which some people claim causes them to feel a tingling sensation.It has led to an entire industry of online creators making special content viewed on platforms such as YouTube. But children were not solely positive about their online experiences.Seventy percent said they had issues with self-improvement media - involving toxic messaging or body shaming.",

    "body": "It sparked a debate over AI, but can Arc Raiders win a Bafta game award?12 hours agoTom RichardsonBBC NewsbeatEmbark StudiosArc Raiders has been a smash hit, but its use of AI has sparked debateA video game at the centre of a debate over artificial intelligence (AI) is in the running for the top prize at next year's Bafta Game Awards.Arc Raiders, from Swedish developer Embark Studios, has been a smash-hit since its October launch, selling more than four million copies.But the multiplayer shooter has been criticised for using text-to-speech tools to create additional lines, based on dialogue previously recorded by the game's actors.It is one of 10 titles longlisted for the prestigious best game award, with a shortlist to be announced in the run-up to April's annual ceremony.How does Arc Raiders use AI?Embark StudiosArc Raiders has won praise for its gameplay, visuals and soundArc Raiders is an extraction shooter game set on a futuristic Earth that has been overrun by hostile machines and the human race run underground.Teams of players compete to gather materials on the surface, avoiding each other and killer robots, with the aim of getting back to base in one piece.The game was generally well-received by critics and praised for its gameplay, level design and immersive audio.A disclosure on PC games store Steam, which said the game \"may use procedural and AI-based tools to assist with content creation\" during development, sparked a debate among players.While the game contains traditional recorded performances, the actors involved also gave permission for their voices to be used as training data for text-to-speech models.These are used outside of scripted scenes, and Embark has said this allows them to add updates to the game without needing to repeatedly call performers into a studio.Sandfall InteractiveRole-playing game Clair Obscur is also nominated for Bafta's big prizeThe use of AI-based tools in game development is not new, but it has become a bigger topic since generative AI (GenAI) - the technology behind products such as ChatGPT - became more prominent.As in other industries, it has prompted fears of job losses, and accusations of stealing artists' work without permission to train models.In the video game industry, which has seen record numbers of layoffs in recent years, those worries are heightened. Bafta's longlist was published on the same day as six European video game workers' unions issued a joint statement highlighting concerns including \"AI job displacement\".A year-long strike over AI protections for video game actors ended in July this year, with fears over replicating performances without consent being the main sticking point.  Players and reviewers complained that Arc Raiders' generated voice lines were lower quality than those delivered by human actors, and also expressed worries over performers losing out on work.Embark Studios has insisted it has not used GenAI in Arc Raiders, and that it does not wish to eliminate humans from its development process.Its co-founder, Stefan Strandberg, told website GamesRadar+ AI techniques have allowed the studio to work more efficiently while keeping its core team size small.Other games in the longlist have also been criticised by fans for using AI in development.The Alters, which appears in the performance and narrative categories, was found to have used AI translation, while early versions of Clair Obscur contained generated textures.In both cases, developers said the resulting text and images were placeholders never intended to appear in the final releases.  Raw FuryAdventure game Blue Prince was one of the best-reviewed games of 2025 Bafta has 1,700 games industry members who are eligible to vote in its annual awards and decide what gets nominated.It does not currently have an official position on AI usage in game development, but Newsbeat understands it is in regular discussion with its members on the topic.Its technical achievement award, which Arc Raiders is up for, lists AI as one of the elements of engineering and programming that jurors can take into account.The awards do have strict eligibility rules around remakes and remasters of previously released games, and downloadable content, or DLC, which expands on an existing title.In a statement released with the longlist, Bafta Games committee chair Tara Saunders said the awards were \"a fantastic opportunity to spotlight the creativity and craft shaping this year's games\".\"This list showcases a wide range of games to dive into... honours the teams behind these standout titles, and shines a light on the incredible skill across our whole industry,\" she added.The official Bafta Games 2026 longlist can be found here.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "11 hours agoPaul SeddonPolitical reporterWatch: French far-right leader tips Nigel Farage to be next UK PMNigel Farage has met Jordan Bardella, the leader of France's far-right National Rally party, in London. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Bardella told the BBC's Nick Robinson he believed the \"extremely resilient\" Reform UK leader would become the UK's next prime minister.The 30-year-old French MEP is leading in opinion polls to win the first round of the next presidential election due in 2027.A Reform source said the two politicians discussed small boat crossings and energy policy, particularly nuclear energy.Farage has in the past kept his distance from National Rally (RN), the successor party to the National Front (FN), formerly led by Marine Le Pen.Le Pen was banned from public office for five years in March after a conviction for embezzling EU funds, barring her from standing in the 2027 presidential race.She has condemned the verdict as a \"political decision\" and plans to appeal, with a court due to rule next year.As leader of Ukip, Farage kept his party out of an alliance with the FN in the European Parliament.But writing in 2017, he endorsed her to win that year's presidential election, praising Le Pen for reshaping the party, adding that under her leadership since 2011 it had become \"about sovereignty, not race\".His Brexit Party did not rule out entering the same group as the rebranded RN after the European Parliament elections in 2019, but ultimately decided not to join the group ahead of the ejection of the party's MEPs in 2020 in the wake of Brexit.However he criticised her party's more interventionist economic policies last year, saying they would be a \"disaster\" for France. 'That's politics' Speaking to the Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast, Bardella acknowledged Farage \"may have been harsh in the past\" towards his party. \"But that's politics - you're allowed to evolve,\" he added. \"My political party has also evolved, even in its name.\"He added that if it took power, RN would seek to implement a more restrictive immigration policy and look again at the country's migration agreements. Bardella's party wants to place a \"national priority\" on welfare, limiting benefits to French people.He said he believed in police co-operation between France and the UK on small boats, but with the intention of returning migrants to their \"countries of origin\" rather than the French coast. He said: \"If I am head of the French government tomorrow, France will no longer be a country of mass immigration. \"Therefore, by implementing measures designed to drastically reduce immigration to France, this will inevitably have consequences for the departure of migrants from Calais, in northern France, to Great Britain.\"Writing on X after the meeting, Bardella said the pair had discussed shared challenges facing the UK and France, including \"mass immigration\" and boosting economic growth. Listen to the full interview with Jordan Bardella on BBC Radio 4 at 17:30 GMT on Saturday or on BBC Sounds from Wednesday. ",

    "body": "The Prince of Wales has paid tribute to pioneering elephant conservationist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who died aged 83 at his home in Nairobi on Monday.Douglas-Hamilton spent his life studying and campaigning to protect African elephants, becoming a world-leading expert on their behaviour in the wild. His groundbreaking research exposed the devastating effects of poaching - often at great risk to his own safety - and was instrumental in the banning of the international ivory trade.Prince William praised the zoologist as \"a man who dedicated his life to conservation and whose life's work leaves lasting impact on our appreciation for, and understanding of, elephants\".\"The memories of spending time in Africa with him will remain with me forever,\" added Prince William, who is a royal patron for the African wildlife conservation charity, Tusk, of which Douglas-Hamilton was an ambassador. \"The world has lost a true conservation legend today, but his extraordinary legacy will continue,\" the charity's founder Charles Mayhew said in a statement.Born in 1942 to an aristocratic British family in Dorset, England, Douglas-Hamilton studied biology and zoology in Scotland and Oxford before moving to Tanzania to research elephant social behaviour.It was there at Lake Manyara National Park that he began documenting every elephant he encountered, eventually becoming so familiar with the herds he could recognise them by the unique shapes of their ears and wrinkles on their skin.\"The thing about elephants is that they have a lot in common with human beings,\" he said in a 2024 documentary about his work, A Life Among Elephants.Friend and fellow conservationist Jane Goodall, who died in October, was featured in the documentary, and said he had shown the world that elephants are capable of feeling just like humans.\"I think his legacy will be one of a man who did so much to help people understand how majestic, how wonderful elephants are, and to learn more about their way of life,\" Goodall said.But that work did not always come easy: he was charged at by elephants, almost killed by a swarm of bees and shot at by poachers. In 2010, a flood destroyed his research facility in Kenya and years of work was lost.Despite the hardships, Douglas-Hamilton remained steadfast in his mission to raise awareness of the plight of African elephants, becoming one of the leading voices to alert the world of the ivory poaching crisis, which he described as \"an elephant holocaust\".He later campaigned for an international ban on the commercial trade in ivory, and in 1989 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species was signed, an international agreement between governments.After the agreement failed to wipe out the trade completely, Douglas-Hamilton turned his attention to China and the US, the two main markets for ivory. Chinese President Xi Jinping and then-US President Barack Obama agreed to a near-total ban on its import and export in 2015.Douglas-Hamilton established Save the Elephants in 1993, a charity dedicated to safeguarding the animals and deepening human understanding of their behaviour.The organisation's CEO Frank Pope, who is also his son-in-law, said: \"Iain changed the future not just for elephants, but for huge numbers of people across the globe. His courage, determination and rigour inspired everyone he met.\"In his own words, Douglas-Hamilton expressed optimism for the future of his life's work.\"I think my greatest hope for the future is that there will be an ethic developed of human-elephant coexistence,\" he once said.Iain Douglas-Hamilton is survived by his wife Oria, children Saba and Dudu, and six grandchildren.",

    "body": "An explosion has killed at least eight people and injured 18 others during Friday prayers inside a mosque in the Syrian city of Homs, the health ministry has said.Pictures from Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, show the inside of the Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib Mosque with black, scorched walls, smashed windows and blood on the carpet.Officials believe that an explosive was detonated inside the building, Sana reports, citing a security source. While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing in a statement on X that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind a deadly church bombing in Damascus, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.In March, security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring ",

    "body": "6 hours agoLauren TurnerPA MediaThe King's Christmas Broadcast was the most-watched TV programme in the UK on Christmas Day, overnight data has shown.Nearly 7m tuned in on the BBC, ITV, Sky News and GB News to watch King Charles deliver his annual message, this year recorded in Westminster Abbey.After the King, the next most popular show was The Scarecrows' Wedding on BBC One, watched by 4.3m. It is based on the picture book by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, who wrote and illustrated The Gruffalo. All figures are based on \"overnight\" TV ratings - which do not include viewers who watch Christmas specials on catch-up services during the rest of the festive period.The King used his traditional speech to invoke the wartime spirit, urging people to get to know their neighbours and \"never lose sight\" of the values in which communities came together \"in the face of such great challenge\".The figures also do not include the small number watching the King's message on Sky Showcase, Sky Mix HD or other non-TV platforms.Strictly Come Dancing's Christmas Special - which saw Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman host the show together for the final time - was the third most popular programme, with 4.2m tuning in.They ended the festive special with their \"keep dancing!\" catchphrase, with Winkleman saying the audience watching over the years had \"meant a world to us\". There was a drop in viewers for EastEnders however, eighth most-watched this year with 2.85m for the first of its two Christmas Day episodes. The second did not make the viewing figures top 10. Soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale, both on ITV1, did not make the top 10 with their Christmas Day episodes. This year, BBC programmes made up nine of the top 10 most-watched programmes across the day. A festive episode of the 1% Club, the quiz hosted by Lee Mack, on ITV1, was in ninth place with 2.75m watching.The BBC's chief content officer Kate Phillips said this was \"a timely reminder that shared moments really do still matter even in a world of so much choice\".

    "body": "4 hours agoRaffi BergMagen David AdomThe attacker drove into people and then carried out a stabbing several miles away, police sayTwo people have been killed in what police say was a \"rolling terror attack\" in northern Israel.Police said the attacker ran over a pedestrian in the eastern city of Beit Shean, then drove on before stabbing a woman near Ein Harod, about 8 miles (12.5km) to the west.A 68-year-old man was killed and a 16-year-old boy was hurt in the ramming, officials said, whilst the stabbing victim was an 18-year-old woman.The suspect was eventually shot and wounded later by a civilian outside the city of Afula, according to police.A day before the attack, an Israeli reservist was fired after video emerged of him ramming a praying Palestinian with a quad bike. The suspect in Friday's attack came from the village of Qabatiya, in the northern occupied West Bank, Israel's defence minister said.Following the incident, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was preparing to carry out an operation in the Qabatiya area. Defence Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the IDF to act \"forcefully and immediately\". The IDF said the suspect had \"infiltrated into Israeli territory several days ago\".Israel's Kan News public broadcaster said the 37-year-old man had been working illegally in Israel and had used his employer's vehicle in the attack. The incident comes a day after the army reservist drove a quad bike into a Palestinian man who was praying on a roadside in the West Bank.Video shows the man, dressed in civilian clothes but with a firearm, ramming the victim with the vehicle. Reports say the victim was unhurt. The Israeli military said the soldier - who had earlier opened fire in a nearby village - had been fired and his weapon confiscated.Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have surged in the West Bank in recent years, according to the United Nations, with more than a thousand killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel of 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.More than 70,600 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.Additional reporting by Tom McArthur",

    "body": "2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterA US judge has temporarily blocked the detention of British social media campaigner Imran Ahmed, who took legal action against the US government over having his visa removed.The Center for Countering Digital Hate founder was among five people denied US visas after the Trump administration accused them of seeking to \"coerce\" tech platforms into censoring free speech.The move brought a backlash from European leaders defending the work of organisations monitoring online content.Mr Ahmed, a US permanent resident, had warned that being detained and possibly deported would tear him away from his American wife and child. Praising the judge's decision, he told BBC News he would not be \"bullied\".Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said online that the individuals were blocked over concerns that they had organised efforts to pressure US platforms to censor and \"punish American viewpoints they oppose\".Mr Ahmed filed a legal complaint on Wednesday against officials including Rubio and US Attorney General Pamela Bondi over the decision to have him sanctioned.In court documents seen by the BBC, US District Judge Vernon S Broderick said on Thursday he had granted Mr Ahmed's request for a temporary restraining order.The judge also temporarily blocked the officials from detaining Mr Ahmed without the chance for his case to be heard.The BBC has contacted the state department and White House for comment.When approached by AFP news agency, a state department spokesperson was quoted as saying: \"The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here.\"Mr Ahmed said: \"I will not be bullied away from my life's work of fighting to keep children safe from social media's harm and stopping antisemitism online.\"His lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, said the speed of the judge's decision was telling. \"The federal government can't deport a green card holder like Imran Ahmed, with a wife and young child who are American, simply because it doesn't like what he has to say,\" she said.In 2023, Mr Ahmed's centre was sued by Elon Musk's social media company after it reported on a rise in hate speech on the platform since the billionaire's takeover of the firm, now called X.The case was dismissed but an appeal is pending. Speaking to the BBC News Channel on Friday evening, Mr Ahmed said: \"We were sued by Elon Musk a couple of years ago, unsuccessfully; a court found that he was trying to impinge on our First Amendment rights to free speech by using law to try and silence our accountability work.\"Mr Ahmed said the last few days have been \"rather confusing\". He said the Center for Countering Digital Hate \"has worked with administrations both Republican and Democrat\" and feels he is now being targeted because the organisations his group researches do not like being called out.\"This does seem to be...  perhaps even an error, goaded on by some of the tech companies, the social media platforms, the AI platforms that the Center for Countering Digital Hate studies and holds accountable\".",

    "body": "Thailand carried out air strikes on a disputed border area with Cambodia on Friday, as officials from both sides continued talks to try to end fighting.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry accused Thailand of \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses and injuring several people.Fighting broke out again earlier this month after a fragile ceasefire in July halted five days of intense border clashes. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the hostilities resumed.Both countries have blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.Since then, fighting has spread to nearly every province along the 500-mile (800km) border.Cambodia's defence ministry said Friday's attacks were in the north-western Banteay Meanchey province. Up to 40 bombs were dropped by F-16 fighter jets, the ministry said in a Facebook post.Thailand said the action was aimed at controlling Nong Chan village, and was \"carried out efficiently and successfully\".It came as Thai and Cambodian negotiators held their third day of talks at a border checkpoint. Defence ministers from both sides are due to join the discussions on Saturday.Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said on Friday that once both sides agreed to each other's conditions, a ceasefire agreement could be signed.\"I hope this time will be the last one we'd have to sign, so that peace can occur in the area,\" he said, \"[and] people can return to their homes.\"The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.The dispute between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years.But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on 24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.",

    "body": "3 hours agoJaroslav LukivandSean SeddonBBCOne strike hit a field near a village in Sokoto stateThe US has launched strikes against militants linked to the Islamic State group (IS) in north-western Nigeria, where militants have sought to establish a foothold. Camps run by the group in Sokoto state were hit near the border with Niger, the US military said. Casualty numbers are unclear, but both US and Nigerian officials say militants were killed.US President Donald Trump said the Christmas Day strikes had been \"deadly\" and labelled the group \"terrorist scum\", saying they had been \"targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians\".Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar told the BBC it was a \"joint operation\" and had \"nothing to do with a particular religion\".Tuggar said the strikes had been planned \"for quite some time\" using intelligence provided by Nigeria. He also did not rule out further strikes. Referencing the timing of strikes - which took place late on Thursday - he said they did not have \"anything to do with Christmas\".The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but largely in the north-east. But in recent years a smaller group - known locally as Lakurawa - has sought to establish a base in north-western Sokoto state. On Friday morning, the Nigerian foreign ministry said authorities were engaged in \"security co-operation with international partners\", including the US. \"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the north-west,\" it said.The US military said an \"initial assessment\" suggested \"multiple\" fatalities in Sokoto state.The chairman of the Tangaza local government area, Isa Salihu Bashir, told the BBC the strikes had \"hit some Lakurawa terrorist camps\". He said many fighters had been killed but could not confirm the death toll.Bashir added that border patrols on the Niger side reported seeing Lakurawa fighters fleeing the targeted areas.A separate strike on Thursday hit a field in the town of Jabo, further south in Sokoto, but there were no reports of casualties. \"Something that looked like a plane flashed and crashed... in fields,\" eyewitness Umar Jabo told the BBC.He said there was no issue with IS in the area: \"Here in Jabo, we live peacefully, and there is no conflict between us and Christians.\"The Trump administration has previously accused the Nigerian government of failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks and has claimed a \"genocide\" is being perpetrated.Trump has labelled Nigeria a \"country of particular concern\", a designation used by the US state department that provides for sanctions against countries \"engaged in severe violations of religious freedom\".The US military was ordered to prepare to intervene in Nigeria in November.US Department of DefenseThe US defence department posted a short video that appears to show a missile being launched from a military vesselAt the time, an adviser to Nigerian President Bola Tinubu told BBC News that militants had targeted people \"across faiths\", and said any US military action should be carried out jointly. Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with about 220 million people, divided roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims.In a social media post late on Christmas Day confirming the strikes, Trump said that he would \"not allow Radical Islamic Terrorism to prosper\".US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that he was \"grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation\". The Pentagon later posted a short video that appeared to show a missile being launched from a ship.Militants allied to IS have sought to establish a presence in two north-western states, while a separate IS-linked group has a stronghold in north-eastern BornoJihadist groups such as Boko Haram and IS-linked offshoots have wrought havoc in north-eastern Nigeria for more than a decade, killing thousands of people.Most victims have been Muslims, according to Acled, a group that analyses political violence around the world.Nigerian human rights lawyer and conflict analyst Bulama Bukati told the BBC that Lakurawa started slipping into Nigeria in 2018 but over the past 18 months to two years had established camps in Sokoto state and Kebbi state.\"They have been launching attacks and imposing their social laws over people in Sokoto state over the past 18 months or so.\"The Nigeria strikes are the second major US intervention targeting IS in recent weeks.Last week, the US said it had carried out a \"massive strike\" against IS in Syria.US Central Command (Centcom) said fighter jets, attack helicopters and artillery had struck more than 70 targets. Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.Those strikes were launched in retaliation for the killing of three Americans - two soldiers and a civilian interpreter - in an ambush. ",

Mike Brown said the conditions at Budleigh Salterton was the worst conditions he had seenMike Brown, 60, who has lived in Budleigh Salterton for nearly 30 years, said the sea conditions on Thursday were the \"worst conditions\" he had ever seen.After entering the sea and being \"unable to get out\", Mr Brown said he only made it out with the help of \"two very brave men\" and sustained small injuries.He said: \"After successive waves crashing me into the stones, I managed to get into relatively shallow water, but I was spent.\"I had no energy left to stand and I'd taken a number of blows to the head.\"These two men without any concern for their own safety waded in to help me.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

Somaliland's president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, called the development \"a historic moment\".Recognition by Israel could encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing the region's diplomatic credentials and access to international markets.But the decision has been condemned by the foreign ministers of Somalia, Egypt, Turkey and Djibouti, who in a statement affirmed their \"total rejection\" of Israel's announcement.Abdullahi said in a statement that Somaliland would join the Abraham Accords, in what he called a step toward regional and global peace.Somaliland was committed to building partnerships, boosting mutual prosperity and promoting stability across the Middle East and Africa, he added.The two countries had agreed to establish \"full diplomatic ties, which will include the appointment of ambassadors and the opening of embassies\", Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said in a statement on X.\"I have instructed my ministry to act immediately to institutionalise ties between the two countries across a wide range of fields,\" he said.Meanwhile, Egypt's foreign minister held separate phone calls with his counterparts in Somalia, Turkey and Djibouti to discuss issues including Israel's declaration.In a statement, Egypt's foreign ministry said the four countries reaffirmed their support for Somalia's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and warned against unilateral steps that could undermine stability or create what they called \"parallel entities\" to Somalia's state institutions.They also argued that recognising the independence of parts of sovereign states would set a dangerous precedent under international law and the United Nations Charter. The statement added that the ministers reiterated their rejection of any plans to displace Palestinians outside their homeland.Israel has for years been trying to bolster relations with countries in the Middle East and Africa, but recent wars including in Gaza and against Iran have been seen as a hindrance to democracy.Historic deals struck late in Trump's first term in 2020, known as the Abraham Accords, saw several countries including Muslim-majority United Arab Emirates and Morocco normalise relations with Israel, with other countries joining later. Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden, and has its own money, passports and police force. Born in 1991 after a war of independence against former dictator General Siad Barre, it has grappled with decades of isolation ever since.With a population of almost six million, the self-proclaimed republic has recently been at the centre of several regional disputes involving Somalia, Ethiopia and Egypt.Last year, an agreement between landlocked Ethiopia and Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for a port and military base angered Somalia.",

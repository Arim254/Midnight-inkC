Orban wants to keep buying it, but Trump wants countries to wean themselves off Russian energy and help put the brakes on Russia’s war in Ukraine. Will Trump choose to keep an old friend close, or put pressure on Putin? We speak to Nick Thorpe, the BBC’s correspondent in Budapest, who has covered Orban since the 1980s. \nProducer: Viv Jones \nExecutive producer: James Shield \nSenior news editor: China Collins \nMix: Travis Evans  \nPhoto: U.S. President Donald Trump and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

    "body": "Alex Salmond died with debts of more than £340,000 and assets of just over £2,000, according to the accountants winding up his estate.  The news came as Kenny Craig, an accountant with insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor, was named as trustee in sequestration of the former first minister's estate.This is a professional appointed to manage the bankruptcy process in Scotland and follows an application by Salmond's widow Moira.It emerged last week that Salmond's estate had been forced to seek the equivalent of bankruptcy over the cost of court action taken against the Scottish government in the final years of his life.The firm said part of that process will involve considering the value of the legal action the former SNP leader was pursuing over the handling of a misconduct investigation into him.Salmond previously won £512,000 from the Scottish government after it was found the process in handling harassment complaints against him by civil servants was \"tainted with apparent bias\".He was later acquitted of a number of sexual misconduct charges at a criminal trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.Begbies Traynor, which describes itself as the \"UK's leading corporate rescue and recovery practice\", confirmed the winding-up of Salmond's estate would include considering the value of all assets, including rights of action raised against the Scottish government.At the time of his death in October 2024, the former first minister had raised further proceedings seeking damages against the government he once led.Thomas McKay, managing partner for Begbies Traynor in Scotland, said: \"This is an unusual and complex appointment, particularly because it involves ongoing legal proceedings by a high-profile individual against the Scottish government.\"Kenny Craig, supported by our personal insolvency team at Begbies Traynor Group, will of course do all that he can to manage the sequestration as respectfully and sensitively as possible.\"Salmond died after suffering a heart attack while attending an event in North Macedonia.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSteve Mellen and Alys DaviesA former British soldier is facing extradition to Kenya in connection with the alleged murder of a 21-year-old woman there in 2012.The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Robert James Purkiss was arrested in Tidworth, Wiltshire on 6 November and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.He was arrested by specialist officers from the NCA's National Extradition Unit in connection with the killing of Agnes Manjiru after a warrant was issued in September, the agency added.Mr Purkiss, 38, told the court he intended to contest the extradition and was remanded into custody ahead of his next appearance at the same court on 14 November.His lawyers told the court that he \"vehemently denies\" murder.Ms Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel in the town of Nanyuki, about 124 miles (200km) north of Nairobi, three months after she had gone missing on 31 March 2012. She had a five-month-old baby at the time.Her body was found near a British army training camp. On the night she was killed, she had reportedly been at a bar with friends where British soldiers were also present. Ms Wanjiru's niece, Esther Njoki, met the UK's defence minister last month in order to push for Mr Purkiss's extradition. In a statement issued through Leigh Day, the lawyers acting for Ms Wanjiru's family, on Friday Ms Njoki said: \"My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt's case has been arrested.\"We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.\"Leigh Day partner Tessa Gregory said: \"This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.\"We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.\"Ms Wanjiru's family has long accused the British army of covering up her death and the Kenyan authorities of failing to properly investigate the case at the time.An inquest into her death was opened in 2018 following pressure from Ms Wanjiru's family, as well as Kenyan rights groups and feminists.In 2019, it concluded that Ms Wanjiru had been unlawfully killed by one or two British soldiers and that she had suffered stab wounds to the chest and abdomen.Later in 2021, a Sunday Times investigation reported that a British soldier had confessed to colleagues that he killed Ms Wanjiru. The soldier left the army after the incident and reportedly continued to live in the UK.In 2024, the army announced it was launching an internal review into the conduct of British soldiers in Kenya, including in Nanyuki.It found 35 suspected cases of soldiers having engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, including transactional sex, with local women - nine of these being after the army officially banned such conduct in 2022.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump says he will consider allowing Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban to buy Russian oil, in an exemption from sanctions aimed at helping to end the Ukraine war.Speaking on Friday during Orban's visit to the White House, Trump said an allowance might be made because \"it's very difficult for him [Orban] to get the oil and gas from other areas\". The comments come after the US effectively blacklisted two of Russia's largest oil companies last month, threatening sanctions on those that buy from them.Following the meeting, Hungary's foreign minister wrote on X that the US had given Budapest \"a full and unlimited exemption from sanctions on oil and gas\". Trump added that while Hungary faced unique logistical challenges, including access to a sea that could be used to drill oil, he was \"very disturbed\" by other European countries that he said continued to buy Russian commodities despite not being landlocked.Orban, who is one of Trump's closest allies in Europe and who has long resisted EU efforts to pressure Moscow over Ukraine, has defended his energy ties with Russia, saying on Friday that pipelines are neither \"ideological\" nor \"political\", but a \"physical reality\" due to the lack of ports.He has been using his country's heavy dependence on Russian oil and gas as a means to maintain his good relations with Moscow, as well as a platform upon which he hopes to win re-election next April in Hungary. He has promised \"cheap Russian energy\" to voters.Trump and Orban also discussed the war in Ukraine on Friday - their first formal talks since Trump returned to power - including the possibility of holding talks with Putin.\"He [Orban] understands Putin and knows him very well... I think that Viktor feels we're going to get that war ended in the not-too-distant future\", Trump said.The Hungarian leader, meanwhile, said only their two nations truly wanted peace in Ukraine. \"All the other governments prefer to continue the war because many of them think that Ukraine can win on the front line, which is a misunderstanding of the situation.\"Trump asked him: \"So you would say that Ukraine cannot win that war?\" To which Orban replied: \"You know, a miracle can happen.\"Aside from the issue of oil and gas sanctions, Hungary's export-driven car industry has been hit by Trump's tariffs on European goods, adding to an already weak economy. Despite frequent clashes with EU leaders over migration, democracy, and the rule of law, Trump urged Europe to \"respect this leader very, very strongly because he's been right on immigration.\"with additional reporting by Nick Thorpe",

    "body": "4 hours agoMadeline Halpert and Christal HayesGetty ImagesNobel Prize-winning American scientist James Watson, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, has died aged 97. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of the 20th century, he identified the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953 alongside a British scientist, Francis Crick, setting the stage for rapid advances in molecular biology.But his reputation and standing were badly hurt by his comments on race and sex. In a TV programme, he made a reference to a disputed view that genes cause differences between black and white people on IQ tests.The death of Watson was confirmed to the BBC by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he worked and researched for decades. Watson shared the Nobel in 1962 with Maurice Wilkins and Crick for the DNA's double helix structure discovery.\"We have discovered the secret of life,\" they said at the time. Hs later comments on race led to him saying that he felt ostracised by the scientific community. In 2007, the scientist, who once worked at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory, told the Times newspaper that he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\", because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours - whereas all the testing says not really\".The comments led to him losing his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. His additional comments in 2019 - when he once again suggested a link between race and intelligence - led the lab to strip his honorary titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee.\"Dr Watson's statements are reprehensible, unsupported by science,\" the laboratory said in a statement.DNA was discovered in 1869, but researchers had yet to discover its structure, and it took until 1943 before scientists realised that DNA made up the genetic material in cells.Working with images obtained by King's College researcher Rosalind Franklin, without her knowledge, Crick and Watson were able to construct a physical model of the molecule. Maurice Wilkins, who shared the Nobel with Crick and Watson, had worked with Franklin to determine the DNA molecule's structure.Watch: James Watson and Francis Crick awarded Nobel Prize in 1962Watson sold his Nobel gold medal at auction for $4.8m (£3.6m) in 2014, saying he was letting go of the medal because he felt ostracised by the scientific community after his remarks on race.A Russian billionaire bought it for $4.8m and promptly gave it back to him.Watson was born in Chicago in April 1928 to Jean and James, descendants of English, Scottish and Irish settlers.He won a scholarship to study at the University of Chicago at the age of 15.  There, he became interested in the new technique of diffraction, in which X-rays were bounced off atoms to reveal their inner structures.To pursue his research into DNA structures, he went to Cambridge, where he met Crick, with whom he began constructing large-scale models of possible structures for DNA.Later, after his scientific discovery, Watson and his wife, Elizabeth, moved to Harvard, where he became professor of biology. The couple had two sons - one of whom suffered from schizophrenia.In 1968, he took over the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York State - an old institution which he was credited with turning into one of the world's foremost scientific research institutes.",

    "body": "Israel has received a coffin that Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad said contains the body of a hostage, Israel's military says.Hamas's armed wing said the body had been found on Friday in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The body has been transported to Israel via the Red Cross for identification.Before this handover, Hamas had returned all 20 living hostages and 22 out of 28 deceased hostages under the first phase of a ceasefire deal that started on 10 October. Five of the six dead hostages still in Gaza were Israelis and one was Thai.Israel has criticised Hamas for not yet returning all the bodies. Hamas says it is hard to find them under rubble.During the first phase of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. Israel has also handed over the bodies of 285 Palestinians in exchange for the bodies of the 19 Israeli hostages returned by Hamas, along with those of three foreign hostages - one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian.The parties also agreed to an increase of aid to the Gaza Strip, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt to fighting, although violence has flared up as both sides accused one another of breaching the deal.Israel launched air strikes after accusing Hamas fighters of killing two of its soldiers on 19 October and of killing another soldier on 28 October. Hamas said it was unaware of clashes in the area of the first incident and had no connection to the second attack.Israeli military actions have killed at least 241 people since the start of the ceasefire, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage. All but one of the dead hostages still in Gaza were abducted in the attack.At least 68,875 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, the health ministry reported.",

    "body": "12 hours agoDaniel Wainwright, Gerry Georgieva and Nicholas BarrettBBC VerifyGetty ImagesThe recent cases of prisoners being mistakenly released has put a fresh spotlight on the demands facing the justice system.Prison overcrowding, staffing levels and government funding have all been called into question.How many prisoners have been released by mistake?There were 262 prisoners accidentally released in the 12 months to March 2025, compared with 115 the previous year.Of 121 prisons across England and Wales, 72 released at least one prisoner by mistake in 2024-25.The overall number of releases has also increased - but not by as much.  There were just over 57,000 releases of prisoners who had finished the custodial part of their sentences in England and Wales in 2024-25. This includes the period when some prisoners were released after serving 40% of their sentence.The year before there were about 50,000 releases. That's a rise in the number of releases of about 13% - a lot lower proportionally than the increase in errors.One in 10 released from 'escort areas'The majority of accidental releases were from a prison itself.Pentonville Prison in London released the most in 2024-25 - 16, up from six the year before.To put that in context, Pentonville had a population of just under 1,200 in March 2025. So that's equivalent to letting out more than one in every 100 prisoners by mistake over the year.Another category of mistaken release is from \"escort areas\" - places where prisoners are being taken between prisons, to and from court hearings or to immigration removal centres.Around one in 10  were released in error from these areas, the figures show.However it's not clear from the data how many had been convicted or were in prison on remand, awaiting a trial or sentencing hearing.Staffing challengesAt the end of June 2025, there were a total of 36,627 people working in prison service establishments across England and Wales.That's 787 fewer people than a year ago, but well above the staff numbers in previous years.However staff turnover is an ongoing issue.In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left the prison service, almost twice the 7.1% turnover rate across the Civil Service.Half had spent a year or less in the job.Sickness rates also impact operations.In the year to June, prison staff missed an average of 12 days of work due to sickness. In two out of five cases, the absence was related to a mental health issue.For comparison, average workers in the UK miss just over four days a year due to sickness.Government funding The mistaken releases have led to renewed questions over government funding for the justice system.Former Conservative justice secretary Alex Chalk says the MoJ, which is responsible for prisons, the probation system, courts and legal aid, spends in a year the amount \"spent by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) every two weeks\".MoJ is spending this year is around £13bn  according to the National Audit Office - compared to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which spent nearly £276bn in 2023-24.And, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, the MoJ is expected to be 5.6% smaller than it was in 2010 by the end of the current parliament.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJonny HumphriesLiverpool Crown CourtPAJoey Barton has been convicted on six countsFormer footballer Joey Barton has been found guilty of six counts of sending \"grossly offensive\" social media posts aimed at broadcaster Jeremy Vine and television pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko.Barton, 43, compared Aluko and Ward to the serial killer couple Fred and Rose West, and called Vine a \"bike nonce\" in posts sent between January and March 2024.Jurors at Liverpool Crown Court accepted the prosecution's argument that Barton, from Huyton in Merseyside, had \"crossed the line between free speech and a crime\". But they cleared the ex-Manchester City and Newcastle player of six other counts of sending a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety.Judge Andrew Menary KC warned Barton about wearing a scarf printed with a British flag in the dock as a \"stunt\", and told the former footballer's legal team he would not be permitted to wear it when he is sentenced on 8 December. Barton was reminded his bail conditions prohibit him from mentioning his three victims in any way before that hearing.PA/REUTERSThe charges related to posts Barton made on X about Lucy Ward, Eni Aluko and Jeremy VineDuring his trial, Barton argued he was the victim of a \"political prosecution\" and that his comments aimed at football pundits Aluko and Ward were simply \"dark and stupid humour\". He said he had been \"trying to make a serious point in a provocative way\".Barton, who has 2.7 million followers on X, also claimed his posts about Vine were merely \"crude banter\" and that in using the phrase \"bike nonce\" he had never intended to imply the radio presenter was a paedophile.Jurors cleared Barton on a charge relating to a post containing a mock apology to Aluko for comparing her to Rose West.That post went on to say: \"She's clearly in the Joseph Stalin/Pol Pot category.\"She's murdered hundreds of thousands if not millions of football fan's [sic] ears, in the last few years.\"'A little bully'However, the jury did convict Barton over a post in which he said ITV pundit Aluko was \"only there to tick boxes\".\"All off the back of the [Black Lives Matter]/George Floyd nonsense,\" he added. Barton was cleared of writing that Ward and Aluko were the \"Fred and Rose West of football commentary\" after an FA Cup tie in January 2024 between Crystal Palace and Everton.But the former Fleetwood and Bristol Rovers manager was convicted of a count relating to another post in which he superimposed their faces onto a photograph of the serial killers.He was also convicted over posts suggesting Vine had visited \"Epstein island\" - a reference to the paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein - and one saying: \"If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.\"In his closing speech to the jury of seven men and five women, prosecutor Peter Wright KC said Barton had crossed the line \"by some considerable margin\" beyond what is tolerable in society.He said Barton was not \"the victim here\" and called the footballer: \"A little bully who takes pleasure sitting there with his phone in his hand and then posting these slurs.\"'Grossly offensive'Directing the jury, Judge Menary explained that the term \"grossly offensive\" in the charges required a \"high bar\" for conviction.\"The criminal law is not there to punish bad manners, sharp humour, or unpopular opinions,\" he said. \"The law only intervenes when the content is of such an extreme, degrading or dehumanising character that society as a whole would say 'that goes too far, that crosses the line of what we can tolerate'.\"Barton was released on bail and Judge Menary ordered a pre-sentence report be prepared.The judge also warned him it would be \"very foolish\" to post anything on social media about the case before then.Senior Crown Prosecutor Callum Bryce, of CPS Mersey-Cheshire, said Barton had \"subjected three public figures to offences of malicious communications\".\"In his evidence before the court [Barton said] that in some of his messages he was trying to make a serious point in a provocative way and that in others he was simply joking,\" he said.\"The finding of the jury confirmed that his conduct had gone beyond any joke and his messages were grossly offensive with the purpose of causing anxiety and distress to his victims.\"More on this story",

The group were among 47 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's proposed cuts to welfare in July and forced ministers to water down their plans.The rebellion undermined Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's authority, which was weakened after a series of policy reversals, including restoring the Winter Fuel Payment to millions of pensioners.At the time of their suspension, Starmer said he was \"determined\" to change the country \"for the better\". He said: \"Therefore, we have to deal with people who repeatedly break the whip.\"Hinchliff said he welcomed the whip back and added he had \"constructive discussions\" with the new chief whip in recent months.PA MediaNeil Duncan-Jordan says he will continue to work hard for his Poole constituentsDuncan-Jordan said he was \"glad\" to have the whip restored. \"I've been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I'm pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.\"I'll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values - tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society,\" he added.  Maskell said she was \"grateful\" that she had been given the whip back. \"I recognise the heavy responsibility on Labour to repair our public services and economy after 14 disastrous years and above all to lift people out of poverty. \"With 4.5m children living in poverty tonight, I am focused on ensuring they have the very best start in life,\" she added. The move comes as the party faces a difficult month in government with growing concern among Labour MPs that taxes will have to rise in the upcoming budget. Newly elected Labour deputy leader, Lucy Powell, urged the government not to raise taxes in the next budget. Powell told the BBC the government \"should be following through\" on its manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national tax or VAT. More on this story",

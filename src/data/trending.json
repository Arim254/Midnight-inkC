    "body": "7 hours agoPaul AdamsDiplomatic correspondent, Jerusalem andRushdi AbualoufGaza correspondentBBCHow does a group that has governed the Gaza Strip for almost 20 years, ruling two million Palestinians with an iron rod and fighting Israel in repeated wars, suddenly lay down its arms and relinquish control?Judging by a steady stream of gruesome images emerging from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October, Hamas seems intent on reasserting its authority.Its masked men, back on the streets, have been seen beating and executing opponents. Impromptu firing squads have dispatched kneeling men they say are members of rival groups, including some of Gaza's powerful clans.Other victims, cowering in terror, are shot in the legs or beaten with heavy clubs.Some of those now being attacked by Hamas had been part of groups involved in looting and diverting aid, according to one aid worker I spoke to, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The UN has also accused criminal gangs of stealing aid.This is not yet a world in which, as US President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan envisages, Hamas fighters turn over their weapons, submit to an amnesty, leave Gaza and hand over to an international stabilisation force.AFP via Getty ImagesThe ceasefire came into effect on Friday 10 October​ - Hamas and Israel have both blamed each other for blatant violations of itFor his part, President Trump initially seemed ambivalent about the brutality.On his way to Israel on 13 October, he signalled the US had given Hamas - designated a terrorist group by the US, UK, Israel and others - a green light to restore order.\"We have given them approval for a period of time,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.Three days later, he hardened his tone. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"we will have no choice but to go in and kill them.\"So, where does this situation on the ground in Gaza today leave Hamas? And ultimately, after two years of war that has resulted in unparalleled suffering for its own people and the violent death of most of its key figures, what, if anything, does the future really hold for the group?'A complete loss of law and order'For many Gazans, traumatised and exhausted by two years of perpetual suffering - and a war that has killed 68,000 people in Gaza according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry - this ugly endgame is nerve-wracking, but doesn't come as a surprise.Of the Gazans I spoke to - among them, aid workers, lawyers, as well as a former adviser to a Hamas leader - each has a different take on the likelihood of Hamas laying down its arms and relinquishing control. And indeed - given the situation on the ground - whether now is the time for them to do so.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPalestinians gathered to celebrate following the announcement of the ceasefire agreement \"It's been two years with a complete loss of law and order,\" aid worker Hanya Aljamal says from her home in Deir al-Balah, in the middle of the Gaza Strip. \"We need someone to take over.\"As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs.\"Dr Ahmad Yousef, a former advisor to Ismail Haniyeh, who was Hamas's political leader, is of the opinion that a firm grip is needed at present.\"As long as there are still people who try to take the law into their hands, we need somebody to scare them and squeeze them to the corner,\" says Dr Yousef, who now runs a Gaza think tank and remains close to the Hamas leadership.'As unqualified as Hamas is to rule the Strip, they are a better option than the gangs,' argues aid worker Hanya Aljamal \"This will take time. Not a long time. Within a month we will host those police forces and soldiers from Turkey and Egypt,\" he continues, referring to the international stabilisation force for Gaza, outlined in the peace plan, that could be composed of troops from Egypt and Turkey, among others. \"This is the moment where they will set their guns aside.\"Other Gazans are more sceptical, and fearful. Some aren't convinced that Hamas will give up their power - or weapons at all.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer imprisoned several times by Hamas, is one of them. AFP via Getty ImagesMany Palestinians and Israelis doubt Hamas is willing to step back from a political roleHe has been in hiding since July, when he says masked Hamas gunmen came to his Gaza City apartment and ordered him to report to al-Shifa hospital for interrogation.\"Hamas is [sending] a message to the world and to President Donald Trump… that they will neither relinquish power nor hand over their weapons.\"If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head,\" he says in one of a series of videos sent to us from an undisclosed location in the Gaza Strip. The wall behind him is riddled with bullet holes.Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza-based lawyer: 'If I fell into Hamas' hands now, they would make a video and kill me in the street with a shot to the head'\"It is a gang, not a government,\" he says of Hamas. \"I don't want them to remain in Gaza… I don't want them in government, and I don't want them in security. I don't want to see their ideas spread in mosques, in the streets, or in schools.\"'Still the dominant player in Gaza'Mr al-Natour has his own take on what Gaza could look like.The disparate array of militias now under Hamas assault could, in his view, be integrated a new security apparatus. But with their competing agendas, sometimes murky pasts and, in some cases, controversial links to the Israeli military, it's a problematic proposition.\"The fact is – and sometimes it's very hard for Israelis to admit this – that Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza.\" says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military Intelligence.\"Relying on suspicious players - clans, militias, gangs, many of them criminals, many of them affiliated with ISIS [the Islamic State group], many of them involved in terror attacks against Israel - and considering them as a kind of alternative to Hamas is an illusion.\"'Hamas still exists and is the dominant player in Gaza' says Dr Michael Milshtein, a former head of the department for Palestinian Affairs in Israeli Military IntelligenceHamas officials have said the group is willing to hand over political control of Gaza. The Trump ceasefire plan, to which it gave its qualified support, envisages \"temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\".But even if the group is willing to step back from a political role – something many Palestinians and Israelis still doubt - persuading its battle-hardened fighters to lay down their weapons is a big step for an organisation whose power, even before October 2023, relied heavily on the force of arms.Rise of Hamas and its iron gripTo begin to answer the complex question of what may happen to Hamas next requires delving backwards into how exactly it consolidated power in the first place.From its origins in the 1980s as an offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and a rival to the secular Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Hamas morphed into a violent militant group responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians.Initially, Israel offered discreet support to Hamas, seeing it as a useful counterweight to the PLO and its dominant faction, Fatah, led at the time by Yasser Arafat.\"The major enemy was Fatah,\" says Ami Ayalon, former head of Israel's domestic security service, Shin Bet, \"because they were the people who demanded a Palestinian state.\"But when Hamas launched deadly suicide bomb attacks in the 1990s and 2000s on Israelis, Israel responded with a series of high-profile assassinations.A violent power struggle with Fatah left Hamas, which won a 2006 election, in sole control of the Gaza Strip.Eighteen years of Hamas rule have followed, characterised by an Israeli military and economic blockade, and bouts of armed conflict in 2008-09, 2012, 2014 and 2021.Despite Israeli claims since October 2023 that \"Hamas is ISIS\", the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously convinced itself that Hamas did not pose a strategic threat.\"His was a policy of managing the conflict,\" says Mr Ayalon. \"He said we are not going to solve it and we are totally against the reality of two states, so the only way is to divide and control.\"With Hamas in control in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas, ruling in part of the occupied West Bank, the Palestinians remained hopelessly divided, enabling Israel to argue that it had no unified leadership to negotiate peace with.\"[Netanyahu] did everything in order to support Hamas in Gaza,\" Mr Ayalon says. \"He let Qatar send them… more than $1.5bn.\"Getty ImagesIsrael has gone to enormous lengths to eliminate Hamas's key political and military figuresThe money from Qatar was meant to pay the wages of civil servants and support the poorest families, but security chiefs feared it was being used for other purposes.Mr Ayalon adds: \"It was clear to the director of the Shin Bet and the head of Mossad that this money would go to military infrastructure.Netanyahu has defended allowing payments to Hamas, saying it was meant to aid the civilian population.Hamas was always preparing for warAs 7 October brutally revealed, Hamas was always preparing for war. Nowhere was this more obvious than in its elaborate network of tunnels.Tunnels had already been used to mount attacks on Israeli army positions during the second Palestinian uprising, or \"Intifada\" that began in 2000.In 2006, Hamas fighters used a tunnel under the border with Israel to attack a military post near Kerem Shalom, killing two Israel soldiers and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. He was held for five years until his release, in 2011, in exchange for 1,027 Palestinian prisoners, including Yahya Sinwar, who would go on to mastermind the Hamas attacks of October 2023.Getty ImagesYahya Sinwar, one of those behind the Hamas attacks of October 2023Over time, Hamas' tunnel network expanded, to include workshops, weapons-manufacturing sites and command centres.Regional developments also played a role. In 2012, after the fall of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the brief rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas was able to smuggle increasingly sophisticated weapons into Gaza, including sniper rifles, mobile rocket launchers and equipment for the manufacture of long-range rockets.Hamas is thought to have benefitted from the help of technicians and fighters with experience of tunnelling in places like Lebanon and Iraq.Iran was also a key supporter, seeing Hamas as a natural component in its \"Axis of Resistance,\" a loose coalition of militant groups across the Middle East with a shared antipathy towards Israel and the United States.In 2020, a US State Department report said that Iran was providing around $100m a year to Palestinian militant groups including Hamas.Yousef Masoud/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesOver time, Hamas' tunnel network expandedSome tunnels were reportedly dug as deep as 230ft (70m) below ground, took years to build and cost tens of millions of dollars each. These were designed to protect senior Hamas commanders and house long-range weapons.A local expert with extensive knowledge of the tunnels told the BBC the cost of the entire project totalled roughly $6bn (£4.5bn).Precise figures are hard to come by, but it's thought that the scattered network extended for as much as 250 miles (400km), in a strip of land just 26 miles long and, at its widest, seven miles across.Tunnels: a project shrouded in secrecyPublic discussion of the tunnels - their location or cost - could expose Gazans to accusations of espionage, leading to arrest and worse. But many knew what was happening. Local residents would see the tell-tale signs: sand and clay being removed, new entrances appearing unexpectedly and machinery being brought in under cover of darkness.What began as an opportunistic response to Gaza's isolation became, over the span of three decades, a multi-layered subterranean industrial and military complex.It emerged later that much of it was concealed under Gaza's civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, schools and, in the case of a tunnel containing a Hamas data centre, the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza City.Anadolu via Getty ImagesAt least 67,938 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since since October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministryAfter 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostage, it also became a massive underground prison. Not all of those held hostage were concealed in tunnels, but many were, especially as the war ground on.Eli Sharabi, who became one of the most high profile of those taken, was first moved from a safe house into a tunnel after 52 of his 491 days in captivity. \"They tied us with ropes in our legs and hands,\" he told the BBC earlier this month. \"I fainted from time to time from the pain. One time they broke my ribs.\"By the time he was released, in February, he had lost more than 30kg (4st 10lb).EPAEli Sharabi, who was held hostage, was moved from a safe house into a tunnel. 'They tied us with ropes,' he has saidHamas used the hostages as bargaining chips, to secure ceasefires or the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. As negotiations over their fate continued, Hamas drip fed the Israeli public with a cruel series of videos, often showing the hostages in situations of extreme distress.Eventually it was, says Dr Yousef, internal and external pressure that forced Hamas to abandon the strategy.\"Qatar, Egypt and Turkey and also the people here in displacement camps sent a strong message to Hamas leaders outside that enough is enough.\"Getty ImagesIsrael assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024In the meantime, Israel continues to destroy what it can of the tunnel network, often demolishing civilian neighbourhoods above in the process.And the job is far from done.\"According to publications from the defence establishment, estimates speak of damage to between 25% and 40% of the tunnels,\" says Yehuda Kfir, an Israeli civil engineer and underground warfare researcher at Haifa's Technion University.\"No doubt [Hamas] aspires to rehabilitate the infrastructure, including restoring tunnels that were dealt with in various ways by the IDF.\"A leadership in tattersRestoring tunnels is one thing. Reconstituting the organisation is another. After the events of the past two years, Hamas' leadership is in tatters.Israel has gone to enormous lengths - in Gaza, Iran, Lebanon and Qatar - to eliminate the group's key political and military figures. From its best known, internationally recognisable leaders, travelling the world to promote their cause, to its battalion commanders on the ground in Gaza, Hamas has lost almost everyone of consequence.Israel assassinated Hamas's powerful leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Tehran in July 2024. Three months later, Haniyeh's successor, the elusive Yahya Sinwar, was killed in the ruins of a house in Rafah.ReutersIsmail Haniyeh (left) was assassinated in Tehran in July 2024, followed three months later by his successor Yahya Sinwar (centre). Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri (right) was killed in Beirut blastDespite the loss of these leading figures - and thousands of members of its armed wing - the group battled on, recruiting a fresh generation of radicalised young fighters and splintering into small cells intent on carrying out hit-and-run guerrilla-style operations.But Hamas in October 2025 is a pale shadow of the organisation that carried out the attacks of 7 October. Today's leaders are less well known and, crucially, have little political experience.Ezzedine al-Haddad, who is 55, now heads the five-member military council that commands Hamas' armed wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades.EPA/ ShutterstockMany of the group's key political and military figures have been killed. (L-R) Ismail Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Sheikh Ahmed YassinOutside Gaza, the remnants of the group's political leadership include Khaled Meshaal (the subject of a botched Israeli assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997), Khalil al-Hayya and Muhammad Darwish.All are believed to have escaped death on 9 September, when Israeli jets attacked a building in Doha, Qatar, where they were meeting to discuss the latest US ceasefire proposals.Hamas is 'tired of war'Despite the violence still raging in Gaza, the former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, says the group is tired of war. Without mentioning 7 October directly, he describes the cause of the war as a \"terrible mistake\" and that a \"different approach\" is needed.Anadolu via Getty ImagesPeople sit among the rubble and wreckage of war in Gaza. The former Hamas adviser, Ahmed Yousef, claims Hamas is also tired of war\"I'm talking to many of them and they have said that they are not interested in ruling Gaza anymore,\" he says. \"But Hamas has more than 100,000 members and those people are not going to disappear.\"Hamas, he suggests, is looking to rebrand itself in order to continue to play a political role in the future, a process he likens to the ANC's transition from guerrilla warfare to political rule in post-apartheid South Africa.\"If tomorrow there [are] elections,\" he says, \"I'm sure Hamas will come under different names, giving the impression it is more peaceful and more willing to be part of political life. \"Violence is not going to be part of any political party.\"Dr Milshtein is doubtful.\"Even if there will be a new local regime in Gaza, of course behind the scenes Hamas will be the dominant player,\" he argues.Anadolu via Getty ImagesIsrael may have to deal with Hamas for some time to comeDisarmament, he continues, is even less likely: he predicts another Gaza war within the next five years.But Ami Ayalon, the former Shin Bet chief, believes Israel should find another way to tackle its enemy.\"Unless we defeat the ideology, they will flourish,\" he says. \"The only way to defeat the ideology is by creating and presenting to the Palestinian and the Israeli people a new horizon. A horizon of two states.\"For now, that horizon does not exist, perhaps making Dr Milshtein's prediction more likely than Ami Ayalon's vision of a shared future.But Hamas, however diminished, is far from a spent force. One way or another, Israel may have to deal with it for some time to come.Top picture credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "South Korean police said they would seek an arrest warrant for a woman who set fire to her apartment building while trying to kill a cockroach with an improvised flamethrower, local media report.One of the woman's neighbours died after falling to the ground in a failed attempt to escape through a window.The woman, who is in her 20s, told police that she tried to torch a cockroach with a lighter and a flammable spray, adding she had used the method before. But on Monday, items in her home caught fire.Police in the northern city of Osan said the woman could be charged with accidentally starting a fire and causing death by negligence.Blasting cockroaches - with blowtorches or homemade flamethrowers - have emerged as a novel way of getting rid of house pests, made popular by videos on social media.In 2018, an Australian man set fire to his kitchen while trying to kill cockroaches with a homemade flamethrower made from insect spray.The woman who died in the Osan city fire, a Chinese national in her 30s, lived on the fifth floor of the building with her husband and two-month-old baby.When they realised that a fire had broken out, the couple opened their home window and called for help.They handed their baby through the window to a neighbour in the adjacent block, before trying to evacuate themselves.The woman's husband managed to climb over to the next block. She tried to do the same, but fell from the window. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead hours later.Police said they believed the couple had tried escaping through the window because thick smoke from the fire had blocked the stairway, local media report.The building houses commercial shops on its first floor and 32 residential units from its second to fifth floor.Eight other residents suffered from smoke inhalation because of the fire.",

    "body": "Virginia Giuffre would see Andrew giving up titles as a victory, co-author tells BBC5 hours agoEmily McGarveyGetty ImagesVirginia Giuffre would have viewed Prince Andrew giving up his titles \"as a victory\", the ghostwriter of her posthumous memoir told BBC Newsnight.The book, Nobody's Girl, co-written by Amy Wallace, describes Ms Giuffre's encounters with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell - and more details of her allegations about Prince Andrew, which he has always denied.In the memoir - released on Tuesday - Ms Giuffre described three occasions where she alleged Prince Andrew had sex with her.Ms Wallace spent four years writing the book with Ms Giuffre, who took her own life almost six months ago.In the book, Ms Giuffre said she had sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions. She says the third occasion was on Epstein's island as part of what Ms Giuffre called \"an orgy\" with Epstein and approximately eight other young women.Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, announced on Friday that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles including the Duke of York, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.He is also giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.But there are still calls for them to be formally removed.Ms Wallace said: \"I can speak for Virginia; I know that she would view it as a victory that he was forced, by whatever means, to voluntarily give them up.\"She called it a \"symbolic gesture\" which has made \"modern history in terms of the royal era\", describing it as \"a step in the right direction\".\"Virginia wanted all the men who she had been trafficked to, against her will, to be held to account, and this is just one of the men.\"Even though he (Andrew) continues to deny it, his life is being eroded because of his past behaviour, as it should be,\" Ms Wallace said.Watch: Ms Wallace, who spent four years writing the book with Ms Giuffre, spoke on her behalfMs Wallace went on to say there was a period when Prince Andrew \"indicated he was willing to help investigators in the US\" but he was \"never available, for some reason\".\"That's something he could still do. He could say, as he has repeatedly, 'I still deny that I was involved... however, I was in these houses and I was on that island and I was on the jet and I saw things, and I know how much these women have suffered and I would like to share what I saw,\" Ms Wallace said.Ms Wallace said the private jets used by Epstein \"had been remodelled in order to afford many bedrooms - they were designed as flying trafficking agents, they were there to use girls in\".She added: \"Prince Andrew was on at least one of those jets that I know of, if not more.\"He has to take sort of the measure of his own moral compass - he said in his settlement with Virginia that he now acknowledges the pain that these women and young girls had suffered. If you really feel it, do something about it.\"Speaking about Ms Giuffre, Ms Wallace said: \"I'm sad and I'm honoured to be able to speak at least a little bit on her behalf to stand up for her. \"She wrote this book to try to help other people, to make the world a better place. \"She deserves all credit for whatever role she played in forcing Prince Andrew to relinquish a few more of his titles but she deserves all credit even more than that for being brave enough to stand up to say 'this isn't right'.\"The memoir, which the BBC bought from a book store in central London days before its official release, paints a picture of a web of rich and powerful people abusing young women.At the centre of the abuse was Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.Ms Giuffre says that even decades later, she remembers how much she feared them both.Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a person under the age of 18. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv say they will not accept any ticket allocation from Aston Villa should the decision to ban their supporters from next month's Europa League match be overturned.Birmingham's Safety Advisory Group (SAG) - the body responsible for issuing safety certificates for matches - last week informed Villa no travelling fans would be permitted at the match in the city.The decision was widely condemned, with Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy pledging that the government will \"find the resources\" to allow Maccabi fans to attend earlier on Monday.But Maccabi Tel Aviv now say supporters will not travel for safety reasons - that \"a toxic atmosphere has been created which makes the safety of our fans wishing to attend very much in doubt\".A club statement said, external: \"The wellbeing and safety of our fans is paramount, and from hard lessons learned we have taken the decision to decline any allocation offered on behalf of away fans and our decision should be understood in that context.\"We hope that circumstances will change and look forward to being able to play in Birmingham in a sporting environment in the near future.\"\"We are deeply saddened Maccabi Tel Aviv have turned down their away fan allocation but we respect their right to do so,\" a government spokesperson said.They added it was \"completely unacceptable\" that the match has been \"weaponised to stoke violence and fear by those who seek to divide us\".\"The government has been working around the clock to defend a basic principle - that football fans should be able to enjoy a game without fear of intimidation or violence.\"On Thursday, West Midlands Police said it had classified the fixture as \"high risk\" based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including \"violent clashes and hate crime offences\" between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv fans before a match in Amsterdam, in November 2024.Nandy said ministers were working together to fund any necessary policing operation to allow away fans to attend, and the SAG would review the decision if West Midlands Police changed its risk assessment.Nandy said the matter was wider than matchday security, adding it came \"against the backdrop of rising antisemitism here and across the world, and an attack on a synagogue in Manchester in which two innocent men were killed\".On Sunday, the Israeli Premier League derby between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv was cancelled before kick-off, after what police described as \"public disorder and violent riots\".Maccabi say the decision to call that game off was not down to their supporters and thanked the UK government for its efforts.They said: \"We believe that football should be about bringing people together not driving them apart.\"Our fans regularly travel all over Europe without incident and to suggest that the reason our fans cannot be allowed to travel is due to their behaviour is an attempt to distort reality.\"We acknowledge the efforts of the UK government and police to ensure both sets of fans can attend the match safely, and are grateful for the messages of support from across the footballing community.\"Aston Villa previously told their matchday stewards they did not have to work at the Maccabi Tel Aviv fixture, saying they understood some \"may have concerns\".Following Thursday's announcement by the club about the impending fixture, Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the move \"wrong\" and said: \"We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets.\"",

    "body": "7 hours agoMark Lowen andAlison RobertsLisbonA preliminary report into last month's funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people has detailed a litany of failings.Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigations Bureau said an underground cable - which acted as a counterweight between two carriages and broke, causing the crash - was defective and had never been certified for passenger transportation. It said the cable was not technically suitable and was acquired in 2022 by Carris, the company running Lisbon's public transport that now says it has dismissed its head of maintenance of furniculars and trams.The 140-year-old Glória funicular, popular with tourists, derailed and crashed into a building on 3 September.There were 11 foreigners among those killed, including the three British nationals, while another 20 people were injured.The preliminary report, released on Monday, said there had been no oversight by Carris engineers and the cable was not tested before it was installed. The supervision and maintenance of the funicular by a company outsourced by Carris also did not work properly - apparently giving the Glória funicular the all-clear on the morning of the disaster, though it is not certain if the check actually took place that day.The emergency brake system, which the driver correctly tried to apply when the cable snapped, did not function properly and was never tested in advance, the report said.However, the preliminary report emphasised that the information gathered to date was \"incomplete\", with further tests and analysis needed.\"The guilt or responsibility of any organisation or person involved in the incident should not be presumed,\" it said.Lisbon's Mayor Carlos Moedas, who was re-elected on 12 October despite opposition accusations he had failed in his duty of oversight over the city's funiculars, told SIC television that the report \"reaffirms that the unfortunate tragedy... was due to technical and not political causes\".Carris issued a statement stressing it was \"not possible at this time to state whether or not the non-conformities in the use of the cable are relevant to the accident\", referring to a passage in the report that notes the same cables had been in use on the Glória funicular for 601 days without incident.According to the accident report: \"At this point in time, it cannot be said whether the use of this type of non-compliant cable intervened, or what intervention it had, in the rupture... and it is certain for the investigation that there were other factors that had to intervene.\"The company stressed that, though the cables had been brought into use under the current board of directors, who took office in May 2022, the acquisition process took place under the previous board.Among other safety recommendations to be further detailed are that Carris implement a new safety management system in line with European best practice.The full report will take about 11 months to complete. If that is delayed, a more detailed interim report will be released instead.Meanwhile, all Lisbon cable cars have been ordered to be out of service until the necessary safety checks are put in place. All braking systems need to be reviewed to see if they can stop the carriages if the cable fails - which had not been the case in the Glória accident - the report advised.It also recommended closing a loophole whereby Lisbon's historic funiculars are exempt from legal and supervisory oversight that applies to other cable-driven forms of transport.",

(When my leg is better),\" the 66-year-old added.BBC/PAThe actor had only just returned to the show, after missing his week three performance due to an illness.\"I had a little bit of a turn, a little bit of an episode with vertigo,\" he said during an appearance on companion programme Strictly: It Takes Two.\"But it was all OK, I made myself right again with the help of some good people at the hospital,\" he added.Dennis's return, in week four of the show on Saturday, saw him and Buswell secure their highest score of the series - performing a Charleston to the song Dance Monkey by Australian musician Tones and I.Strictly judge Shirley Ballas said Dennis had come \"back with a bang\", and that he had pushed his limits with a difficult routine.The pair are scheduled to be interviewed on Strictly: It Takes Two on Wednesday.Dennis is best known for playing Paul Robinson in Neighbours, the longest-running character in Australian television history.Following his first appearance in 1985, he went on to feature in 6,000 episodes across four decades.His partner Buswell made history this Strictly series - becoming the first professional dancer to compete on the show while pregnant.\"I'm still doing everything I did before,\" she said ahead of the beginning of the series.Speaking on her podcast Winning Isn't Everything, she added: \"Obviously with lifts there's going to be a bit more caution. But my doctor has said everything is normal.\"More on this story",

    "body": "Amazon outage 'resolved' as Snapchat and banks among sites impacted40 minutes agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporter andLily JamaliNorth America Technology CorrespondentGetty ImagesAmazon Web Services (AWS) said late Monday that it had resolved a massive outage that knocked some of the world's largest websites offline for much of the day.More than 1,000 apps and websites - including social media platforms like Snapchat and banks such as Lloyds and Halifax - were impacted by problems that Amazon said were at the heart of the cloud computing giant's operations in the US.The platform outage monitor Downdetector said user reports of problems globally soared to more than 11 million during the outage on Monday.Even after Amazon fixed the underlying problem, experts said the outage demonstrated the perils of having so many companies rely on a single, dominant provider.\"What this episode has highlighted is just how interdependent our infrastructure is,\" said Prof Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey.\"So many online services rely upon third parties for their physical infrastructure, and this shows that problems can occur in even the largest of those third-party providers.\"Small errors, often human made, can have widespread and significant impact.\"The issues appear to have begun at around 07:00 BST on Monday, as users began to report problems accessing a slew of platforms.This included a wide range of different sites and services, from massive online games like Fortnite to the language-learning app Duolingo.Early in the day, Downdetector told the BBC it had seen more than four million reports from users across 500 sites within just a few hours - more than double the amount it would see across an entire regular weekday.These later peaked at more than 11 million, it said, as more services including Reddit and Lloyds Bank attempted to recover.At around 2300 BST, Amazon said all AWS services had \"returned to normal operations.\"But not before the company had to throttle parts of its own system in order to address the root issue.A new series of \"cascading failures\" may have arisen after the initial outage, according to Mike Chapple, an information technology professor at Notre Dame University.\"It's like when you have a large-scale power outage. Crews start working to try to bring it back on line,\" Mr Chapple said. \"The power might flicker a few times,\" he explained, but it's possible Amazon had initially \"only addressed the symptoms\" and not the cause.What went wrong?Amazon has not yet fully detailed what caused Monday's outage or issued an official statement regarding it.It said in an update on its service status web page the issue \"appears to be related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoint in US-EAST-1\".DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, is often likened to a phone book for the internet.It effectively translates the website names people use (like bbc.co.uk) into numbers which can be read and understood by computers.This process basically underpins the way we use the internet, and disruptions to it can leave web browsers unable to locate the content they are looking for.Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, told the BBC the AWS outage highlighted the power cloud services have over how the internet works.\"Everyone has a bad day, today Amazon had a bad day,\" he said. \"There are amazing things about the cloud, it allows you to scale… but if you have an outage like this it can take down a lot of services we rely on.\"And Cori Crider, head of the Future of Technology Institute, told the BBC it was \"a bit like a bridge collapsing\".\"An essential part of the economy has fallen to pieces,\" she said.And with so much of cloud computing relying on Amazon, Microsoft and Google - estimated at around 70% - she said the status quo was \"unsustainable\".\"Once you have a concentrated supply in a handful of monopoly providers, when something like this falls over, it takes a huge percentage of the economy out with it,\" she said.\"We should really look at trying to buy more local services, rather than relying on a handful of American monopoly platforms.\"That's a risk to our security, our sovereignty and our economy and we need to look at structural separations to make our markets more resilient to these kind of shocks.\"Watch: BBC's Lucy Woodham asks Cardiff students about Snapchat outageOne computer science expert says some of the responsibility rests with the companies that use AWS.\"Companies using Amazon haven't been taking enough adequate care to build protection systems into their applications,\" says Ken Birman, a computer science professor at Cornell University in New York.Outages like the one on Monday occur frequently, although not always at this scale.Birman tells the BBC that app developers should take care to invest in backing up mission-critical applications that live in the cloud.\"We know how to make these systems stronger, and we know how to do it securely,\" Birman says.The question of responsibility could well land in the courts.More than a year after the massive CrowdStrike outage, Delta Airlines is still wrangling with the company to recover more than $500m in losses.Even after CrowdStrike had fixed the issue, the airline said it had to manually reset 40,000 servers, leading to major flight delays over several days.Additional reporting by Esyllt Carr.",

    "body": "Thousands of criminals could be released early under government sentencing reform, Tories say3 hours agoSima KotechaSenior UK correspondent andYang TianThe Conservatives say more than 2,000 prisoners serving sentences for rape, stalking and grooming will have their jail time cut because of the government's new sentencing plan.The opposition party has tabled an amendment to the sentencing bill - which is in the House of Commons for the second reading on Tuesday - to make sure offenders of the most serious crimes stay locked up for longer.Shadow justice minister Kieran Mullan has called the government's plan \"a betrayal of victims\", while Labour have accused the Tories of \"rank hypocrisy\" after they left prisons \"at breaking point\".The sentencing review recommends releasing some offenders earlier from prison if they have behaved well.The review set up to look at alternative punishments to jail after prisons became dangerously overcrowded.It recommends offenders on a fixed length prison term could be released after serving a third of their sentence, providing they behave well.Under this \"earned progression scheme\", prisoners released early will be monitored with enhanced supervision in the community, followed by a period on licence, which is unsupervised.The Conservatives have said in addition to more than 2,000 serious offenders having their jail terms cut, Labour's changes will also benefit over 62% of jailed rapists.\"Keir Starmer is putting criminals before communities and letting predators out early,\" Mullan said.\"Under Labour's plans, thousands of the most serious would no longer be treated as such, an insult to thousands of victims across the country.\"The amendment tabled by the Tories wants to ensure offenders of the most serious crimes - including rape, sexual offences against children and grievous bodily harm - will not benefit from the government's early release scheme, a press release said.Early prisoner release plan worries police chiefBBC In-Depth: A scheme helped prevent sex offenders committing more crimes - then it closed. Why?But sentencing minster Jake Richards accused the Conservatives of \"feigned outrage\" and said the government is \"cleaning up the mess\" left by the Tories.\"The Conservatives' rank hypocrisy is shameful. They built this crisis, then feigned outrage when the consequences arrived,\" he said.\"They took our prisons to breaking point, released thousands of serious offenders early and pushed Britain to the brink of a situation where police could no longer make arrests and courts could no longer prosecute.\"Labour have said the worst offenders - those on extended fixed sentences or life sentences - will never benefit from early release.President of the Prison Governors' Association Tom Wheatley said successive governments have failed to deliver the prison spaces needed to deal with dangerous overcrowding.\"The sentencing bill seeks to address this issue by reducing the amount of time offenders will spend in custody,\" he said.\"The alternatives are either spending more taxpayers money on building and running prisons or to continue to release prisoners earlier than the courts intended, as both this government and  previous Conservative governments have done.\"Other amendments to the sentencing bill proposed by the Tories include requiring courts to collect and publish detailed data on sentencing, making judges' remarks available to the public within two days, and extending the time victims have to challenge lenient sentences.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSakshi Venkatraman,Kwasi Asiedu andBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Construction begins in the East Wing of the White HouseParts of the White House's East Wing have been demolished, as construction begins on US President Donald Trump's new ballroom. Construction crews on Monday tore down massive chunks of a covered entryway and windows in the East Wing, which Trump said is being \"fully modernised\".The president previously said that his $250m (£186m) White House ballroom addition would be \"near\" the existing structure but would not change it. \"It won't interfere with the current building. It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it - and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said in July. \"It's my favourite. It's my favourite place. I love it.\"Trump announced the construction in a social media post, saying \"ground has been broken\" on the \"much-needed\" ballroom space. \"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State Visits, etc,\" he wrote. BBC/Bernd Debusmann JrThe East Wing of the White House on MondayReutersHe said the project is being privately funded by \"many generous Patriots\". Their identities are unclear still as the White House has not released any names of who might be funding it.The White House has served as the historic home of the US president for two centuries. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and was last modified in 1942.From the south side of the building, the BBC saw several large pieces of construction equipment - some adorned with US flags - near the East Wing.Trump wrote in his post that the East Wing was \"completely separate\" from the White House, though it is attached to the main structure. The covered entryway, which spans much of the East Wing's south side, appeared as though it was being gutted, with concrete debris and metal cables clearly visible from several hundred metres.ReutersControversy and preserving historyThough the White House and its adjoining parks are administered by the National Park Service (NPS), the president generally has broad powers to make renovations. Robert K Sutton, former chief historian of the NPS, told the BBC that there is always public concern when the White House goes under construction. \"There has been controversy with anything going on related to the White House pretty much since it was built,\" he said.The NPS has guidelines and a rigorous review process for any construction.  That includes things like reviewing in-depth plans for a project, vetting the architect and designs and reviewing the costs.That – he said – hasn't been done here.\"This building is so important. It's considered, I think, to be the most important executive building in the world – yet we just don't know what's happening and I think that's very inappropriate.\"Mr Sutton noted that figures for how many people the new ballroom can host have been tossed around, ranging from 600 to more than 900.The White House has released some information on the project, including drawings that give a sense of its scale and a new interior that includes seating for hundreds and decadent gold chandeliers. It said that construction would begin in September and Trump had met with those at the National Parks Service and the US Secret Service, among others, about the project. The Trump administration said it selected Clark Construction to head the project, with McCrery Architects designing it. The White House has said the Secret Service \"will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications\" to the building. \"I am honored that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People's House, while preserving the elegance of its classical design and historical importance,\" McCrery Architects head Jim McCrery said.Sutton said an extensive review process is typically in place for projects like this to ensure there is functionality to any changes, and that the White House sticks to its iconic appearance - noting these changes will outlive presidents and generations.He said he worried that this process is being rushed and will be a reflection of Trump and his signature style instead of the country's history. \"It's always been called the People's House,\" he said.Trump has installed a number of changes at the White House this year, including re-decorating the Oval Office with a variety of gold decor and paving over the grass in the Rose Garden with concrete to add tables and chairs.Presidents from Obama to Truman have made changesThe new White House renovation project has also been criticised by the Society of Architectural Historians, an international non-profit group that studies the preservation of historic buildings worldwide. In a statement last week, the group said it \"expresses great concern over the proposed ballroom additions\", which it notes, \"will be the first major change to its exterior appearance in the last 83 years (since the East Wing in its current form was built in 1942). \"Therefore, such a significant change to a historic building of this import should follow a rigorous and deliberate design and review process.\"The American Institute of Architects has also expressed alarm, and called for a transparent review of the project.But Trump is certainly not the first president to leave his mark on the building. President Barack Obama, who preceded Trump, had the White House tennis court converted to be able to also host basketball games. The White House swimming pool was converted to the White House Press Room during Richard Nixon's presidency. Briefings now still regularly take place in the room where presidents once swam laps. The indoor pool had originally been installed in 1933 for President Franklin D Roosevelt, who swam regularly for exercise due to a polio diagnosis more than a decade earlier.After it closed, Gerald Ford had an outdoor pool installed in 1975.Before that, one of the biggest renovations came under Harry Truman, who saw the complete gutting and rebuilding of the White House from 1948 to 1952. Truman was relocated from living at the White House during the extensive project. ",

Elsewhere, the Daily Mail questions Andrew's finances as the paper reports \"the disgraced prince 'did not' receive a significant inheritance from late Queen or Queen Mother\".  The front page also pictures one of his daughters driving reportedly to his home alongside the caption: \"Now Beatrice and Eugenie face a test of family loyalty\".The Times also headlines on the prince's tenancy, claiming that he \"has not paid rent since 2003\". According to terms of the leasehold agreement the paper has seen, he has paid \"one peppercorn (if demanded)\" in rent a year for two decades.More claims about Prince Andrew from Virginia Giuffre's book lead the Guardian. In its prominent picture slot, the paper shares a snap of King Charles in Manchester as he visited those affected in a synagogue attack last month. The Guardian says the King is \"under pressure to act further against Andrew\".Metro\"Something went wrong\" headlines the Metro in a glitchy font after many of the world's biggest websites and apps were disrupted. It describes \"online havoc across the globe\" including at UK banks and firms.The Daily Telegraph leads on the grooming inquiry after two survivors quit a liaison panel on Monday. The paper says critics are accusing Labour of \"sabotage\" with the prime minister urged to launch a new judge-led inquiry. A Home Office spokesman said it was \"committed to delivering a robust, thorough inquiry\".The news of a \"revolutionary bionic chip\" helping blind patients get their sight back leads The i Paper. The chip will enable people who have lost their vision to read again thanks to a \"2mm electronic eye implant\", according to The i. Scientists are hailing the technology as a \"paradigm shift\", it says, adding that it \"could become available on NHS\".The Daily Express leads on an employment tribunal in which a group is challenging a health trust's policy about female changing rooms at work. It says the women have been seen together for the first time.The Sun reports Katie Price's former husband Kieran Hayler has been charged with three counts of rape and one count of sexual assault against a 13-year-old.

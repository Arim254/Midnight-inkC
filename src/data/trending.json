    "body": "2 hours agoCachella SmithReutersRussell Brand has been charged with two further offences including one count of rape, the Metropolitan Police has said.In a new statement, the police force said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has authorised an additional charge of rape and a charge of sexual assault relating to two further women. The broadcaster, comedian and actor previously pleaded not guilty to five charges including two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault in relation to four women.Mr Brand, 50, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 20 January 2026 in relation to the two new charges.Detectives began investigating allegations into Mr Brand which came to light following reporting from the Sunday Times, the Times and Channel 4's Dispatches in September 2023.The two new charges allegedly took place in 2009 and relate to separate women, the CPS said.A trial is set to start at Southwark Crown Court on 16 June 2026 for the five original charges which allegedly took place on dates spanning between 1999 and 2005 in central London and Bournemouth.Mr Brand, of Oxfordshire, is accused of raping one woman in Bournemouth in 1999, and indecently assaulting another in the Westminster area in 2001.A third charge alleges he sexually assaulted a woman in Westminster between 2004 and 2005, while the remaining counts relate to the alleged oral rape and sexual assault of an additional woman in 2004 in the Westminster area Det Ch Insp Tariq Farooqi from the Metropolitan Police has said the women who have made reports are receiving support from specially trained officers.Mr Brand, who was born in Essex, rose to fame as a stand-up comedian and became a household name as host of TV shows like Big Brother's Big Mouth, and with his own radio programmes on stations including BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music.He went on to establish a Hollywood career, starring in films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him To The Greek.",

    "body": "7 hours agoIan AikmanPA MediaAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor is understood to have voluntarily surrendered his gun licence after a visit from the Metropolitan Police.Officers attended the former prince's Royal Lodge residence in Windsor last month, ahead of his expected house move in the new year.A Met Police spokesperson said: \"On Wednesday, 19 November, Metropolitan Police firearms licensing officers attended an address in Windsor to request that a man in his 60s voluntarily surrender his firearms and shotgun certificate.\" The force said the certificate was surrendered but did not comment further.It is not clear why the former prince - a known hunting enthusiast - gave up his licence, but the decision means he can only use or transport his guns if supervised.Surrendering a certificate does not mean the individual will not have access to their firearms.Andrew is expected to move to Norfolk in the new year, after he was stripped of his titles over his links to the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.The former prince will move to an undisclosed property on the Sandringham estate, which is privately owned by his brother, King Charles III.In October, Buckingham Palace said the move would take place \"as soon as possible and practicable\".Andrew's connection to Epstein came under scrutiny again last week after a photo of him lying on the laps of women was released by the US government as part of the Epstein files.The King's brother was one of many well-known figures to be pictured in the files, and appearing in them is not evidence of a crime. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.",

    "body": "3 hours agoIan YoungsCulture reporterA judge has quashed a private prosecution brought by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) against comedian Reginald D Hunter, saying it was intended to get him \"cancelled\".The CAA's prosecution accused the US stand-up comic, 56, of sending offensive messages on three occasions in August and September 2024.On Tuesday, District Judge Michael Snow quashed a summons for Hunter, ruling that the CAA was seeking to use the criminal justice system for \"improper reasons\".\"The CAA have demonstrated by the misleading and partial way in which it summarised its application and its wilful, repeated, failure to meet its disclosure obligations, that its true and sole motive in seeking to prosecute Reginald Hunter is to have him cancelled,\" he wrote.\"I have no doubt that the prosecution is abusive,\" Judge Snow added at the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court.\"My view of the conduct of the CAA is consistent with them as an organisation which is not 'playing it straight' but is seeking to use the criminal justice system, in this case for improper reasons.\"Hunter, who is known for his appearances on TV shows like Have I Got News For You and 8 Out of 10 Cats, wrote on Instagram \"I sure hope I'm employable again!\" and thanked his legal team.He was accused of sending an offensive communication on three occasions to Heidi Bachram on X on 24 August and 10 and 11 September last year.However, the judge said the CAA's application for a private prosecution had been \"wholly inadequate\" when it came to disclosing her social media activity towards him.\"It did not reveal the extent of her tweets directed against Reginald Hunter in the period immediately preceding the complaints (her tweets were sent between 15 August and 11 September 2024),\" he said.\"The summary misled me into believing that his comments were addressed to her involvement with the Jewish faith as opposed to his response to attempts that were being made to have him 'cancelled'.\"The judge added that the CAA had failed to inform him of a compliance investigation by the Charity Commission into the organisation in November 2024.Hunter's lawyer, Rebecca Chalkley KC, told a hearing on Tuesday: \"The CAA are weaponising and using the courts for their own political agenda and not just in this case.\"The CAA's prosecutor Donal Lawler told the hearing that the charity had complied with its duty of candour.In a statement, a CAA spokesperson said: \"We are of course deeply disappointed by the District Judge's decision.\"Our mission is, and always has been, to stand up for British Jews and their allies, particularly at a time when levels of antisemitism and antisemitic violence are rising at an alarming rate.\"Our lawyers are examining the ruling and considering our next steps.\"Private prosecutions are cases brought to criminal courts without the involvement of the police or CPS.",

The trove consists of thousands of documents related to the late sex-offender. Pictures include the former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor - Britain's former prince, musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. The justice department did not release all existing files, and the published ones were heavily redacted, prompting frustrated reactions from survivors of Epstein's abuse.\nAlso: the US carries out dozens of strikes against the Islamic State group in Syria.

    "body": "3 hours agoGetty ImagesPolice launched an investigation after the band's performance at the Glastonbury FestivalAn investigation by Avon and Somerset Police into chants made during a Bob Vylan performance at Glastonbury has concluded no further action will be taken.\"We have concluded, after reviewing all the evidence, that it does not meet the criminal threshold outlined by the CPS for any person to be prosecuted,\" the force said in a statement.\"No further action will be taken on the basis there is insufficient evidential for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction.\"The investigation related to chants of \"death, death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]\" and other comments made during the band's performance on the West Holts Stage, which was also broadcast via a live stream on the BBC iPlayer.Following their Glastonbury appearance, the band were dropped from a number of festivals and performances including Radar Festival, a show at a German music venue and a US tour after their visas were revoked.Bob Vylan are a London-based English punk-rap duo, who formed in Ipswich in 2017. Bobby Vylan is the singer and guitarist, while Bobbie Vylan is the drummer. Both members use stage names to maintain their privacy and collectively refer to themselves as \"the Bobs\".As part of their enquiries into the chants, police said they conducted \"a voluntary police interview under caution\" with a man in his mid 30s in November.Officers said they also spoke to \"approximately 200\" members of the public to see if they had been the victim of a criminal offence.Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement it had also sought legal precedents from other UK police forces that have dealt with similar incidents and advice from the National Police Chiefs' Council hate crime leads, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and \"an independent barrister\".\"We sought specific consideration around the words stated, in terms of the intent behind them, the wider context of how people heard what was said, case law and anything else potentially relevant, including freedom of speech,\" the statement continued.'Jewish communities consulted'\"Consistently the advice we have received has highlighted fundamental evidential difficulties that cannot be ignored,\" police said.\"The comments made on Saturday 28 June drew widespread anger, proving that words have real-world consequences.\"\"We believe it is right this matter was comprehensively investigated, every potential criminal offence was thoroughly considered, and we sought all the advice we could to ensure we made an informed decision.\"\"We have proactively engaged with a number of groups, particularly among our Jewish communities, since this incident and provided updates to them throughout.\"Police confirmed that the man that was interviewed as part of their investigation has already been informed of the outcome.It comes after the Met Police said it was closing its investigation into a London performance, following advice from the CPS.'Offensive and deplorable'The performance on the afternoon of 28 June sparked widespread backlash, with Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer describing the chants as \"appalling.\"In September, the BBC's complaints units partially upheld complaints about the controversial performance.It found that the broadcast broke editorial guidelines in relation to harm and offence but was cleared of breaching rules on impartiality and being likely to encourage or incite crime.BBC chairman Samir Shah said the decision not to pull the live feed after they made the on-stage comments was \"unquestionably an error of judgement\".Former director general Tim Davie went on to apologise, saying: \"I deeply regret that such offensive and deplorable behaviour appeared on the BBC.\"A small number of senior BBC staff stepped back from their day-to-day duties on music and live events after the festival.At the time, Glastonbury Festival issued a statement saying they were \"appalled by the statements,\" and said that the comments \"very much crossed the line\".After the festival, Bob Vylan said in a statement: \"We are not for the death of Jews, Arabs or any other race or group of people. We are for the dismantling of a violent military machine.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "7 hours agoJames W KellyLondonPA MediaThe protest was in support of Palestine Action prisoners on hunger strikeGreta Thunberg has been arrested at a demonstration in support of the Palestine Action protesters who are on hunger strike in prison, according to the Prisoners for Palestine protest group.The 22-year-old activist was detained in the City of London after attending the scene of the early-morning demonstration on Fenchurch Street.In a video shared by the group, she could be seen holding a sign reading \"I support the Palestine Action prisoners\" and \"I oppose genocide\".City of London Police said a 22-year-old woman was arrested, and later bailed, for displaying a placard in support of a proscribed organisation, in this case Palestine Action, contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.The force said officers were called to the area at about 07:00 GMT after hammers and red paint were used to damage a building.A man and a woman were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage after they \"glued themselves nearby\", police said. Specialist officers worked to release them before taking them into custody.PA MediaMs Thunberg has been a prominent voice in Europe's pro-Palestinian movementThe Prisoners for Palestine protest group said it staged the demonstration outside the offices of Aspen Insurance, which it claimed provides services to Israeli-linked defence firm Elbit Systems.Palestine Action was proscribed under UK terrorism legislation earlier this year, making it a criminal offence to support or express support for the group.Police said inquiries were continuing.Ms Thunberg, who first came to prominence as a child climate activist, has been involved in several demonstrations in support of the Palestinian cause.She described the activists on hunger strike as \"political prisoners\" in a video posted on her Instagram on Monday, adding the UK government should meet their demands to be released from custody and for charges to be dropped.PA MediaProtesters targeted an office in the City with red paintThe protest comes after several imprisoned Palestine Action activists, including one who has refused to eat for 52 days, have been taken to hospital in recent days.Since the hunger strike began on 2 November, a total of seven prisoners have been taken to hospital.Kamran Ahmed, 28, who was being held at Pentonville Prison in north London, was admitted to hospital in the past week, as was Amu Gib, 30, who was being held at HMP Bronzefield in Surrey.The latter's health had \"deteriorated rapidly\" since joining the hunger strike on 2 November, and the activist now needed to use a wheelchair, Prisoners for Palestine previously said.A legal firm representing the hunger strikers has said it submitted a pre-action letter on Monday against the Justice Secretary David Lammy.The letter outlines the group's intention to initiate legal action.

Ranger wanted for uninhabited Scottish island7 hours agoGetty ImagesHanda is a 760-acre island of the Highlands' north west coastA new ranger is being sought for a tiny uninhabited island in the north west Highlands.The six-month role with the Scottish Wildlife Trust (SWT) comes with a few challenges - including weekly trips by boat to the mainland to do laundry and buy supplies.A good knowledge of wildlife is required for the job, while excellent people skills are highly desirable.\"Handa is an isolated location and the people you work with will also be the people you socialise with in the evening, so it needs to be someone that's comfortable with communal living,\" said SWT reserves area manager Rab Potter. The 760-acre (307ha) island is reached from the mainland by a 10-minute passenger ferry from Tarbet, a small community a few miles from Scourie, which itself is home to only about 200 people.Handa's last human inhabitants left in the 19th Century, leaving the island to its tens of thousands of seabirds such as puffins, guillemots and razorbills.Whales and basking sharks are often spotted from the shore.The ranger post, which comes with a £26,112 salary, involves monitoring the wildlife, leading a team of volunteers - and helping to manage the island's 8,000 summer visitors.Getty ImagesHanda's last human inhabitants left in the 19th Century\"The perfect candidate is someone who can not only lead a team of volunteers but also live alongside them,\" Mr Potter said.\"They need to be resourceful, able to find solutions to any unexpected problems and be able to plan around the changeable weather as sometimes it can mean no ferries for days at a time. \"A good knowledge of monitoring wildlife, in particular seabirds, is also a requirement.\"He added: \"It's a challenging role, but the successful candidate will spend some warm, sunny days in one of the most beautiful and exciting places in Scotland.\"Accommodation is provided free of charge  in a purpose-built rangers bothy.But frequent visits would be needed to Scourie for washing, shopping and supplies of bottled gas which is used as fuel for cooking and heating.The job runs from March to September next year.Getty ImagesSWT said the role could challenging, but was also rewardingRelated internet links",

    "body": "5 hours agoLaura GozziFootage supplied by the team of scientists show the scale of the footprints and a recreation of how they were formedThousands of dinosaur footprints dating back 210 million years have been found in a national park in northern Italy.The footprints - some of which are up to 40cm (15in) in diameter - are aligned in parallel rows, and many show clear traces of toes and claws. It is thought the dinosaurs were prosauropods - herbivores with long necks, small heads and sharp claws. \"I never would have imagined I'd come across such a spectacular discovery in the region where I live,\" said Milan-based paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso.Illustrazione di Fabio Manucci, Arch. PaleoStelvioArtist's rendition of a herd of prosauropods walking across a muddy plain during low tide. Smaller footprints suggest the herd also included young specimensLast September a photographer spotted the footprints stretching hundreds of metres on a vertical mountain wall in the Stelvio national park, north-east of Milan.In the Triassic period - between about 250 and 201 million years ago - the wall was a tidal flat, which later became part of the Alpine chain.\"This place was full of dinosaurs; it's an immense scientific treasure,\" Mr Dal Sasso said.The herds moved in harmony, he added, \"and there are also traces of more complex behaviours, like groups of animals gathering in a circle, perhaps for the purposes of defence.\"The prosauropods, which could be up to 10m (33ft) long,  walked on two legs but in some cases handprints were found in front of footprints, indicating that they probably stopped and rested their forelimbs on the ground.Elio Della Ferrera, Arch. PaleoStelvioPhotographer Elio Della Ferrera snapped the first picture of the mountain wall showing the footprintsElio Della Ferrera, the photographer who discovered the site, said he hoped the discovery would \"spark reflection in all of us, highlighting how little we know about the places we live in: our home, our planet\".According to a press release from the Italian culture ministry, the area is remote and not accessible by paths, so drones and remote sensing technology will be employed instead.The Stelvio national park is located in the Fraele valley by Italy's border with Switzerland, near where the Winter Olympics will take place next year. \"It's as if history itself wanted to pay homage to the greatest global sporting event, combining past and present in a symbolic passing of the baton between nature and sport,\" said the Italian Ministry of Culture.",

    "body": "39 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterThe government has ordered an independent review into foreign financial interference in UK politics in response to what it called the \"shocking\" case of Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales. Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).Announcing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\".The review will be led by former senior civil Philip Rycroft and will report back in March. Speaking in the House of Commons, Reed said: \"The facts are clear. A British politician took bribes to further the interests of the Russian regime, a regime which forcefully deported vulnerable Ukrainian children and killed a British citizen on British soil using a deadly nerve agent.\"This conduct is a stain on our democracy. The independent review will work to remove that stain.\"Earlier this year the government published its strategy for \"modern and secure elections\", which Reed said \"will close loopholes that should have been closed long before we entered office\".\"However, in the time since that strategy was published, events have shown that we need to consider whether our firewall is enough,\" he added.He said the findings of the review would inform the government's Election and Democracy Bill, which it plans to publish next year.  The government said the review would conduct an \"in-depth assessment of the current financial rules and safeguards and offer recommendations to further mitigate risks from foreign political interference\".It will also examine whether rules are in place to \"protect our democracy from illicit money from abroad, including cryptocurrencies\".The government described the review as \"a response to the evolving threat posed by political interference to British democracy, including the shocking cases of former MEP Nathan Gill and Christine Lee\".In 2022, MI5 issued a rare warning alleging that Ms Lee was a Chinese agent who infiltrated Parliament and made donations to politicians. Ms Lee has previously said the MI5 alert \"wrongly accused her of knowingly engaging in political interference\" on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.Last month, Gill became the first politician to be jailed under the Bribery Act. He is thought to have received up to £40,000 to help pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.He was an MEP when he accepted money from Oleg Voloshyn, a man once described by the US government as a \"pawn\" of Russian secret services.Gill was an MEP for UKIP and the Brexit Party, before joining Reform UK, where he served for a brief period as its leader in Wales until May 2021.At the time of Gill's conviction Reform UK said it was glad justice was served, calling his actions \"reprehensible, treasonous and unforgivable\".Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Reed replied that the review could look into \"all potential sources of malign foreign financial interference\". Conservative shadow communities minister Paul Holmes also welcomed the review and said all political parties should be consulted during the inquiry.He called for better \"information sharing\" so political parties could more easily be able to \"identify irregular sources\" when accepting donations. Liberal Democrat spokesperson Zöe Franklin expressed concern that \"a small number of extremely wealthy individuals now wield disproportionate influence over British politics - that includes overseas donors\".She urged the government to introduce a cap on political donations. Plaid Cymru MP Ann Davies said her party had been \"calling for action in Westminster and the Senedd for months, only to be repeatedly dismissed by this Labour government\".She added: \"Unfortunately, because of the government's delay, there is now no time to implement reforms before the 2026 Senedd elections.\"Asked by reporters if the government was targeting Reform, a Downing Street spokesman said: \"No, this review isn't aimed at any specific party or individual.\"It's about protecting the integrity of our democratic system.\"The spokesman also said the review would focus on contemporary threats and recent cases but it would not consider previous allegations of interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum.

    "body": "Footballer who fled Taliban hopes to become 'Pakistani Haaland'4 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi de Souza,BBC NewsbeatZiyad BaigUmar Nawaz recently made his debut for PakistanUmar Nawaz was just seven years old when his world was turned upside down by a deadly terrorist attack in Pakistan.Umar thought he was \"dreaming\" after hearing his big brother Haris was among the 141 killed by the Pakistan Taliban in the Army Public School massacre in Peshawar on 16 December 2014.His other older brother, Ahmad, was shot in the arm, leaving him with an injury requiring emergency surgery.Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, the 6ft 3in (191cm) striker says: \"We had to come to the UK for his treatment and from there we thought the UK was the best place to stay.\"I didn't think Pakistan was safe to go back to.\"\"It was a sad moment for my family, especially for my mum and dad who lost their child.\"Eleven years on from the massacre, the 18-year-old is now a Wrexham FC Academy scholar who has just made his debut for Pakistan's national team.\"When I first came to Birmingham after seeing what happened to my brother I was traumatised, what if it happened again?\" he says.\"But when I went to school, I felt so safe, in the UK it is so safe and protective, I got really comfortable.\"Umar picked up English after just four months in primary school, and started playing football at his local park.\"I would buy cones and start practising basic skills like kick-ups and dribbling\" he recalls.He asked his parents to put him up for local football team, Bournville FC, where he was scouted for Premier League side Wolverhampton FC, before getting picked up by Wrexham FC.\"My style is like Haaland, I play a lot like him,\" says Umar, who is also a huge Manchester City fan.Umar jokes that his dad soon had him on a diet of 14 boiled eggs a day, chicken breast and rice, but the discipline soon led to his first international appearance, playing for Pakistan's international team against Syria in November.This required him to return to Pakistan for the first time - a bittersweet experience.\"It was a bit upsetting,\" he says. \"It was the place I lost my brother.\"But Umar was determined not to let his tragedy define him.\"I was going to go in. It's my country. It's a big moment,\" he says.\"My brother who passed away was probably really proud of me, I wish he was there to see my play for Pakistan.\"He would have been the first one in the crowd, my biggest supporter.\"While Umar \"can't remember much\" about his childhood in Peshawar one thing stands out – playing cricket with his two big brothers.\"I will always remember that, especially my brother that I lost,\" he says.\"He and I would always have a competition - of course he would always beat me, he was a really good cricketer.\"Getty ImagesUmar says his surviving brother Ahmad, pictured in 2015, is also an inspiration to himUmar says his surviving brother Ahmad has also inspired him.He says his sibling, who was the president of Oxford University's Union in 2022, is another \"role model\".\"He's pushed me a lot, all of us are proud of him, especially from what he's been through, getting shot in the arm,\" says Umar.Faith has also played a huge part in his journey. \"Even if I'm having a good game or bad game I will pray and thank God, it's good to stay connected to Allah in good or bad times,\" he says.Umar remains determined to continue to excel on the pitch, with hopes for more international appearances.\"In the future you'll see the Pakistani Haaland,\" he says.\"Hopefully get a few more call-ups for Pakistan, be the top goalscorer for Pakistan, that would be a great achievement. Good things are going to come.\"I can just focus on making my family and brother really proud.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "28 minutes agoNathan StandleyEducation reporterThe UK is set to rejoin the Erasmus scheme, the BBC understands, five years after announcing that it would end its participation as part of the Brexit deal with the European Union.The EU provides funding through the scheme for people to study, train or volunteer in other European countries for up to a year.The UK replaced it with its own Turing scheme in 2021, which funds similar placements worldwide.The government said it would not comment on ongoing talks.Prime Minister Keir Starmer had suggested in May that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU.Alex Stanley, from the National Union of Students (NUS), said it was \"fantastic that another generation of students will be able to be part of the Erasmus programme\", adding that it would represent \"a huge win for the student movement\".\"Students have been campaigning to rejoin Erasmus from the day we left,\" he said.The Erasmus scheme was scrapped in the UK in December 2020, when the government announced its post-Brexit trade deal with the EU.Boris Johnson, prime minister at the time, said it was a \"tough decision\", but the scheme had become \"extremely expensive\".He said it would be replaced by the Turing scheme, which has operated since then.Both schemes are open not just to university students, but also to people doing vocational courses, as well as apprentices and people training at college or school.In 2020, the last year in which the UK participated in Erasmus, the scheme received 144m euros (£126m) of EU funding for 55,700 people to take part in Erasmus projects overall.The UK sent out 9,900 students and trainees to other countries as part of the scheme that year, while 16,100 came the other way.Glasgow, Bristol and Edinburgh were the three universities to send the most students, and Spain, France and Germany were the most popular countries which UK students went to.In the 2024/25 academic year, the Turing scheme had £105m of funding, which paid for 43,200 placements, with 24,000 of those being in higher education, 12,100 in further education and 7,000 in schools.The majority (38,000) were from England, with 2,900 from Scotland, 1,000 from Wales and 1,200 from Northern Ireland.Ministers who introduced the Turing scheme in 2021 said it was designed to benefit more people from disadvantaged backgrounds and provide greater support for travel costs than the Erasmus scheme did.It is not yet clear what will happen to the Turing scheme once Erasmus is reintroduced for UK students.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSarah Turnnidge,West of England andBeth Cruse,West of EnglandA teenage boy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a nine-year-old girl.Avon and Somerset Police said officers were called to Lime Close in the Mead Vale area of Weston-super-Mare, North Somerset, at 18:09 GMT on Monday, where the girl was pronounced dead at the scene. The boy was arrested in nearby Worle at 18:19 and is currently in police custody. House-to-house inquiries are being carried out, with a police cordon in place. Supt Jen Appleford gave a statement on Lime Close on Tuesday afternoon.\"We know the whole of Weston-super-Mare will be distraught and shocked to learn of this utterly dreadful news,\" she said.Supt Appleford said the girl's family had been informed on Monday evening, adding: \"It is impossible for us to adequately put into words the pain and anguish they are feeling right now.\" An investigation is under way, with a post-mortem examination to be carried out. \"Out of respect for the family we'd please ask people not to speculate on the circumstances, or the identities, of those involved because that will only add to their enormous distress,\" Supt Appleford added. Residents said they feel \"shocked\" and \"horrified\" by what has happened.\"I was walking my dogs...I saw the police at the corner and as I glanced down the alleyway I saw some more police,\" said local resident Star Barzey.\"I'm horrified that a young child has been [killed], I mean that is shocking\".Glynis Field, who has lived in the area for 49 years, said: \"I've never seen so many police cars in all my life, and ambulances, armed police.\"To think that's right on our doorstep… It's awful, terrible, absolutely terrible.\"Margaret Jones, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said: \"The chances are that I would have seen her playing out, because a lot of the children round here play out here, it's a horrible thought.\"It saddens me… I find it sad that I may have spoken to her and known her.\"Police have asked the local community to remain \"patient\" as inquiries are carried out at the house and in the surrounding area.There will also be an increased police presence in the streets around the crime scene in the coming days, although Avon and Somerset Police stressed it was not aware of any risk to the wider public.",

    "body": "2 hours agoDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent Stephen Lawrence murderer David Norris has been denied parole.He had sought release during a parole hearing in October, having been jailed in 2012 over the 18-year-old's killing.Stephen was stabbed to death in a racist attack in south London in 1993. Police failings in the investigation into his killing made the case notorious and led to the Metropolitan Police being branded \"institutionally racist\" by a public inquiry.Only two of his killers - including Norris - have been convicted. Police have always maintained six people were involved.Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, said Norris remained \"a dangerous racist who should never be let out of prison\".She added: \"He was a coward who completely failed to acknowledge the life he took or the deep and lasting impact his actions have had on my family and me.\"Norris's parole bid came 13 years after he was jailed for life with a minimum sentence of 14 years and three months.Stephen was stabbed to death by a gang as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London. The case gained national attention as the Met failed to properly investigate the five prime suspects in the case, with only two - Norris and Gary Dobson - finally being convicted in 2012. The other suspects remain free.Norris admitted to being part of the attack at the hearing in October, but refused to name the other killers. He had previously denied involvement.He said he was the last person to punch Stephen. He had tried to hit him two or three times and one of his punches connected.For decades, Norris had publicly denied involvement in the murder, giving no-comment interviews to police and claiming he was innocent during his trial.However, the hearing heard confirmation that he had admitted involvement since being in prison, but denied stabbing Stephen or using a knife.Baroness Lawrence called his parole application \"a gross manipulation of the process\".She said in a statement after the parole board's decision that she had hoped the hearing would reveal who delivered the \"fatal blows\" to her son, but that she had been \"cruelly deprived of that knowledge\".Norris had put her through \"two days of anguish\" despite knowing he could have given her a \"crumb of comfort\", Baroness Lawrence, now a peer and a campaigner, said.\"It was evident that he showed no remorse for his actions or for the pain he had caused to my family and to those who cared for Stephen. My fight for justice is not over, but today's decision is a step in the right direction.\"Both she and the justice secretary had opposed Norris's release.An extreme racist slur had been used towards Stephen just before the gang attacked, according to witness evidence given at Norris's trial.Norris gave evidence to his parole hearing - in which he was bidding for release on licence - via a video link from prison.The hearing also heard Norris continued to use racist language in prison, with him having been recorded in 2022 using the same racial slur that was hurled at Stephen before the fatal stabbing.In a prepared statement that Norris read out, he apologised to the Lawrence family and wider black and ethnic community for the \"fear\" and \"horror\" his role in the attack had caused.In a statement read on her behalf, Baroness Lawrence said Norris had \"killed my son in the most brutal and callous fashion\".She said she could not forgive Norris because he has not \"expressed any acceptance, any contrition and certainly has no humanity\".Stephen's father previously told the BBC that Norris should name the other killers before he could be judged to be safe for release from prison.The Met Police ended its murder investigation in 2020, but a BBC investigation led to an independent review of the case, which began in September.",

    "body": "48 minutes agoTheo LeggettInternational Business CorrespondentThe European Commission has watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035.Current rules state that new vehicles sold from that date should be \"zero emission\", but carmakers, particularly in Germany, have lobbied heavily for concessions.Under the European Commission's new plan, 90% of new cars sold from 2035 would have to be zero-emission, rather than 100%.According to the European carmakers association, ACEA, market demand for electric cars is currently too low, and without a change to the rules, manufacturers would risk \"multi-billion euro\" penalties.The remaining 10% could be made up of conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids.Carmakers will be expected to use low-carbon steel made in the EU in the vehicles they produce.The Commission also expects an increase in the use of biofuels and so-called e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide, to compensate for the extra emissions created by petrol and diesel vehicles. Opponents of the move have warned that it risks undermining the transition towards electric vehicles and leaving the EU exposed in the face of foreign competition.The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate.\"The UK must stand firm. Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,\" said T&E UK's director Anna Krajinska.Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that \"flexibility\" for manufacturers was \"urgent\".\"2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,\" she said.\"It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments.\"Carmakers in the UK have previously called for better incentives to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets.Volvo said it had \"built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years\" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well.The carmaker said: \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. \"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it \"economically sound overall\".It said: \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles.\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having \"stable policy\" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid \"jeopardising investments\".\"It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and today the latest Nissan EV has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,\" he said.Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a \"damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners\".Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition \"on the assumption the UK would stay the course,\" she said.",

    "body": "Former chancellor George Osborne is joining artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI.He will lead its \"OpenAI for Countries\" programme, which is aimed at helping governments increase their AI capacity.Announcing his new London-based role, Osborne said it was a privilege to be joining the company.\"I recently asked myself the question: what's the most exciting and promising company in the world right now? The answer I believe is OpenAI,\" he said on X.The announcement follows news that government-level negotiations between the UK and the US over a tech deal that included greater co-operation in AI have faltered.OpenAI's chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane said Osborne's decision to join the company reflected \"a shared belief that AI is becoming critical infrastructure – and early decisions about how it's built, governed, and deployed will shape economics and geopolitics for years to come.\"OpenAI for Countries is designed to work with governments \"to ensure that global AI systems are built on democratic values\", Mr Lehane wrote on LinkedIn. So far the programme has engaged with more than 50 countries.He said Osborne will work with governments to help develop AI infrastructure, build AI literacy and use AI to improve public services.\"In his new role, George will help to expand existing partnerships and build new ones,\" Mr Lehane added.Osborne, who co-hosts a podcast and is also chair of the British Museum, said he joined the firm after conversations with OpenAI's chief executive Sam Altman and chief operating officer Brad Lightcap. He said the pair are \"exceptionally impressive leaders and that they care very deeply about their mission to ensure the power of artificial intelligence is developed responsibly, and the benefits are felt by all\". Osborne added: \"That's exactly what the OpenAI for Countries initiative intends to achieve, helping societies around the world share the opportunity this powerful technology brings.\"Osborne said he was leaving his current role at investment bank Evercore, which was a \"huge wrench\".He was also previously editor of the Evening Standard newspaper from 2017 to 2020.Osborne's new job was first reported by the Financial Times.The announcement comes a Downing Street insisted it remained in active conversation with the US government over a major tech deal.The deal, unveiled in September, included £31bn in planned spending from tech giants including Nvidia and Google.But reports emerged that \"broader disagreements\" between the US and UK had stalled negotiations.Osborne's appointment also comes amid a boom in AI investment - and growing jitters of a potential AI market bubble.Earlier this month the Bank of England warned of a potential \"sharp correction\" in the value of major tech companies, adding growth in the AI sector would be fuelled by trillions of dollars in debt over the next five years.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel ClunBusiness reporterGetty ImagesLabour's flagship workers' rights bill has passed its last parliamentary hurdle and is set to become law before Christmas.Conservative peer Lord Sharpe, the shadow business and trade minister, had tabled an amendment to the Employment Rights Bill during its latest stage of parliamentary ping pong in the House of Lords. But he withdrew the amendment after a short debate, removing the final block on the bill's passage.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the development marked a \"major victory for working people in every part of the country\".\"We have just introduced the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation... Today our plans passed through parliament, and will soon become law,\" he said.Most of the bill's measures will require secondary legislation before coming into force.The bill applies to England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland.It will give workers access to sick pay and paternity leave from the first day on the job and contains new protections for pregnant women and new mothers.In November, Labour backed down from its plan to give all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job. But the government will bring in enhanced protections from six months in employment, the bill's most significant measure.It is expected to gain royal assent this week.Unite union's general secretary Sharon Graham said the bill must now be implemented \"without any further dilution or delay\".\"Labour need now to stop being embarrassed by these new laws for workers. The bill had already been watered far too much, not least the failure to ban fire and rehire and zero hours contracts,\" she said.The Trades Union Congress's (TUC) general secretary Paul Nowak said it was a \"historic day and early Christmas present for working people across the country\".\"Finally, working people will enjoy more security, better pay and dignity at work thanks to this bill,\" he said, echoing Unite's calls for the legislations to be implemented \"at speed\".But the Conservatives said it was \"ironic Labour's job-destroying unemployment bill passed the very same day official figures confirmed unemployment has risen every month this government has been in office\".The party was referring to figures published on Tuesday showing UK unemployment rose to 5.1% in the three months to October, from 4.3% a year earlier.Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said: \"[The bill] will pile costs onto small businesses, freeze hiring, and ultimately leave young people and jobseekers paying the price for Labour's capitulation to their union paymasters.\"In a joint statement on Monday, ahead of the deadlock ending, business groups including the British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses said they remained concerned about some of the bill's changes. But they said to keep the six-month qualifying period for unfair dismissal the legislation as it currently was should now be passed.",

    "body": "5 minutes agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandRegan MorrisA California doctor who sold ketamine to Friends star Matthew Perry has been sentenced to eight months of home detention and three years of supervised release, making him the second person to be sentenced in the actor's death.Dr Mark Chavez is among five people - including another doctor and a dealer known as the Ketamine Queen - who have pleaded guilty to drug-related charges stemming from sitcom star's 2023 death at his Los Angeles home.The San Diego-based physician admitted to obtaining ketamine from his clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription and sold it to Dr Salvador Plasencia, who supplied the dissociative anaesthetic to Perry. Plasencia was sentenced earlier this month to 30 months in prison.The multiyear federal investigation into Perry's death examined how the Emmy-winning actor acquired ketamine through an underground drug network in Hollywood. Ketamine, a surgical anaesthetic, is used as a treatment for depression, anxiety and pain. Perry, who had battled drug addiction and depression, had been prescribed the drug as part of his treatment but soon started seeking more than what he was allotted.That ultimately led him to the drug ring that ensnared the two doctors, Perry's live-in assistant, a man named Erik Fleming and American-British dual-national Jasveen Sangha, the dealer known as the Ketamine Queen. The latter three are due to be sentenced in the coming months. A post-mortem examination of Perry found a high concentration of ketamine in his blood and determined that \"acute effects\" of the substance killed him.Prosecutors said Perry's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, worked with Chavez and Plasencia to provide the actor with more than $50,000 (£38,000) of ketamine in the weeks before his death.In his plea agreement, Chavez admitted that he obtained ketamine from both his former clinic and a wholesale distributor through a fraudulent prescription. He submitted a fraudulent prescription for 30 ketamine lozenges under a former patient's name -  without her knowledge or consent - to sell to Plasencia to give to Perry. He confessed to selling 22 vials of liquid ketamine and nine ketamine lozenges to Plasencia, according to his October 2024 plea agreement.The transaction was part of a broader scheme in which Chavez and Plasencia discussed exploiting Perry's addiction for financial gain by mocking him in their text exchanges.\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia wrote to Chavez. Chavez faced up to 10 years in federal prison. As part of his October 2024 plea deal, he surrendered his medical licence and passport.",

    "body": "Couple win £1m lottery jackpot for second time2 hours agoNathan BevanBBC Wales'You can't get more luck than that': Couple celebrate second £1m lottery winOne lucky couple has beaten extraordinary odds to win £1m on the National Lottery - for the second time.  Richard Davies, 49, and Faye Stevenson-Davies, 43, first scooped a seven-figure jackpot playing the EuroMillions Millionaire Maker in June 2018.And now they have done it again by matching five main numbers and the Bonus Ball in the Lotto draw on 26 November - the chances of which are more than 24-trillion-to-one, say experts.\"We knew the odds of it happening again were outrageous, but we're proof that if you believe anything is possible,\" said Faye, from mid Wales.National LotteryThe couple celebrating their first big win in 2018But, as Richard explained, their second win was not a case of simply picking the right numbers.\"It came to us through a series of four consecutive Lotto draws,\" he said.\"When you match two numbers in the Lotto draw, you automatically win a Lucky Dip for the next game and that's what's happened to us. \"We matched two numbers and won a free Lucky Dip from one draw which put us into the next draw and so on, until the winning draw on 26 November.\"According to experts at Allwyn, operator of the National Lottery, the odds of Richard and Faye winning both the EuroMillions Millionaire Maker and then five numbers and the bonus ball on Lotto are over 24-trillion-to-one.However, this latest windfall is unlikely to change the couple's community-minded attitude.Former hairdresser Richard uses his skills at a shelter for the homeless in Cardiff, a project which received vital National Lottery funding, while also helping out friends by working as a delivery driver.National Lottery\"We're just going to take our time and enjoy the moment,\" said Richard and FayeMeanwhile, ex-nurse Faye is a volunteer cook at Cegin Hedyn community kitchen in Carmarthen, while also providing mental health counselling services to local organisations such as Brecon & District Mind charity.\"The first time we won we gifted people cars, donated a minibus to the local rugby team and did our best to help friends and family,\" said Faye, who will even be working on Christmas Day. \"It was all new and it was amazing to be able to make a difference. \"This time around, who knows? We're just going to take our time and enjoy the moment.\"Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Drive, Andrew said going public this time was \"something we didn't do lightly\".\"Since the first one we've been involved in quite a few events with the lottery and charity,\" he said.\"There's so much good out there and at the moment there's so much doom and gloom on the news. It's just a bit of cheer really.\"Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: \"I can still remember the day I met Richard and Faye for the first time, and it's just as special to be with them as they celebrate their second £1m win. \"I saw the positive impact of that first win and know this second one will be just as meaningful.\"More top stories",

    "body": "2 hours agoIan Aikman and Kayla EpsteinGetty ImagesUS President Donald Trump has filed a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC.He has accused the corporation of defamation over an edit of his speech before the US Capitol riot in a Panorama documentary.The lawsuit, which has been filed in Florida, demands $5bn (£3.7) and accuses the BBC of \"intentionally, maliciously, and deceptively doctoring\" Trump's speech.The BBC has said it will defend the case.It previously apologised to Trump for the edit, but disagreed there was a basis for a defamation claim.What was in the BBC's Trump documentary?The Panorama documentary, called Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast on 28 October 2024, just days before the US presidential election.In his speech on 6 January 2021, Trump told a Washington DC crowd: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the same speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme, a clip showed him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Criticism of the edit emerged more than a year later when a leaked internal memo was published by the Telegraph newspaper.This led to the resignations of the BBC's director general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness. BBC chairman Samir Shah apologised for the edit, which he described as an \"error of judgement\".What does Trump's lawsuit say?Trump's lawyers sent a letter to the BBC in November, demanding that it immediately retract the documentary, issue an apology, and compensate him. The BBC was given a deadline of 14 November to respond. The letter added that if the BBC did not comply, the president might file legal action.Before that deadline, the BBC apologised to Trump and confirmed the programme was not scheduled to be re-broadcast and would not be broadcast again in that  form on any BBC platform, but rejected his demands for compensation.A month later, on 15 December, Trump's legal team filed a lawsuit in Florida.The filing alleges that the BBC:defamed Trump \"intentionally, with actual malice\" by the edit of his speech for the Panorama documentaryviolated a Florida trade practices law by engaging in \"deceptive acts\" in editing the speechThe introduction to the lawsuit says the Panorama edit was a \"brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the [2024] election's outcome to President Trump's detriment\".He is seeking $5bn (£3.7m) in damages.How did the BBC respond?After Trump filed the lawsuit, a BBC spokesperson said: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\"Previously, the broadcaster said \"we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim\".In its apology to Trump in November, the BBC said the edit resulted in \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\".BBC chairman Samir Shah separately sent a personal letter to the White House, making clear to Trump that he and the corporation were sorry.However, the corporation rejected Trump's demands for compensation and set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.Those arguments were:The BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels, and it was geographically restricted to viewers in the UK when it was on iPlayerThe documentary did not cause Trump harm as he was re-electedThe clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and the edit was not done with maliceThe clip was never meant to be considered in isolation; rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained many voices in support of TrumpAn opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the USHow could the case play out?The BBC has said it will defend the case. Before the case reaches trial, it could be dismissed by a judge. In September, a US federal judge dismissed Trump's $15bn defamation lawsuit against the New York Times because it was submitted with an \"improper and impermissible\" form, but allowed Trump to refile a shorter complaint.Legal experts have said arguments over jurisdiction could play a central role, with the case hinging on whether anyone in Florida saw the documentary. The filing says the episode may have been available to viewers in Florida using a VPN or via the BritBox streaming service.The filing also seeks to establish that the BBC has enough of a presence in Florida to warrant filing there, citing a BBC office in Coral Gables.Trump's complaint goes into greater detail about jurisdiction than most defamation suits, said David Snyder, a Florida attorney who specialises in media law.\"They're trying to cover all their bases when claiming jurisdiction,\" he said. \"Frankly, it will be really up to the courts to decide whether the BBC has a sufficient footprint in the state of Florida.\"\"I think it's going to be a close question,\" Mr Snyder said.US District Judge Roy Altman has been assigned to oversee the case.If it does go to trial, the US Constitution's First Amendment gives significant protection to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Trump would need to prove three major components - that the content published was factually false in a way that was defamatory; that he suffered harm due to the false and defamatory coverage; and that the media organisation knew it was false and acted with \"actual malice\".Proving he suffered harm could be a challenge for Trump, said Seth Stern, director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation. The $5bn (£3.7m) sum might be difficult to justify to a jury, he added.He pointed to Trump winning the 2024 election, and not suffering any apparent financial losses because of the BBC's editing as problematic for his case. Chris Ruddy, founder of conservative media outlet Newsmax, and an ally of Trump, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that it was hard to win a defamation suit in the US because \"the bar is very high\". But he said the litigation process could be damaging to the BBC's reputation and expensive, with costs possibly reaching between $50m (£37m) and $100m (£74m).It is unclear when, or if, the case could go to trial, and how much it could cost the BBC. Former BBC Radio controller Mark Damazer said it would be \"extremely damaging to the BBC's reputation not to fight the case\", arguing that the case was \"about the BBC's independence\".",

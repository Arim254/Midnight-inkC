    "body": "13 hours agoPallab GhoshScience CorrespondentBBCOn Valentine's Day, there's the temptation to believe that somewhere out there is \"The One\": a soulmate, a perfect match, the person you were meant to be with.Across history, humans have always been drawn to the idea that love isn't random. In ancient Greece, Plato imagined that we were once whole beings with four arms, four legs and two faces, so radiant that Zeus split us in two; ever since, each half has roamed the earth searching for its missing other, a myth that gives the modern soulmate its poetic pedigree and the promise that somewhere, someone will finally make us feel complete.In the Middle Ages, troubadours and Arthurian tales recast that longing as \"courtly love\", a fierce, often forbidden devotion like Lancelot's for Guinevere, in which a knight proved his worth through self-sacrifice for a beloved he might never openly declare.Getty ImagesPlato (left) imagined humans were once whole,  with four arms, four legs and two faces, before Zeus (right) split them, leaving each half searching for its otherBy the Renaissance, writers such as Shakespeare were talking of \"star-crossed lovers\", couples bound together by an overwhelming connection yet pulled apart by family, fortune or fate, as if the universe itself both wrote their love story and barred them from a happy ending.In more recent times, Hollywood and romance novels have sold us fairy tale love stories.But what does the latest science say about soulmates? Is there a particular special someone out there for us?How we fall for 'The One'Viren Swami, Professor of Social Psychology at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU), in Cambridge, has traced our contemporary European understanding of romantic love back to medieval Europe and those stories of Camelot, Lancelot, Guinevere and the chivalry of the knights of the round table that swept across the continent.\"These stories first pushed the idea that you should choose one other individual as your companion and that companion is for life,\" he says.\"Before that, in much of Europe, you could love as many people as you like, and love was fluid, and it was often not about sex.\"Over time, as people are uprooted from their agricultural communities as industrialisation tears apart people's familiar attachments, individuals become \"alienated\", he says. \"They start looking for one other individual to save them, to save them from the wretchedness of their lives.\"Getty ImagesViren Swami believes today's ideas about romantic love can be traced back to medieval European stories like Lancelot and GuinevereToday's dating apps turn that story into an algorithm, which Swami calls \"relation-shopping\". The search for a soulmate turns into the opposite of what they are looking for: \"For many people, that's a really soulless experience.\"You're shopping for a partner… going through possibly dozens of people on the dating app until you get to a point where you go… I need to stop,\" he says.The OneJason Carroll, Professor of Marriage and Family Studies at the US Brigham Young University, based in Provo, Utah, is sympathetic to the longing for \"The One\".\"We are attachment-based creatures,\" he says. \"We desire that bond.\" But in his lectures, he tells students they need to leave the idea of a soulmate, without giving up their desire for The One.It sounds like a contradiction, but for Carroll, it's the difference between destiny and graft.\"A soulmate is just simply found. It's already pre‑made. But a one and only is something two people carve out together over years of adapting, apologising, and occasionally gritting their teeth,\" he says.Soulmate trapCarroll's argument draws on decades of research, which he put together in his report, The Soulmate Trap, much of which distinguishes between what psychologists call \"destiny beliefs\" - the idea that the right relationship should feel effortless - and \"growth beliefs\", which focus on what partners can do to make things work.In a widely cited series of studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s led by Professor C. Raymond Knee at the University of Houston, researchers found that people who believed relationships were \"meant to be\" were far more likely to doubt their commitment after conflict. Those with more growth-minded views tended to stay more committed, even on days when they argued.Those with growth-based views, Carroll argues, still want something special, but expect rough patches. \"They ask… what can they do to make their relationship better, have improvement and have growth?\"Getty ImagesResearch suggests people with \"growth\" beliefs about relationships still want something special, but expect challenges along the wayIn his view, the soulmate belief is a trap - not the romance itself, but the expectation that love should never be hard. The most \"soulful\" part of a long relationship, he says, is not a cinematic charge, but having \"front-row seats not only for each other's strengths, but... [their] challenges and weaknesses\".\"That's a pretty sacred space,\" he says. \"We only know those things because they've let us be there.\"For Carroll, when love is treated as fate, people become less willing to do the unshowy work that actually keeps love alive. Carroll says the soulmate trap makes it much harder when a relationship hits its first serious snag.\"The first time there's any type of struggle, the immediate thought is, 'well, I thought you were my soulmate. But maybe you're not, because soulmates aren't supposed to deal with things',\" he says. \"But if relationships are going to go long term, it's never just going to be a downhill run.\"Spark or trauma?Vicki Pavitt, a London-based love coach, often helps people who thought they'd found their soulmate, only to discover that the fairy tale came with emotional manipulation, flakiness, and a constant sense of anxiety.\"When there is a lot of chemistry and the spark, I think that can sometimes be about opening old unhealthy patterns, like old wounds\", she says.\"A person who is inconsistent or plays a bit hot and cold can make you feel 'I can't wait to see them again', but what's really happening is they're giving you so much anxiety and that it has you wanting more\".Vicki PavittLove coach Vicki Pavitt often works with people who thought they'd found a soulmate, only to find the relationship brought anxietyPavitt says what we feel to be destiny may be a pull from our nervous system recognising something that hurt us before and trying to fix it, a pattern therapists call a trauma bond.This bond can seem like love, she says, and leads to people magnetically drawn into unhealthy dynamics because they are familiar, not because they are the perfect match.One study often cited is by Canadian psychologists Donald Dutton and Susan Painter. In research published in 1993 while they were at the University of British Columbia, they followed 75 women after they had left abusive partners.The team measured how strongly the women still felt attached to their exes and compared this with what their relationships had been like.They found the strongest bonds were not in women who had consistently been abused, but in those whose partners alternated between charm and cruelty.Getty ImagesPavitt says what feels like destiny can sometimes be a trauma bondDutton and Painter argue that this trauma bond helps explain why people can feel magnetised back to relationships that are objectively bad for them – because the mix of danger and affection is familiar, not because it is healthy.It is that distinction Pavitt tries to surface in coaching: \"It's about discerning whether the chemistry you feel is showing me this person's compatible with me or if it is a familiar sense of anxiety.\"In my language, I never talk about soulmates,\" she says. \"I don't personally believe that there is one person for everybody... but I do believe that we become \"The One\" for someone.\"Real chemistryIf ruling out the existence of a soulmate sounds unromantic, the biology of attraction points in the same direction.Hormonal contraceptives may subtly reshape how partners feel about each other. Research suggests that pills which flatten the natural ebb and flow of fertility can dampen shifts in attraction that typically occur across the menstrual cycle, potentially altering initial mate choice.PA WireSome research suggests hormonal contraception may subtly influence attraction in partnersOne large study of 365 hetrosexual couples found that women's sexual satisfaction was higher when their current contraceptive status matched what it was when they first chose their partner, hinting that changes in pill use can change how a partner is experienced. These effects are small but could help explain some couples' puzzling shifts in chemistry over time.If hormones and pills can tilt who feels like \"The One\", then it becomes harder to argue there is a single, pre‑ordained match – which is where the mathematicians come in.The one but not the onlyPsychology and biology offer one way of thinking about \"The One\", but mathematics puts forward another.Dr Greg Leo, an economist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, has come up with a compatibility algorithm. It finds that not only might you have a \"One\" you have lots of \"Ones\".In his Matching Soulmates paper in the journal of Public Economic Theory, everyone is in a computer simulated dating pool, where thousands of digitally created daters rank each other. His algorithm picks \"first‑order soulmates\": pairs who choose each other in a stable matching. It removes them, and runs it again with those left, and you get second‑order soulmates, and so on.More from InDepthIn his simulations, it was extremely rare for someone to have their mutual first picks; but many people had those that were second or third picks. In this scenario a couple counts as happy if each is near the top of the other's list and neither can find someone they and that other person would both prefer more.It may only be number crunching, but the love algorithm tells us that there are many viable partners, not just The One.Sweat the small stuffSo how can a couple co-create their Ones?Jacqui Gabb, Professor of Sociology and Intimacy at The Open University, assessed this in her Enduring Love project, published in the journal Sociology in 2015.It surveyed around 5,000 people and then followed 50 couples in forensic, sometimes intrusive detail, combining statistics with diaries, interviews and \"emotion maps\" of what happened in the home.When she asked people what made them feel appreciated, it wasn't sunset proposals or surprise trips to Paris.It was \"surprise gifts, thoughtful gestures and the kindness of a cup of tea in bed\". Warming the car on a cold morning. Picking wildflowers and putting them in a vase. Sharing a private smile at a party.Quantitatively, what she describes as these \"everyday attentive acts\" turned out to be much more powerful than grand romantic gestures.In her survey, 22% of mothers and 20% of childless women picked such small gestures as one of the top two things that made them feel valued – more than big nights out or expensive presents.Relationship satisfaction in the data wasn't primarily about money or romance; it was about \"intimate couple knowledge\" and its expression in daily life.In one young couple's diary given to them for the project, Sumaira describes her partner coming home, the dinner she has cooked, the hug in the hallway, the two of them eating together at the table.\"It's perfect,\" she writes in her research diary. \"Just us and food. What more could I want?\"Then there is a spontaneous dance in the living room, a walk in long grass where she gets scared of the dark, and a photo her partner loves so much he makes it the background on his phone.It reads like a lovely every day tale, not a fairy tale: no glass slippers, but wellies.Yet Gabb points out that woven through the sweetness are money worries, family obligations and a history of depression that the couple are learning to manage together.\"The soulmate feeling here doesn't float above life; it is made, inch by inch, by life, in the way the pair meet those pressures,\" she says.Valentine's DinnerThe science doesn't steal the romance – rather it's there to help it bloom, in good times and bad, according to Carroll.\"I'm pretty comfortable with the aspiration to be in a unique special relationship as long as we remember it needs to be created,\" he says.Pavitt thinks \"it's fine, helpful, even to have faith that your person is out there, so long as you know there are many people that you could form a really great connection with and stop expecting anyone to be perfect\".As for soulmates, the science points to a paradox. The people who end up with relationships that feel uniquely \"meant to be\" are often the ones who stopped waiting for fate, turned towards the flawed person in front of them and said, in effect: shall we make something of this?Additional reporting by Florence FreemanTop image credit: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "GB's Weston bids for skeleton gold - Friday's guideImage caption, Updated 12 February 2026The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina.Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential.Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for.All times GMT.Day seven: Friday, 13 FebruaryMedals: SevenMedal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05)Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno.Figure skating: Men – free skate (18:00-22:10)We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps.Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20)Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston in prime position to win gold.The two-time world champion - and Team GB's biggest medal hope in Milan-Cortina - holds an advantage of 0.30 seconds over his nearest rival.The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB.Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 – is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold?Good to knowWomen's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent.Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05.Day eight: Saturday, 14 February Medals: EightMedal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage – back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian – Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 – so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar?Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson.Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50)It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a yearFreestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45)Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury.Good to knowThe two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT).Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05.Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm.Day nine: Sunday, 15 FebruaryMedals: NineMedal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)     After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run.Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00)Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima.Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00)This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today.Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00)The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today.Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45)A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships.Good to knowThe first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut.The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round.It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling – they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals.Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014.Day 10: Monday, 16 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 monthsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35)Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor.Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00)The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold – and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh.Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50)Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 – the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title.Good to knowWomen's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries.It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling – Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05.The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain.Day 11: Tuesday, 17 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05).Daily highlightsSnowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35)British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting.Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00)Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold.Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50)New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025.Good to knowWomen's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing.Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Day 12: Wednesday, 18 FebruaryMedals: EightMedal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00).Daily highlightsAlpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30)\"I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,\" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. \"For the past few years, it has been a little bit.\" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014\"It's not so much about unfinished business,\" continued the American. \"It's more about making peace.\" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title.Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars.Good to knowIt's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage.In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches.There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title?Day 13: Thursday, 19 February Medals: SevenMedal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215).Daily highlightsSki mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15)Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics – ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30.Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10)The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle – reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian – who will be competing as a neutral athlete – emerge as a contender?Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25)Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign.Good to knowIt's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and – in the case of the men's competition – played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05).Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion.The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m.Day 14: Friday, 20 FebruaryMedals: SixMedal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned – she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing.Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10)The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980.Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled – and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022.Good to knowIt's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05).Day 15: Saturday, 21 FebruaryMedals: 10Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135).Daily highlightsFreestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35)Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years.Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03)Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20)Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT.Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05)Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title.Good to knowAs well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany – particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich – have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations.The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics.Day 16: Sunday, 22 FebruaryMedals: FourMedal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40)Daily highlightsBobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12)History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in BeijingCurling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20)This event proved the highlight – and saving grace – of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely.Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10)Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner – so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions.Good to knowWith all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held.Related topicsShort Track SkatingCurlingLugeSpeed SkatingWinter SportsNordic CombinedIce HockeyAlpine SkiingCross-Country SkiingBobsleighBiathlonSkeletonSnowboardingWinter OlympicsSki JumpingFreestyle SkiingFigure Skating",

The Washington Post’s owner - Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - has announced mass layoffs at the newspaper, which will fundamentally change how it covers the news.  \nWhen Bezos bought the paper in 2013, he reassured staff about a “new golden era for the Washington Post”, and later adopted a new slogan for the Washington Post “Democracy Dies in Darkness”.  \nJustin and Anthony discuss why the cuts have happened and what the wider impact may be on US media.  With Bezos defending the cuts as “the data tells us what is valuable and where to focus\",  we look at whether the role of money, influence, and closeness to President Trump could also be at play? \nHOSTS: \n• Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n• Anthony Zurcher, North America Correspondent\nGET IN TOUCH: \n• Join our online community: https://discord.gg/qSrxqNcmRB \n• Send us a message or voice note via WhatsApp to +44 330 123 9480\n• Email Americast@bbc.co.uk\n• Or use #Americast \nThis episode was made by Rufus Gray, Grace Reeve and Kris Jalowiecki.

    "body": "Taylor Swift asks US government to block 'Swift Home' trademark10 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesPop star Taylor Swift has asked the US government to stop a bedding company's attempt to trademark the phrase \"Swift Home\", saying it could mislead consumers into believing she had endorsed their products.Her legal team argued that the way Cathay Home has styled the word \"Swift\" in its branding closely resembled the singer's trademarked cursive signature.Cathay Home, which was founded in New York, says on its site that it sells products through major retailers, and had applied for the \"Swift Home\" trademark for its bedding items.The BBC has contacted Cathay Home and the teams representing Swift for comment.Swift, represented by TAS Rights Management LLC, appealed against Cathay Home's application in a document, seen by the BBC, which was issued to the US Patent and Trademark Office on Wednesday.The \"Swift Home\" mark creates a \"false association\" to the singer that may lead Cathay Home's customers to believe the pop star had endorsed its products in some way, the filing said.Veneble LLPTaylor Swift's trademarked logo (left), next to Cathay Home's \"Swift Home\" designThis was done with the intent of using Swift's \"goodwill and recognition\" for the company's brand, her legal team said.The documents said that Swift owns federal trademarks that protected the use of her name and signature on goods, including bedding, clothes and products related to her music.Swift has filed more than 300 trademarks in the US and other jurisdictions, securing her name, initials, album titles and some lyrics.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoGetty ImagesPeter Murrell is due to appear in court next Friday for a preliminary hearingThe former SNP chief executive Peter Murrell is facing a charge of embezzling £459,000 from the party over a period of more than 12 years, it has emerged.Details of the case against Murrell, the estranged husband of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, are contained in a copy of an indictment seen by BBC News.According to the document, Murrell is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023.He is accused of illicitly purchasing items including luxury goods, jewellery, cosmetics, two cars and a motorhome.Murrell is due to appear at the High Court in Glasgow on Friday 20 February for a preliminary hearing in the case.He made no plea during an initial appearance at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last year after which he was granted bail.PA MediaMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of a probe into the SNP's financesMurrell was arrested in 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, a police investigation into the funding and finance of the SNP. He was charged with embezzlement in April 2024.Sturgeon was also questioned by detectives, but police have since confirmed she is no longer under investigation.BBC News has seen a copy of an indictment against Murrell ahead of the preliminary hearing next week.These papers are subject to change up until the point the accused appears in court, and can be altered throughout the judicial process.The indictment includes allegations that Murrell used party funds to buy a £124,550 motorhome \"for your own personal use\" from a dealer in Staffordshire, and that he created false documentation \"to portray the purchase as a legitimate party expense\".Murrell is further accused of using £57,500 of SNP money towards the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-PACE car in 2019.It is also alleged that he falsified an invoice \"in an attempt to disguise the true nature\" of that purchase, and that when the Jaguar was sold in 2021, more than £47,000 was paid into his personal bank account.Murrell is also alleged to have embezzled £16,489 from the SNP in part payment for a £33,000 Volkswagen Golf purchased in Newbridge, Edinburgh, in 2016.The indictment includes a list of more than 80 retailers where Murrell was alleged to have made purchases totalling more than £159,000 between December 2014 and 2022, \"for your own personal use or the personal use of others\".These range from Harrods, the Royal Mint and John Lewis to Homebase and Argos.It claims these purchases were made using credit or charge cards belonging to the SNP, and that \"false or inaccurate accounting codes and descriptions\" for the purchases had been inserted into accounting systems.The indictment also alleges Murrell made purchases with a value of over £81,600 through online retailer Amazon in the same manner.Murrell held the position of SNP chief executive for 22 years.He married Sturgeon in 2010, but the former party leader and first minister announced their separation in January 2025.",

    "body": "3 hours agoMichael Sheils McNameeFBIThe FBI has now confirmed that the masked man seen in the video is a suspect in the case The FBI has released the first physical description of the man believed to have kidnapped Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US news anchor Savannah Guthrie. Nancy Guthrie, 84, disappeared in the middle of night from her Tucson, Arizona, home and was last seen two weeks ago. The authorities believe she was taken against her will.The FBI has analysed footage from a doorbell camera outside her home and believes she was kidnapped by a male who is between 5ft 9in (175cm) and 5ft 10in tall, with an average build. It is first time the man in the video has been officially identified as a suspect in the case, which has drawn a huge amount of attention both in the US and abroad.In its latest statement, the FBI said it had been able to establish identifying details after carrying out a forensic analysis. It highlighted the backpack being worn by the suspect in the video, which was released earlier this week, and identified it is a 25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.A pair of black gloves has also been found during the search for Guthrie, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS reported on Thursday.FBINancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of Saturday 31 January when family members dropped her home. Members of her church noticed her absence at Sunday's service and notified her family.Officials have warned she may be in dire health without her medication. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said she was \"not in good physical health\" but had no reported cognitive issues.Since 1 February, the FBI said it had received more than 13,000 tips in relation to the case - including 4,000 in the 24 hours after the doorbell camera footage was released. It is offering money to anyone who comes forward with information about her disappearance and has now doubled the reward from $50,000 (£36,700) to $100,000. Getty ImagesThe reward for information related to the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie has increased to $100,000Earlier this week, a man was detained in connection with Guthrie's disappearance and his home in Rio Rico - south of Tucson, Arizona - was searched before he was released. Speaking to reporters following the incident and said he did not know who Nancy Guthrie was. Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a number of social media pleas directed at their mother's potential abductors. They believe she is still alive and have indicated they would be willing to pay for her return. ",

    "body": "Can a pulse of electricity to the brain make us less selfish?13 hours agoVictoria GillScience correspondent GettyScientists have discovered how to make people less selfish - at least temporarily - by stimulating two areas of their brain.In a new study carried out at the University of Zurich, 44 volunteers were asked to decide how to split an amount of money between themselves and an anonymous partner. During the experiment, an electrical current was applied to the frontal and parietal areas of the brain - situated at the front and towards the back. When these areas were stimulated at the same time, the participants gave away more money. \"The effects were not huge, but they're consistent,\" said Prof Christian Ruff, one of the lead authors who carried out the experiments. Changing behaviour \"Statistically, we really see an increase in their willingness to pay.\"As well as revealing something about the mechanisms behind fundamental human behaviour, the findings, researchers say, could be useful in treating some brain disorders.\"There are people who have profound problems with social behaviour, because they can't take other people's perspective into account and are constantly behaving selfishly,\" Prof Ruff told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science. \"That's when we could use this.\"In the case of this experiment, the effects were short-lived. \"To really change behaviour in the longer term, you would have to do it repeatedly,\" said Prof Ruff. He compared the potential effects to going to the gym. One workout will not improve your fitness, \"but if you go to the gym twice weekly for a period of two months, your body changes. This is the same.\"Nicolas ZonviThis new discovery builds on their previous study, which monitored brain activity while participants played the same money-sharing game.In that study, the researchers pinpointed the two brain areas that appeared to be \"talking to each other\" - with brain cells firing at the same frequency - when players gave away more money.Those two brain areas are known to play a role in decision-making and in empathy, or distinguishing the feelings of others from our own. When a more selfless decision was made, the empathy region and the decision region appeared to communicate.So for this study, the researchers wanted to find out if they could use electrical stimulation to \"nudge\" people towards more selfless decisions.One anonymous volunteer, who tried out the brain stimulation test, said the experience felt \"like a warm shower or small drops of rain\" on the scalp.\"Immediately after starting the stimulation, I was making the decisions displayed on a screen. At no time did I have the sensation that the stimulation was impacting my decisions.\"Identifying this selfless decision brain activity, in multiple people, strongly suggests that altruism is hardwired in our brains; that it evolved to make us take care of others.Being able to influence and change that mechanism, Prof Ruff explained, \"is what makes this discovery clinically relevant\".Prof Ruff's co-author, Dr Jie Hu from East China Normal University, said: \"What's new here is evidence of cause and effect.\"When we altered communication in a specific brain network using targeted, non-invasive stimulation, people's sharing decisions changed - shifting how they balanced their own interests against others.\"But should we be concerned - or unsettled - by an experiment that influences behaviour in this way? Prof Ruff says \"absolutely not\".\"This is medically regulated specifically for these experiments,\" he explained. \"It goes through an ethics committee and people give informed consent, which they can withdraw at any time.The neuroscientist compared that to the influences on our behaviour from social media and advertising. \"There you have no control over what you're exposed to [and how your brain responds to it],\" he said.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoSimon Fraser,Asia digital editor, LondonandYogita Limaye,South Asia and Afghanistan correspondent, DhakaReutersTarique Rahman has been out of the country for 17 years. He has promised democracy will be restoredThe centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has secured a landslide majority in parliament, 18 months after mass protests ousted the country's longest serving prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The party took more than two-thirds of seats in the historic general election, with Jamaat, the country's main Islamist party, coming second. Hasina's Awami League was banned from taking part.BNP leader Tarique Rahman is set to be the next prime minister and faces huge challenges in getting the economy back on its feet and restoring democracy after 15 years of authoritarian rule under Hasina.Voters also backed sweeping democratic reforms in a referendum held alongside the election.\"I am grateful for the love you have shown me,\" Tarique Raman told well-wishers in Dhaka as he attended Friday prayers. His party has said there would be no victory procession.He was elected to parliament for the first time as one of 212 successful BNP  candidates. The Election Commission put voter turnout at 59.44%.It is a huge change of fortunes for a man who spent 17 years in self-imposed exile in London. He took over as head of his party after his mother, former PM Khaleda Zia, died in December.During his campaign, Tarique Rahman promised that democracy would be restored. Reviving the country's economy, bringing rising food prices under control and creating jobs for Bangladesh's huge young population are the big challenges facing the new government.Repairing strained ties with giant neighbour India is also high up the list of priorities.Within hours of his win, Rahman had received a call from India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi who congratulated him on a \"remarkable victory\".\"As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India's continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,\" Modi wrote on X.Although the BNP are promising to lead change in the country, the party was criticised for corruption and accused of human rights violations when it was last in government in the early 2000's.Thursday's democratic exercise is a moment of huge potential - and risk - for the country, with one of its two main parties winning such a big victory. Among the constitutional reforms envisaged are prime ministerial term limits, a directly elected upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and increased judicial independence. Greater representation of women in parliament is also in the charter - and judging by the tiny number of successful female candidates in the election, there is a long way to go.  Tarique Rahman will be under great scrutiny to deliver to a very youthful electorate hungry for change, many of whom took part in the student-led protests that resulted in Hasina's downfall, paving the way for the 12 February election.",

    "body": "Welsh rugby in turmoil as tens of thousands of Six Nations tickets still not sold2 hours agoLola MayorBBC Wales Getty ImagesAre Welsh rugby fans starting to turn their back on the national side?Tens of thousands of tickets for Wales' three home fixtures in this year's Six Nations  have still not been sold.The matches at Cardiff's 74,000-seat Principality Stadium usually sell out or reach high capacity for a tournament that has traditionally been a highlight of the Welsh sporting calendar.On Friday morning there were 15,300 unsold for Sunday's clash with France; 6,700 left for Scotland and 27,000 for Italy's visit in March, according to the WRU's official ticket site.The WRU said buying habits have changed and tickets for the France game have been selling at a rate of 1,000 a day this week .Numbers of empty seats could potentially be higher on Sunday with clubs that are entitled to an allocation of tickets, including Swansea, Llandaff North and Machen, trying to shift tickets on social media over the past week. With tickets costing between £40 and £120, one club chairman said \"it's not worth it\".Sports economist Prof Calvin Jones said: \"Obviously the Six Nations is the jewel in the crown of rugby in certain Welsh terms, and for France, the favourites probably for the tournament, it's a really big match.\"I can't remember in my 30 years as a sports economist this [so many unsold tickets] happening before.\"Welsh rugby is in turmoil on and off the pitch. Getty ImagesTickets for Wales' home fixtures have historically always sold wellJones said a Six Nations with low ticket sales would not be a disaster if it was a one-off. But he added: \"The stadium is absolutely mission critical to Welsh rugby, that's where the money now comes from given the declining rates for regional rugby that we've seen in the last 20 or 30 years.\"The WRU has done a very good job of diversifying again in terms of more concerts, cultural events and so on, but the stadium needs to work for Welsh rugby to work.\"So if this was to become a longer term problem, then you'd be really worried about financial viability of the whole game.\"He said there was a need to \"rebuild trust between the various bits of rugby and Wales\".Getty ImagesSports economist Calvin Jones says he has never seen such a lack of demand for ticketsPenarth RFC's chairman Sean O'Sullivan said the cost of tickets was \"not worth it\" for some fans, adding: \"As a family we are going skiing in Poland for two days and it's not costing us much more than going to Cardiff, with meals and drinks. \"This trip is costing us about 20 to 30% more than we have spent before [on rugby days in Cardiff].\"Watching other teams play is like watching a different sport.\"The excitement will be if a team like Italy does well not Wales.\"O'Sullivan has seen a \"steady demise\" in demand for tickets bought through his club. Eight years ago, Penarth RFC would have taken every ticket available to them, but because of the cost rising, they have in the past struggled to sell them all.He said they are not the only ones: \"You have some clubs who have had to flog their tickets outside the stadium on the day.\"He believes cost and the quality of performance have combined, adding: \"If you're taking 10-year-old kids to the game you are going for the atmosphere not necessarily for the game. \"It's an expensive day out. You can go to Paris for the same money.\"The financial loss from empty seats is hard to quantify, as prices vary per game and there are concessions, such as student discounts.Getty ImagesWith the game in turmoil on and off the pitch, ticket sales are strugglingWhat is Wales' lowest Six Nations crowd?The lowest crowd for a Wales home Six Nations game against France came in 2022 when 63,208 attended a Friday night game.Overall, the smallest attendance in the tournament at the Principality Stadium was 58,349 against Italy in 2002.Two years ago, the same Wales v France fixture was held on a Sunday and attracted a crowd of 71,242.Gwenda Harding says people in Wales need to support the team In Gwynedd, there was sadness but not surprise at the situation. \"They're not doing very well. it's a shame really and its hard to watch,\" said Gwenda Harding, from Llanberis.\"You try and support them through thick and thin. If you're a true supporter it's hard to take because they're losing all the time and not playing very well.\"A one-off [is acceptable] but they haven't altered for the last year really.\"Gareth Jones, from Caernarfon, added: \"When you see the performances they have done over the last two years it's not been too good. I wouldn't pay £85 for a ticket, it's not for me.\"[Football] has grown and grown and grown. Tickets have sold out in abundance. You could fill the Principality Stadium twice over.\"WRU chief operating officer Gavin Marshall said: \"Ticket-buying habits are undoubtedly changing and sales have sped up since the start of the Guinness Six Nations, with run rates reaching over 1,000 a day this week for the France game.\"We have some of the most loyal fans in the world in Wales and we know they will be in good voice on Sunday, for the acapella anthem and beyond, to help make home advantage count in what will obviously be a huge contest for us.\"We always work hard to fill Principality Stadium to its rafters and we are confident the expected attendance will make for another incredible match day experience for all involved.\"Additonal reporting by Matthew Richards and Gareth Wyn Williams.More top stories",

    "body": "15 hours agoEmma Pengelly,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianVantorIran has been fortifying an underground complex near one of its nuclear facilities, according to analysis of new satellite images.This activity comes at a time of heightened tensions as talks between Iranian and US officials continue, with President Donald Trump threatening fresh military action against Iran if it does not agree a new deal on its nuclear programme.The photos, first analysed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based think tank, show tunnel entrances being strengthened at Mount Kolang Gaz La - also known as Pickaxe Mountain.Experts say this facility may be designed to protect Iran's uranium enrichment activities or key equipment, but its exact purpose - and whether it is operational - remains unclear.Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.However, Trump said Iran was as little as a month away from having a nuclear weapon in June 2025, when he ordered strikes on three underground nuclear sites where centrifuges were being used to produce highly enriched uranium during a 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year.Trump said the strikes had \"obliterated\" Iran's enrichment capacity, but that Iranian officials \"were thinking about starting a new site\".Pickaxe Mountain was not one of the locations attacked in US and Israeli air strikes in June 2025, but the Natanz nuclear facility, located about 2km (1.24 miles) north, was hit.A satellite image from 10 February shows what appears to be fresh concrete laid on top of one of the Pickaxe Mountain entrance areas.A boom pump used to deliver concrete can be seen at the location, analysts from both ISIS and UK-based intelligence analysis firm Maiar agreed.At another tunnel entrance, rock and soil has been pushed back and flattened. There's also a new concrete-reinforced structure nearby.Experts at ISIS suggest these changes are intended to strengthen the tunnel entrances and give additional protection against a potential air strike.ISIS says the ongoing presence of heavy construction machinery and material indicates the facility is not likely to be ready for operations yet.\"In the past, Iran has tied the construction to rebuilding an advanced centrifuge assembly plant, but the size of the facility, as well as the protection provided by the tall mountain, raised immediate concern whether additional sensitive activities are planned, such as uranium enrichment,\" they said.Satellite images also show repair work and defensive strengthening has been taking place at the nearby Natanz nuclear site and at the Isfahan nuclear complex, 125km (77 miles) to the north, in recent weeks.At Isfahan, all entrances to its tunnel complex now appear to be sealed off with earth, satellite images reviewed by ISIS reveal..Backfilling the tunnel entrances like this would \"help dampen\" any air strike, ISIS says, as well as help to defend against a land-based assault to seize or destroy any highly enriched uranium that may be housed inside..ISIS has assessed the roof was added to block the view of anyone trying to observe what Iran was doing beneath it.Prof Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University in the US, says Iran is \"operating under the assumption that the attacks are going to happen and they need to protect the facilities as much as they can\".\"[The] Iranian nuclear programme hasn't been destroyed,\" he added. \"Clearly once you have the knowledge and capacity and technology to reconstruct the programme, you can always rebuild everything.\"Rafael Grossi, the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC a new nuclear deal between Iran and the US was possible and was urgently needed.\"My sense, talking to all those involved, is that we have a window of opportunity, but windows of opportunity have a tendency to shut themselves quite abruptly and brusquely, so I think the we need to seize the moment,\" he said in an interview at the Munich Security Conference.He also said he believed Iran's estimated 400kg of highly enriched uranium - which is a short, technical step away from weapons grade - remained in the underground tunnels and chambers where the US dropped bunker-busting bombs last June.Graphics by Tom ShielMore on this story",

    "body": "3 hours agoMatt McGrathEnvironment correspondentTrump announces rollback of Obama-era greenhouse gas rulingUS President Donald Trump has reversed a key Obama-era scientific ruling that underpins all federal actions on curbing planet-warming gases.The so-called 2009 \"endangerment finding\" concluded that a range of greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. It's become the legal bedrock of federal efforts to rein in emissions, especially in vehicles.The White House called the reversal the \"largest deregulation in American history\", saying it would make cars cheaper, bringing down costs for automakers by $2,400 per vehicle.Environmental groups say the move is by far the most significant rollback on climate change yet attempted and are set to challenge it in the courts.Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said the 2009 ruling  was \"a disastrous Obama era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers\".\"This radical rule became the legal foundation for the Green New Scam, one of the greatest scams in history,\" added the Republican president, about the Democrats' climate agenda.Former President Barack Obama, who infrequently comments on the policies of sitting presidents, said that repealing the finding would make Americans more vulnerable.\"Without it, we'll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money,\" he wrote on X. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first took a stance on the impacts of greenhouse gases in 2009, in the first year of Obama's first term.The agency decided that six key planet-warming greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, were a danger to human health.With a divided Congress unable to agree on legislation to tackle rising global temperatures, the EPA finding became central to federal efforts to rein in emissions in the years that followed.\"The endangerment finding has really served as the lynchpin of US regulation of greenhouse gases,\" said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Department of Justice attorney.\"So that includes motor vehicles, but it also includes power plants, the oil and gas sector, methane from landfills, even aircraft. So it really runs the gamut, all of the standards for each of the sectors is premised on this one thing.\"Trump administration officials are stressing that overturning the regulation will save more than $1tn and will help cut the price of energy and transport.Reversing the finding will reduce automobile manufacturers' costs by $2,400 per vehicle, the White House claimed.These regulations have been an economic strain, said Diana Furchtgott-Roth, who served in the US Department of Transportation during the first Trump term.\"The burden on the economy results in higher prices and manufacturing has left. It's gone to China, where it's made in a dirtier way,\" she told the BBC. \"So to say that we're reducing global emissions by ending energy intensive manufacturing in some countries, then having it go to China and India, where it's made in a dirtier way, does not reduce global emissions.\"Many environmentalists are sceptical of the potential cost savings being touted by the Trump team. \"It's going to force Americans to spend more money, around $1.4tn in additional fuel costs to power these less efficient and higher polluting vehicles,\" said Peter Zalzal from the Environmental Defense Fund.\"We've also analysed the health impacts and found that the action would result in up to 58,000 additional premature deaths, 37 million more asthma attacks,\" he said.For some in the US car industry there will be uncertainty about the rollback as manufacturing less fuel-efficient vehicles might limit their sales overseas.\"This rollback is sort of cementing things that have already been done, such as the relaxation of the fuel economy standards,\" said Michael Gerrard, a climate law expert from Columbia University.\"But it really does put the US automakers in a bind, because nobody else is going to want to buy American cars.\"While the reversal will help the White House to roll back climate change regulations, there are likely to be unintended consequences, according to some observers.While working on overturning the finding, the Trump administration also utilised the 2009 ruling to prevent states from passing laws that would be stricter on carbon emissions.The fact that the finding gave responsibility for regulating warming gases to a federal authority was also used to suppress what are termed \"nuisance\" lawsuits, brought by individuals or organisations on the climate question.\"The endangerment finding decision has blocked any number of lawsuits, and has been pretty powerful in keeping plaintiffs' claims out of court ,\" said Meghan Greenfield, now with Washington law firm of Jenner & Block.\"I would expect states and non-profit groups to bring suits, probably primarily in our state courts, to try to figure out where the contours of this new law are.\"John Kerry to BBC: Trump's climate change policy will 'cost lives'Challenging climate science One key argument about the reversal of the endangerment finding will be about the science on which it is based. The Department of Energy formed a panel of scientists to write a report last year challenging widely accepted science on the warming impact of greenhouse gases.That report underpinned the initial proposal to reverse the 2009 finding.But many climate experts complained that the panel behind the report was unrepresentative and filled with people who were sceptical of the human influence on warming, and that it was inaccurate and misleading.While it's not clear how much the Trump administration will rely on this report to face off any challenges, a federal judge recently ruled that the department had violated the law in the formation of the hand-picked team that wrote it.In fact, a challenge in court on the reversal of the endangerment finding may well be what the Trump administration is now looking for.Many legal experts believe that they want the proposal to be tested in the Supreme Court before Trump's term ends, believing that if they win, the endangerment finding will be consigned to history.\"This is really different as the EPA is exiting the space entirely and wants to do it on a permanent basis,\" said Meghan Greenfield.\"If they were to win that issue as they framed it before the Supreme Court, a new presidential administration could not change that position, in the absence of new legislation.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoAnna LamcheReutersThe US Secretary of State is due to address the Munich Security Conference on SaturdayUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken of a defining moment and a \"new era\" as he travels to Europe for a major speech to the Munich Security Conference.Rubio will lead the US delegation at the first major global event since President Donald Trump threatened Danish sovereignty with a pledge to annex Greenland.French President Emmanuel Macron has insisted Europe must prepare for independence from the US, while Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte has stressed that transatlantic bonds are as close and important as ever.The war in Ukraine, tensions with China and a potential nuclear deal between Iran and the US are also on the agenda as the security conference gets under way.\"The world is changing very fast right in front of us,\" Rubio told reporters, when asked if his message to Europeans would be more conciliatory than a year ago.\"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.\"At last year's conference, US Vice-President JD Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.Some 50 world leaders are set to attend this year's event, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed at a time when  US commitments to Nato have been called into question.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters on Friday she planned to meet with Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Denmark's semi-autonomous territory from its Nato ally.The US threats have been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with its biggest ally.Ahead of the conference, eight former US ambassadors to Nato and eight former American supreme commanders in Europe issued an open letter calling for Washington to maintain its support for the Western defensive alliance.\"Far from being a charity\", they said Nato was a \"force-multiplier\" that allowed the US to assert its power and influence \"in ways that would be impossible - or prohibitively expensive - to achieve on its own\".The transatlantic relationship has come under increasing strain following the Republican president's introduction of tariffs and a suggestion in the US national security strategy that European nations may not remain \"reliable allies\" in the long term.Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel told the BBC on Friday that he recognised \"the world has changed\" and that he hoped the \"transatlantic bond\" remains \"solid\". Van Weel said he recognised that the Netherlands needed to \"step up\" when it came to its own security but that his country was making a \"big sacrifice\" to increase its defence spending.\"It will take time before we can really take over [the security] burden from the Americans in Europe,\" he warned. Watch key moments from Vance's 2025 speech in MunichRubio is expected to avoid taking Vance's abrasive approach from last year but, when asked if he was planning to be more conciliatory, he told reporters that Europeans \"want to know where we're going, where we'd like to go, where we'd like to go with them\".Hours before German Chancellor Friedrich Merz was due to open the Munich conference, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told German public TV that the aim was to define jointly what held Nato together and show the US that it needed Europe too.Macron will also address the conference on Friday, having told the World Economic Forum in Davos last month that now was \"not a time for new imperialism or new colonialism\".After a week of turbulent domestic politics, Sir Keir Starmer will also travel to Munich, where he is expected to hold meetings with both Merz and Macron, before addressing the summit on Saturday morning.Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, in a report ahead of the event, said: \"For generations, US allies were not just able to rely on American power but on a broadly shared understanding of the principles underpinning the international order.\"Today, this appears far less certain, raising difficult questions about the future shape of transatlantic and international co-operation.\"The former German diplomat said the White House's foreign policy \"is already changing the world, and it has triggered dynamics whose full consequences are only beginning to emerge\".Upon arrival in Munich, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the conference would bring \"new steps toward our shared security - that of Ukraine and Europe\".On Friday, Russian media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying another round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the US aimed at ending the war would take place in Geneva on 17 and 18 February.Kyiv and Washington have not yet commented.The three countries recently held talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with no apparent breakthrough - although Ukraine and Russia carried out a rare exchange of prisoners of war shortly after the US-brokered discussions ended.

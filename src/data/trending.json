    "body": "Rift at top of the Taliban: BBC reveals clash of wills behind internet shutdown6 hours agoBBC AfghanAFP via Getty ImagesIt was a piece of audio obtained by the BBC that revealed what worries the Taliban's leader most.Not an external danger, but one from within Afghanistan, which the Taliban seized control of as the previous government collapsed and the US withdrew in 2021.He warned of \"insiders in the government\" pitted against each other in the Islamic Emirate the Taliban set up to govern the country.In the leaked clip, the supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada can be heard giving a speech saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.\"As a result of these divisions, the emirate will collapse and end,\" he warned.Javid Ashna / Middle East Images / AFP via Getty ImagesSupreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada (centre) has \"absolute power\", his spokesman said - but ministers including Sirajuddin Haqqani (left) and Mohammad Yaqoob (right) have questioned decisionsThe speech, made to Taliban members at a madrassa in the southern city of Kandahar in January 2025, was more fuel to the fire of rumours which had been circulating for months - rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leaderIn late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada]. That's what made the act of turning the internet back on, against his explicit orders, so unexpected, and so notable,\" the expert said.As one Taliban insider put it: this was nothing short of a rebellion.A man of faithOnly two confirmed pictures of Akhundzada exist; this one, showing the supreme leader on the left, has been verified by BBC AfghanHibatullah Akhundzada did not begin his leadership like this.Indeed, sources say he was chosen as the Taliban's supreme leader in 2016 in part because of his approach of building consensus.Lacking battlefield experience himself, he found a deputy in Sirajuddin Haqqani - the feared militant commander, then one of the US's most wanted men with a $10m (£7.4m) bounty on his head.A second deputy was found in Yaqoob Mujahid, Taliban founder Mullah Omar's son – young, but bringing with him his Taliban bloodline, and its potential to unify the movement.The arrangement continued throughout negotiations with Washington in Doha to end the 20-year war between Taliban fighters and US-led forces. The eventual agreement, in 2020, resulted in the sudden and dramatic recapturing of the country by the Taliban, and the chaotic withdrawal of US troops in August 2021.Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe unexpected fall of Kabul in August 2021 saw thousands rush to the airport in the hope of being evacuated with US and other troops as they withdrewTo the outside world, they were a united front.But both deputies would find themselves quietly demoted to ministers as soon as the Taliban returned to power in August 2021, with Akhundzada now a lone power centre, insiders told the BBC.Even Abdul Ghani Baradar - the powerful and influential co-founder of the Taliban who had led negotiations with the US - found himself in the role of deputy prime minister instead of prime minister as many had expected.Instead, Akhundzada - having shunned the capital where the government sits in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban - began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners.Other loyalists were given control of the country's security forces, religious policies and parts of the economy.\"[Akhundzada], from the outset, sought to form his own strong faction,\" a former Taliban member - who later served in Afghanistan's US-backed government - told the BBC.\"Although he lacked the opportunity at first, once he gained power, he began doing so skilfully, expanding his circle using his authority and position.\"Akhundzada has filled his cabinet with loyalists in line with his vision, but those considered the \"Kabul group\" maintain their positions. Here, arguably the most influential members of each group are shownEdicts began to be announced without consultation with Kabul-based Taliban ministers, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education. The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".Men 'who have seen the world'APKabul (pictured) is the capital, and the seat of government for AfghanistanAmong the Kabul group, unhappiness was growing and alliances were strengthening.\"They [the Kabul group] are people who have seen the world,\" one analyst told the BBC. \"Therefore, they believe that their government, in its current form, cannot last.\"The Kabul group want to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women's education and employment.But despite advocating for Afghan women to have more rights, the Kabul group is not described as moderate.Instead, insiders see them as \"pragmatic\", unofficially led by Baradar - the Taliban founding member who still commands great loyalty. He is also thought to be the \"Abdul\" referred to by Donald Trump as the \"head of the Taliban\" during a 2024 US presidential election campaign debate. In fact, he was the group's chief negotiator with the US.The Kabul group's shifting positions have not gone unnoticed.\"We remember that they [the Taliban leaders based in Kabul] used to destroy television sets, but now they appear on TV themselves,\" one analyst said.They also understand the power of social media.Former deputy Yaqoob - whose father led the Taliban during its first rule, when music and television were banned - finds himself increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, evident in gushing TikTok videos and merchandise adorned with his face.But no one has been more effective in rebranding themselves than his fellow former deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani. His ability to evade capture as his network orchestrated some of the most lethal and sophisticated attacks in the Afghan war against US-led forces - including a 2017 truck bombing in Kabul which killed more than 90 civilians near the German embassy - elevated him to near-mythical status among supporters.During this time, only one known photograph of him existed - taken by a BBC Afghan journalist.FBIThe bounty on Sirajuddin Haqqani - pictured in his wanted FBI poster, before the Taliban returned to power - was dropped last yearBut then, six months after the US withdrawal, Haqqani marched out in front of the world's cameras at a graduation ceremony of police officers in Kabul, his face uncovered.It was the first step towards a new image: no longer a militant, but a statesman - one with whom the New York Times would sit down in 2024 and ask: is he Afghanistan's best hope for change?Just a few months later, the FBI would quietly drop the $10m bounty on his head.Yet analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.Arguably the most visible opposition to his edicts had been minor and limited - for example not enforcing regulations like the ban on shaving beards in regions controlled by Kabul group-aligned officials. But larger acts of rebellion have always been considered unthinkable.One former Taliban member emphasised to the BBC that \"obedience to [Akhundzada] is considered mandatory\".Haqqani himself, in his interview with the New York Times, played down any chance of an open split. \"Unity is important for Afghanistan currently so we can have a peaceful country,\" he said.Instead, one analyst said, the Kabul group is choosing to send \"a message to both the international community and Afghans\", one which says: \"We are aware of your complaints and concerns, but what can we do?\"At least, that was the case before the order came to shut down the internet.A breaking pointAFP via Getty ImagesThe internet switch-off began in carefully selected provinces and then expanded to the whole country in late SeptemberThe Taliban's supreme leader is a man with a deep distrust of the internet; he believes its content to be against Islamic teachings, and is so dedicated to his belief that an aide reads out the latest news or social media posts to him each morning instead, his spokesman once explained to the BBC.The Kabul group believe that a modern country cannot survive without it.The supreme leader's internet shutdown order began in provinces controlled by Akhundzada's allies, before it was expanded to the whole country.Sources close to the Kabul group and within the Taliban government described what happened next - an almost unprecedented moment in the Taliban's history.\"It surprised many members of the movement,\" one source said.In short, the Kabul group's most powerful ministers came together and convinced  Kabul-based Prime Minister Mullah Hassan Akhund to order it switched back on.In fact, the group had already made its unhappiness with the edict known before the internet was cut across the country: the group's de-facto leader, Baradar,  travelled to Kandahar to warn one of Akhundzada's most loyal governors that they needed to \"wake him up\" - adding they had to stop being the supreme leader's \"yes\" men.\"You don't tell him the truth openly; whatever he says, you just implement,\" he was reported as saying by a Kandahar insider.His words, the source said, were dismissed. On Monday, 29 September, an order came into the telecommunications ministry directly from the supreme leader to shut everything down. \"No excuses\" would be accepted, a source in the ministry told the BBC.On Wednesday morning, a group of Kabul group ministers - including Baradar, Haqqani and Yaqoob - gathered at the prime minister's office, joined by the telecommunications minister. Here, they urged the Kandahar-aligned prime minister to take charge and reverse the order. According to one source, they told him the full responsibility lay with them.It worked. The internet returned.But perhaps more importantly, within those few days, it was as if what Akhundzada had hinted at in that speech months earlier had come to pass: insiders were threatening Taliban unity.AFP via Getty ImagesThe decision to reverse the order took many by surprise - including Kabul group supportersBut why this order? One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"APBeyond primary school, girls and women are denied an education under the TalibanAfter the internet was turned back on, speculation was rife about what would happen next.A source close to the Kabul group suggested the ministers will be slowly removed or demoted.However, the Kandahar insider suggested it might be the supreme leader who backed down \"because he fears such opposition\".As the year drew to an end, it appeared publicly that nothing had changed.The letter to the UN Security Council noted some UN member states \"have downplayed the division between leaders in Kandahar and Kabul as akin to a family dispute that would not alter the status quo; all senior leaders are invested in the success of the Taliban enterprise\".Zabiullah Mujahid, the senior Taliban government spokesman, has categorically denied any split.\"We will never allow ourselves to be divided,\" he told the BBC in early January 2026. \"All officials and leadership know that a split can be harmful for all, for Afghanistan, religiously prohibited and forbidden by Allah.\"However, he did also acknowledge that differences in \"opinion\" exist among Taliban members, but equated it to \"a difference of opinion in a family\".Half way through December, those \"differences\" had appeared to surface once more.Haqqani was filmed addressing a crowd in his home province of Khost during Friday prayers, warning that anyone who \"gets to power through the nation's trust, love and faith and then abandons or forgets the same nation... is not a government\".The same day, Akhundzada loyalist Neda Mohammad Nadem - the higher education minister - made his own speech to graduating students at a madrassa in a neighbouring province.\"Only one person leads and the rest follow orders, this is a true Islamic government,\" he said. \"If there are too many leaders then problems will emerge and this government that we have achieved will be ruined.\"After the dispute over the internet, these recent comments are set against a very different backdrop to those made by Akhundzada in the leaked audio at the start of 2025.Yet whether 2026 will be the year that the Kabul group move to make meaningful change for the women and men of Afghanistan is very much still up for debate.\"As ever… the question remains after apparent disagreement within the Emirate's top tier – will words ever lead to action?\" says one expert.\"They haven't yet.\"Edited and produced by Zia Shahreyar, Flora Drury and the BBC Afghan Forensics team.

    "body": "UK 'considering options' as Russia expels British diplomat over spy claims2 hours agoSofia Ferreira SantosandOlivia IrelandEPA-EFE/REX/ShutterstockThe UK Foreign Office has said it is \"carefully considering\" a response to Russia expelling a British diplomat.Moscow accused the unidentified man of being an intelligence agent working undercover at the embassy in Russia's capital. He has been stripped of his accreditation and given two weeks to leave the country, according to a statement from Russia's foreign ministry. It added that Danae Dholakia, the British charge d'affaires, had been summoned over the matter.In response, the UK government said Moscow was targeting diplomats out of \"desperation\" and \"actions like this undermine the basic conditions required for diplomatic missions to operate\".Earlier on Thursday, Moscow said it would not tolerate \"undeclared British intelligence officers\" in its territory and warned that it would take further action if London escalates the situation.A UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said this was not the first time the Kremlin had made \"malicious and baseless accusations against our staff\". Diplomatic relations between the UK and Russia have worsened in recent years, with both countries expelling a number of each other's diplomats since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.In March last year, Russia expelled two British officials over accusations of spying, with the UK Foreign Office accusing Moscow of \"malicious and baseless accusations\" against its staff.The UK, in response, revoked accreditation for a Russian diplomat and a diplomatic spouse, saying it would \"not stand for intimidation of British embassy staff and their families\".",

    "body": "5 hours agoHenry ZeffmanChief Political CorrespondentPA MediaThe government is to announce new powers making it easier to mobilise tens of thousands of former armed forces personnel to prepare for war.New rules will mean reservists remain on call for an extra decade, and lower the threshold for them being called into service.The changes will form part of legislation for the armed forces being published in parliament later.While some of its provisions are technical measures the government has to renew at regular intervals, other parts of the legislation are seen by ministers as a crucial part of the conversation about Britain's readiness for conflict.The measures affect the segments of the armed forces reserve who are former service personnel rather than volunteers - known as the strategic reserve.Currently, the age limit for the strategic reserve is 55. This will change to 65.The threshold for members of the strategic reserve to be mobilised will change too. Under existing rules they are called upon in the scenario of \"national danger, great emergency or attack in the UK\". That threshold will be lowered to \"warlike preparations\", which is already the threshold for reservists who have left active service in the past few years.The changes will come into force next year, if passed by parliament.The government estimates that there are around 95,000 members of the strategic reserve.Last year the Strategic Defence Review called on the government to \"reinvigorate the relationship with the strategic reserves\".Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "body": "20 hours agoShayan Sardarizadeh,Merlyn Thomas,BBC VerifyandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianBBCWarning: this story contains content which some readers might find distressingDistressing new videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran showing rows of bodies, blood soaked floors and crowds of people searching for loved ones following a deadly government crackdown on protesters in Iran.The videos analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian, which are too graphic to show, contain some of the most shocking examples so far of how brutal the government's retaliation has been since the unrest began on 28 December.Forensic examination of the footage reveals nearly 200 bodies laid throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16. Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show, though the true figure is likely to be much higher. The near total internet blackout imposed by the government since last week has left more than 90 million Iranians almost completely cut off from the outside world.The number of people who have been killed in the protests is not fully known. US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) places the estimate at more than 2,500. An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed \"terrorists\" were to blame.A black body bag shows the date of birth of a 16-year-old victimBBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see. Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as \"the apocalypse\".The man filming is heard saying, \"Today is Saturday, a day after the call\". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.Body bags laid outside in the courtyard of the mortuary complexA number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: \"There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area\". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.  Verifying Iran protest footage as internet blackout passes 100 hoursSeveral ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.\"Some of our best people have been killed,\" the man filming is heard saying.Iranian state TV has since reported that a \"substantial\" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.Additional reporting by Roja Assadi, Richard Irvine-Brown and Kumar Malhotra",

    "body": "41 minutes agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterPresenter Amol Rajan is to leave BBC Radio 4's Today programme, announcing he intends to launch his own company.He will continue doing some work for the BBC away from news, including hosting quiz show University Challenge and the Radical podcast. In a statement, Rajan said leaving Today \"might be mad\", but added he was \"extremely excited to jump into the great digital Narnia of the creator economy\".It has not yet been confirmed who will replace him on Today, which is the BBC's flagship radio news programme, but the corporation said an announcement would be made \"in due course\".The BBC's editorial rules would likely have prevented Rajan from staying on as the presenter of a news programme while also launching his own company.Rajan has presented Today for nearly five years, having joined in March 2021.He effectively replaced John Humphrys, who had left 18 months earlier, but the programme had continued with fewer presenters during the gap. Before joining Today, Rajan was the media editor for BBC News, and guest presented several major programmes such as The One Show and shows on BBC Radio 2. On Thursday, Rajan said: \"The pips have sounded, and it's time to get my coat.\"He praised the Today team as \"the best of the best\" and \"consistently world class\", adding that he also \"couldn't be prouder\" of his Amol Rajan Interviews series which has run on recent years on BBC Two. However, he continued: \"Twenty years after I first flirted with the idea, I'm extremely excited to jump into the Great Digital Narnia of the Creator Economy, and build my own company. I'll still do Britain's oldest TV quiz and most exciting podcast.\"But Del Boy was my hero growing up, and it's time to unleash my inner entrepreneur.\"He added: \"I am very much not leaving the BBC, Britain's noblest cultural institution, whose Reithian spirit is such a generous gift to a world in flux. It's that world I'm heading for, and I'm excited.\"Today editor Owenna Griffiths described Rajan as an \"exceptional talent with a rare combination of intellectual dexterity, impressive breadth of interest and a brilliant sense of humour\".Radio 4 controller said Rajan had \"brought a distinctive intellectual energy and curiosity to Today that we will be really sad to lose\".In a separate post on Instagram, Rajan praised his Today colleagues and said he had made sure to tell them of his exit before the official announcement. Rajan is the third presenter in two years to leave Today, following Mishal Husain and Martha Kearney, who were replaced by Anna Foster and Emma Barnett respectively.The programme's other presenters are Justin Webb, who joined in 2009, and Nick Robinson, who took over from James Naughtie in 2015.",

    "body": "1 hour agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe Eurovision Song Contest has announced a live tour to celebrate its 70th birthday, which will begin after this year's grand final. The new show will feature some of the most memorable performers from the seven decades of the competition, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) said.It has not yet been confirmed which artists will be taking part, but the organisation confirmed the tour would also feature performances from 10 of this year's entrants.The tour begins at London's O2 arena on 15 June, and will go on to play nine other cities around Europe.The announcement comes during ongoing turmoil surrounding the contest, following a row about Israel's participation while the war in Gaza continues. Ireland, Spain, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Iceland have all said they will not take part this year, after a majority of members voted in December for a series of reforms which would also allow Isreal to remain.Earlier this week, Thomas Neuwirth, who won the contest in 2014 as his stage persona Conchita Wurst, stepped back from his association with Eurovision, saying he planned \"to focus more on other professional projects and to let new things evolve\".Meanwhile, Polish artist Karolina Czarnecka, alongside her band Brutto Szkła, announced this week she was withdrawing from the competition to find Poland's 2026 entrant because she cannot \"consent to the suffering of another human being\".Artists participating in the new tour will perform their own Eurovision entries, plus cover versions of their favourite songs from the contest's 70-year history, organisers said.The contest's director Martin Green said organisers \"wanted to do something truly unique and special\" to mark the anniversary. He said the format of the tour would \"capture the evolution of the contest\" and \"celebrate our fantastic past whilst looking to the future\".\"For the very first time we are bringing the magic of the Eurovision Song Contest live experience directly to fans and their friends and families all over Europe,\" he added.The line-up of 2026 artists taking part in the tour will not be announced until after this year's contest has taken place, suggesting only the artists that do well in the contest or deliver a particularly memorable performance will be selected. The EBU said the live tour gives fans who were not able to secure tickets to the contest itself \"the chance to attend a show that would deliver the \"scale, spectacle and spirit\" of the contest.The tour will play shows in Hamburg, Milan, Zürich, Antwerp, Cologne, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Paris and Stockholm.The Eurovision Song Contest began in May 1956 in Switzerland, and has evolved to become one of the biggest events in the musical calendar - last year's contest was watched by 175 million people worldwide.This year's contest takes place in Vienna on 16 May, following Austria's win in 2025.",

    "body": "The son of a British couple detained in Iran has expressed his concern for their welfare after the UK's embassy was closed in Tehran amid the deadly crackdown on anti-regime protests.Joe Bennett's parents, Craig and Lindsay Foreman, were on a trip around the world when they were arrested by Iranian authorities in January last year and charged with spying.Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, Bennett said the couple are in a \"dangerous position\" and that there was \"overcrowding\" in the jail due to the protests.He added that the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) told him they were still \"assessing the situation\".The FCDO previously told the BBC it continued to raise the case of the Foremans directly with the Iranian authorities.The UK government announced the temporary closure of its embassy in Tehran on Wednesday, saying it would now operate remotely. \"We have temporarily closed the British Embassy in Tehran, this will now operate remotely. Foreign Office travel advice has now been updated to reflect this consular change,\" a government spokesperson said.Britain's ambassador and all consular staff were evacuated based on a security assessment and concerns for staff safety.Bennett said if his parents were released, they had planned to go to the British embassy. \"The trouble is, their plan was to go to the embassy, was to try to get to the embassy because they feel that that's safe ground and now... Where do they go? What do they do?\" he said.Bennett, who last spoke to his parents on Wednesday, said during the brief communication he's been able to have, they've told him of the \"unsafe\" and \"frightening\" conditions of the prison.\"There are vermin in the kitchen and in beds. It is overcrowded, it's even more overcrowding now that these protests have gone on in Tehran,\" he said.He added there were \"fights that break out pretty much daily\" which he could hear in the background during the phone calls with his mother. Last year, Scottish National Party MP Brendan O'Hara told the BBC the couple were being used \"bargaining chips\" between Iran's government and the West.Bennett also expressed the family's \"frustration\" with the perceived lack of support from the government to secure his parents' release.\"I look at other nations, France for example, US, Italy, when their citizens are put in a similar situation, there's an advocacy from them at the highest level of government... and the UK haven't done that,\" he said.The family just wanted the government to show \"a sign of solidarity\" with their plight, Bennett added.The Foreman's legal representatives in Iran formally submitted an application for bail this week.Both of their Iranian defence lawyers have also written to the court, stating that the pair were innocent and that there was no lawful basis for their continued detention, according to the family.As Iran continues its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests which has killed at least 2,400 people according to a human rights agency, Bennett said he just wants to ensure his parents' safe return.\"My mum and Craig are two innocent UK citizens that are caught up in the middle of all of this. So for us, it's about their safety and prompt return home however that comes,\" he said.",

    "body": "55 minutes agoKate WhannelPolitical reporterHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has backed calls for a debate on banning under 16-year-olds from social media.Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the government had to \"get the balance right\" and \"protect young people from the harm\".In December, Australia introduced a law requiring social media platforms to block under-16s from having accounts with their sites and privately, many Labour MPs and officials have said they expect that the UK government to follow their example.Next week, the House of Lords is set to vote on proposals for a ban, which, if passed, could see pressure grow on the government.Last week, the Conservatives announced they would block under-16s from social media platforms, as well as prohibiting smartphones in schools, if they won the next election.Tory party leader Kemi Badenoch said \"addictive\" social media apps \"correlates quite strongly\" with a rise in mental health problems among young people. Labour Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has said he agrees with \"a lot of what Kemi Badenoch is saying\" on social media use.Earlier this week, Meta announced it had blocked about 500,000 accounts on its sites including Facebook and Instagram during its first week of compliance with the new law in Australia. The UK government has said it will be monitoring how the Australian ban works. Some Labour MPs and officials have privately expressed frustration that Badenoch and Burnham have been able to get ahead of the government on the issue.\"It's where we will inevitably end up. It's what the public and parents want. I don't know what's keeping us so long,\" one senior government source said.This week's confrontation with X over Grok AI, on which Downing Street is claiming \"vindication\", might embolden the government to have another battle with the big technology companies.The issue could come to a head next week, with the House of Lords likely to vote on an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill which would prevent under-16s from accessing social media. It has been tabled by Lord Nash, a Conservative former education minister, but is jointly-sponsored by Baroness Benjamin, the Liberal Democrat peer and former children's TV presenter; the Labour peer Baroness Berger and Baroness Cass, an independent member of the House of Lords, who is a paediatrician.Those involved in the amendment are optimistic it will pass. If it does, the House of Commons would have to hold a binding vote on the issue in the next few months.Asked if the government would implement a ban, Streeting said he was \"really glad\" the prime minister had \"encouraged debate\" on the subject.\"This is not just a debate worthy of our time but a debate past time.\"This has been the conversation at school gates, in parent WhatsApp groups and  Facebook groups.\"He said social media could create \"greater connections and a sense of belonging\" but also came with risks including the \"harm of addling the developing mind of young people\".\"And then there's really sinister, extreme stuff,\" he added citing exposure to pornography, grooming or violent extremism. \"We've got to think about traditional approaches in the modern setting.\"No one would dispute when I was growing up that being able to use tools like hammers or a saw was a good skill set for us to learn as young people.\"What would never happen was a nursery or primary school child being given a box of nails and left unattended with it. That's kind of what we have done with mobile phones.\"The Molly Rose Foundation, a suicide prevention charity, has expressed concerns about the \"unintended consequences of bans\" arguing that they risk \"pushing harm to unregulated areas rather than making products safe by design for children\". Andy Burrows, chief executive of the foundation, said: \"Government should respond to overwhelming calls from parents for decisive action by fixing regulation with evidence-based solutions, not simplistic and populist calls for social media bans that would risk causing more harm than good.\"They should immediately publish the review into smartphones and social media that they have been sitting on for six months so parents can see what the evidence actually says, and government can act swiftly and decisively to protect children by doing what's right not simply what's easy.\"A spokesperson for the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology said the study would be \"published in due course\" adding: \"We are considering next steps in light of its conclusions.\"\"We are committed to keeping children safe online and will continue to develop policy informed by the best available evidence.\"",

    "body": "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is not planning to seek a move away from the club this month.Reports have emerged in recent days suggesting Fernandes is considering his future at Old Trafford following the dismissal of head coach Ruben Amorim.Fernandes met one of Amorim's coaches, Carlos Fernandes, in the wake of Amorim's sacking, heightening fears for some that the 31-year-old might be looking for an exit route.However, sources with an understanding of the situation say that despite the upheaval, which led to Darren Fletcher being made interim boss for two games and Michael Carrick taking over as caretaker for the rest of the season, Fernandes remains committed to the club.It was always his plan to reassess the situation in the summer, when he will have one year left on his contract.Despite turning down a huge offer from Al-Hilal last summer and continued interest from the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes would look to stay in Europe if he did leave United.The former Sporting player admitted recently he was \"hurt\" by the knowledge United were willing to sell him and said he felt senior officials lacked the courage to tell him because Amorim's preference was for Fernandes to stay.",

    "body": "31 minutes agoAngus CochraneSenior political journalist, BBC ScotlandPA MediaNigel Farage unveiled Lord Offord at an event in Fife Former Conservative minister Lord Offord has been named as Reform UK's Scottish leader.The ex-Scottish Tory treasurer was unveiled by party leader Nigel Farage at an event in Fife.He will lead the party into May's Scottish Parliament election, with Reform aiming to make a major electoral breakthrough north of the border. At the event, Farage confirmed that he had held talks with Robert Jenrick, who had just been sacked from the Conservative frontbench for \"plotting to defect\". Lord Offord - who is stepping down from the Lords and standing for election to Holyrood - said he saw the election as a \"two-horse race\" with the SNP.He said the party had more than 12,000 members in Scotland and a \"really talented group of candidates\".Lord Offord insisted the party would run a \"positive\" campaign after being questioned about a Reform UK social media advert featuring Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar that was branded \"blatantly racist\".PA MediaLord Offord signed his application to retire from the House of Lords at the press conference Farage said about 100 Scottish candidates had undergone vetting and training in London.The Reform UK leader told reporters: \"I think we can surprise ourselves with just how many votes we manage to garner in these elections.\"He added: \"A huge chunk of the Scottish electorate are looking for something different. And they're tired of the decline this country has seen under SNP government.\"Farage spoke as UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced that she had sacked Tory shadow secretary Jenrick for \"plotting to defect\".The Reform leader confirmed he had spoken with Jenrick and \"a number of very senior Conservatives\".He said that for all of the talk of a supposed \"Kemi bounce\" a lot of Conservative senior politicians realise that the Tories will be \"obliterated\" in elections in Scotland, Wales and England in May.Farage denied that he had signed a deal with Jenrick, but said he had \"little doubt\" that leaving the Conservatives to join Reform had been in the Tory frontbencher's mind.It was widely speculated that Lord Offord would be lined up to lead the party in Scotland following his defection from the Tories in December. Several recent polls have suggested that Reform are on track to challenge Labour for second place behind the SNP in May's election.The party has one MSP, Graham Simpson, who defected from the Conservatives in August. Last month, Reform secured its first success at the ballot box in Scotland by winning a council by-election in West Lothian.Lord Offord served as a Tory frontbencher between 2021 and 2024.Until December, he had been the party's energy spokesman in the House of Lords.The former minister announced last month that he intended to step down from the Lords and run as a Reform candidate for Holyrood. As a life peer, Lord Offord's peerage cannot be relinquished. However, he has applied to retire as a member of the House of Lords from 30 January, signing his resignation letter on stage with Farage. The Scottish Parliament is currently considering a bill - tabled by Reform MSP Simpson - that would bar MSPs from also sitting as MPs or members of the House of Lords.Who is Malcolm Offord?Lord Offord, who founded investment firm Badenoch and Co, was director of the Vote No Borders campaign during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.He entered frontline politics in 2021 after being named a life peer by Boris Johnson, having previously donated almost £150,000 to the Conservative Party.He became Baron Offord of Garvel and was appointed as a junior minister in the Scotland Office.Lord Offord also served as a minister of exports from 2023 until the general election in 2024.",

    "body": "12 hours agoEmily HoltGetty ImagesHave you lost count of the times you've had high hopes for a pot plant but despite careful positioning and diligent watering it always seems to die?Well you're not cursed and you don't need particularly green fingers for your to foliage to thrive, you just need to know where you might be going wrong, experts say.Gardeners' World host Adam Frost and the Royal Horticultural Society's Clare Preston-Pollitt share their top tips for keeping your house plants alive and healthy. 1. Pick the right plantFrom left to right: monstera, peace lily, devils ivy [top], false castor oil plant suit different roomsMany of us pick plants we think are pretty but making sure they are compatible with the conditions in our homes is key for survival, says Clare, RHS Garden Bridgewater's horticultural advisor.\"I think lots of people buy plants that they like the look of... take them home, and then watch them slowly look sicker over a series of months,\" she explains. Often this can simply be \"because it's in the wrong place\", so don't be afraid to try moving a plant around the house to give it a new lease of life, she advises.Clare says bright lounge areas, with lots of light, are ideal for monsteras, while warm and humid kitchens suit peace lilies. She also recommends devil's ivy for a bathroom which will see lots of moisture, and a false caster oil plant for a shady room or hallway. 2. Don't overwater A common mistake is overwatering. Rather than assuming all plants need the same amount, it's important to learn their individual requirements. For common house plants like peace lilies and spider plants, brown leaves are a tell-tale sign of over or under watering. Check the dryness of the soil before topping them up.For others, like cacti and succulents, Clare says we mistakenly drown them by unnecessarily watering them. Adam explains these types of plants just need a gentle mist of water to keep them looking fresh. Clare suggests using a water mat or watering globe which can slowly deliver liquid to your plant. According to Clare, a cast iron plant, a Hoya carnosa and a snake plant (above) are the hardest to kill.These plants are very \"drought-tolerant\" meaning they can survive for a long time without being watered. The snake and cast iron plant can also tolerate darker areas in your home.3. Water less in winterGetty ImagesIt's important to adjust how you care for your plant throughout the seasons. \"In spring and summer, you can water more regularly,\" says Clare, as plants are \"actively\" growing during this time.At the height of summer some plants, like a monstera, can be watered two or three times a week. It's also important to \"feed\" them at this time by adding plant food to the soil to ensure they have enough nutrients. But by autumn and winter, Clare says this treatment should be the opposite. Foliage plants go into a \"semi-dormant state\" as light levels lower during these months. This means soil doesn't need to be fed and plants require much less watering. Clare recommends waiting until soil is completely dry before adding more water. It's also important to repot your plant to keep it healthy. Clare says it's best to do this in spring, when plants are growing and can establish roots more easily. Signs it is time to repot include roots binding together at the bottom and sides or creeping through the holes. Also water flooding straight out of the pot holes is a sign it is time to upsize, says Clare.4. Keep your Christmas poinsettia warmGetty ImagesFor many of us, our first foray into foliage begins at Christmas when we are gifted a poinsettia. But by now in early January those crimson leaves are probably already looking crumpled.The trick with these festive fellows is to respect their Mexican origins to help them put down roots in our much colder climate, says Adam.\"It's going to want that warmth, it's not going to want to be in a drafty spot,\" he says - but they should be kept out of direct sunlight.They do not need a lot of watering so only do so when dry, he says.To avoid overwatering you can place the pot inside a water container every day before moving it back to its original spot, or gently misting with a spray. To keep them lasting longer than your New Years resolutions, you should add plant food to your poinsettias each month, Adam says. In April, he suggests trimming the branches, before re-potting in May. From September, it should be moved into a darker space for at least 12 hours a day, as this ensures the bracts turn red, ready for the next festive season. Other stories you may enjoy",

Maryam had been fatally shot - and they had no idea where the bullet had come from.Reza carried Maryam's body for an hour and a half. Exhausted, he sat down in an alley. After a short time, the door of a nearby house opened. The people who lived there took them into their garage, brought a white sheet and wrapped Maryam's body in it.Days before Maryam headed out to the protests, she had told her children - aged seven and 14 – about what was happening in their country. \"Sometimes parents go to the protests and don't come back,\" she said. \"My blood, and yours, is no more precious than anyone else's.\"Reza and Maryam's names have been changed for safety reasons.Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting via WANA via ReutersIranian state television has shown this burnt-out bus, saying it was filmed in Tehran on 10 JanuaryMaryam is one of thousands of protesters who should have returned home but never did, as the authorities responded to the rapid spread of demonstrations across Iran with a deadly crackdown.The US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has been able to confirm the killing of at least 2,400 protesters, including 12 children, during the past three weeks.It is extremely difficult to determine the death toll, which is expected to rise in the coming days, because the country remains under a near-total internet blackout imposed by Iranian authorities on Thursday night.  Human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is unable to report on the ground.Iranian authorities have not provided a death toll but local media have reported 100 security personnel have been killed, and protesters - whom they have portrayed as \"rioters and terrorists\" - have set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryDemonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers.Security forces soon launched a violent crackdown, with at least 34 protesters reported killed by 7 January, the 11th day of the unrest. However, it appears the bloodiest crackdown was last Thursday and Friday, when thousands of people took to the streets across the country and called for an end to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.BBC Persian has received dozens of accounts from inside Iran. Defiant despite potential repercussions, the witnesses said they wanted to ensure the rest of the world knew of the violence against the protesters.User generated contentA demonstration outside Hoze Elmiye religious institution, in Najaf Abad, on 8 January\"Our neighbourhood smells of blood - they killed so many,\" one told BBC Persian. Another recalled security forces \"mostly shooting at heads and faces\".The protests have spread across all 31 provinces. And the information trickling in clearly shows the scale of the killings in smaller cities and towns is just as severe as in major cities.In Tonekabon, a town of 50,000 people in the north, Sorena Golgun was killed on Friday. The 18-year-old university student was \"shot in the heart\" running from an ambush by security forces, according to a family member.Family of Sorena GolgunSorena Golgun's family say the 18-year-old university student was shot in his heart running from security forces in TonekabonLike Sorena, many of the other protesters killed were young and full of dreams. Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.Not all those killed were protesters. Navid Salehi, a 24-year-old nurse in Kermanshah, was shot multiple times leaving work on Thursday.The bodies of many protesters were sent to the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre, in Tehran. The scenes there were so distressing Sahanand, who did not want to give his real name, decided to travel almost 1,000km to a border area so he could send out video footage by using the mobile data networks of neighbouring countries. On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.User generated contentKashani, Tehran, on 8 JanuaryOne young woman, speaking to BBC Persian on condition of anonymity, described last week's events as like \"a war\". The protesters remained \"more united than ever before\" but it was too much for her and this week she had fled the country - like many, gripped by fear the authorities will start a new wave of executions and prosecutions.\"I'm really afraid of what might happen to those who are still in Iran,\" she added.Additional reporting by Farzad Seifikaran and Hasan Solhjou",

    "body": "17 minutes agoHarry FarleyPolitical correspondentGetty ImagesWest Sussex is among the councils requesting an elections delayMore than a third of eligible councils in England have asked to postpone their elections due in May, affecting more than 2.5 million voters.The government is carrying out a major overhaul of local government structures.Twenty-three councils want to postpone their ballots to help deliver that reorganisation - but opposition parties say Labour is \"running scared\" of voters.Most wanting a delay are Labour-led, but two are Conservative-led and one is Liberal Democrat. Some of the councils that have asked for a delay are run by more than one party, or independents.Last month ministers told 63 local authorities they would authorise delays to the polls if there were \"genuine concerns\" about delivering them alongside the government's overhaul of local government.So far, 23 have requested a delay, 33 have not and seven are yet to confirm their position.Elections would be postponed for a year with the expectation they would take place in 2027.Ministers are expected to approve the requests in the coming days.The BBC contacted the 63 councils who could request a delay to their May elections to ask for their decision.The government's rejig of local government will replace the two-tier system of district and county councils that exists in many parts of England with new 'unitary' councils responsible for delivering all councils services in their area.It means some of the councils up for election this year will be folded into new unitary councils in 2027 or 2028, so councillors could only be in office for a year.Ministers say their reorganisation of local council will be the biggest in a generation, removing duplication and simplifying local government.Writing for The Times, Local Government Secretary Steve Reed said: \"Running a series of elections for short-lived zombie councils will be costly, time consuming and will take scarce resources away from front-line services like fixing pot holes and social care.\"The Conservatives and the Lib Dems have both criticised Labour's decision to allow elections to be postponed, whilst Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice told the BBC that authorities wanting a delay were \"terrified\" his party would win.Conservative shadow local government secretary accused Labour of \"running scared of voters,\" with the government struggling in the polls.\"We are clear that these elections should go ahead. Ministers should treat voters with respect instead of disdain, stop undermining our democratic system and let the people of this country make their own decisions,\" he added.Council protestsLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who has previously suggested delaying elections breached human rights, called for a change in the law so \"ministers cannot simply delay elections at the stroke of a pen\".He said: \"Both Labour and the Conservatives are running scared of the electorate, allowing councillors to serve terms of up to seven years without a democratic mandate.\"Despite their parties' official positions, the Conservative leaders of West Sussex, and East Sussex County Councils, and the Liberal Democrat controlled Cheltenham Borough Council are among those requesting a delay.Protests erupted at some councils over decisions to ask for a delay, with police called to a meeting in Redditch where the Labour-run district council in Worcestershire discussed asking for a postponement.Some councils have yet to announce their decision.The Conservative leader of Essex County Council told the government there was \"huge strain on our systems\" on top of the planned restructure. But he said it was up to the government whether this year's elections would go ahead, and said he would not call for a delay. Here is the full list of councils have said they want to postpone their elections.Adur Borough CouncilBasildon Borough CouncilBlackburn with Darwen CouncilBurnley Borough CouncilCheltenham Borough CouncilChorley Borough CouncilCrawley Borough CouncilEast Sussex County CouncilExeter City CouncilHastings Borough CouncilHyndburn Borough CouncilIpswich Borough CouncilNorwich City CouncilNuneaton and Bedworth Borough CouncilPendle Borough CouncilPeterborough City CouncilPreston City CouncilRedditch Borough CouncilRugby Borough CouncilStevenage Borough CouncilThurrock CouncilWest Sussex County CouncilWorthing Borough Council",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fifa president Gianni Infantino gave US president Donald Trump the inaugural Fifa Peace Prize in DecemberBySports editorA group of cross-party MPs have called on Fifa to consider expelling the United States from the World Cup until the country demonstrates \"clear compliance with international law and respect for the sovereignty of other nations\".It follows the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid on the capital city Caracas this month, along with warnings that US president Donald Trump has recently issued to a host of other countries.So with the US due to host both the World Cup and Olympics over the next two and a half years, what questions does America's foreign policy raise for sports organisations, and could any take a stand?'Repeated veiled and overt threats'Back in December, Fifa awarded Trump its inaugural 'Peace Prize' at the 2026 World Cup draw ceremony in Washington, saying he had \"played a pivotal role\" in establishing a ceasefire and promoted peace between Israel and Palestine, and that he has sought to end other conflicts.In the few weeks since, the US has taken military action in both Venezuela and Nigeria and has hinted at possible further operations in Greenland, fellow World Cup co-host Mexico, and two other participants in the tournament - Colombia and Iran.Now, 23 politicians from Labour, the Lib Dems, Green Party and Plaid Cymru have signed a motion, external in parliament, calling on international sporting bodies to consider expelling the US from major international competitions, including the World Cup. They say such events \"should not be used to legitimise or normalise violations of international law by powerful states\".The MPs express concern about the \"escalation of US actions against Venezuela\", including \"the kidnapping of President Nicolas Maduro\", claiming that they amount to \"a direct intervention in the internal affairs of a sovereign state\".Their motion also notes \"repeated veiled and overt threats made by senior US officials\", towards Denmark, Colombia and Cuba\", saying it \"undermines the rules-based international order\".Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The United States launched a military strike on Venezuela and captured president Nicolas Maduro on 3 JanuaryWhat has the US done and said?While the White House is yet to respond to the BBC about the MPs' motion, it has previously claimed that the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug-trafficking and terrorism. Trump said the US will now control Venezuela and its oil industry.Maduro insists he is a prisoner of war, and Trump faced strong criticism at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action.Meanwhile, Trump has also told Cuba to \"make a deal\" over Venezuelan oil exports \"before it is too late\", and said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\".As with Venezuela, Trump has accused Colombia of not doing enough to tackle drug trafficking. Colombia president Gustavo Petro has told the BBC that he believes there is now a \"real threat\" of US military action against his country.Trump has also claimed that drugs are \"pouring\" through Mexico into America, adding \"we're gonna have to do something\", amid reports that he has started planning a mission to send in US troops. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum says she has rejected any US military action on Mexican soil.Trump has also insisted his country needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons and has not ruled out using military force. The mineral-rich Arctic territory is controlled by Denmark, a fellow Nato member, and potentially also in the World Cup if its team comes through the play-offs. The Trump administration has also faced mounting scrutiny over the legality of air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific.Could Fifa act?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianni Infantino was elected president of Fifa in February 2016Fifa declined to comment on the MPs' motion, and whether it may now reconsider the annual awarding of its peace prize in light of Trump's recent foreign policy.But few believe it will take any action against a country that is hosting the majority of its matches at the World Cup, especially given the close relationship the governing body's president Gianni Infantino has cultivated with Trump.Such ties have led to accusations that Fifa has become politicised, although it insists that as an organiser of football events it has a statutory duty to remain neutral. This is not the first time Fifa has come under pressure over the political actions of a World Cup host. In 2018, the tournament went ahead in Russia despite the country annexing Crimea four years earlier. Russia also stood accused of cyber attacks, meddling in western elections and carrying out the Novichok nerve agent attack in Salisbury.However, comparisons have also been drawn with the way Fifa subsequently banned Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, a sanction that remains in place.\"Let's have consistency,\" Brian Leishman, one of the MPs who has signed the motion, told the Daily Mirror when asked about the US action in Venezuela. \"It's an invasion of a sovereign nation and the kidnap of a president in Venezuela. I'm very critical of Maduro, I want to be very clear on that, but what we've seen is a breach of international law. When you see how Russia has been treated, which is absolutely correct, I just want there to be consistency.\"Some at Fifa privately point out that the Russian Football Union is still a member association and that the ban on playing internationals was more down to teams refusing to play against Russia and security concerns, rather than the governing body taking a moral position.An insight into Fifa's approach came in October when Infantino said Fifa \"cannot solve geopolitical problems\" amid pressure to sanction Israel after a United Nations commission of inquiry concluded that it had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\".What about the Olympics?The International Olympic Committee (IOC) also maintains a ban on Russian teams at the Games, with individual athletes only allowed to compete as neutrals, as long as they are admitted by the relevant sporting federations.However, it has ruled out the exclusion of any American athletes from February's Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina in Italy.In a statement issued to BBC Sport, it said: \"As a global organisation, the IOC has to manage a complex reality. The IOC has to deal with the current political context and the latest developments in the world. \"The ability to bring athletes together, no matter where they come from, is fundamental to the future of values-based, truly global sport, which can give hope to the world.\"For this reason, the IOC cannot involve itself directly in political matters or conflicts between countries, as these fall outside our remit. This is the realm of politics.\"Last year, the IOC also rejected calls to bar Israel over the Gaza war, stating that the country's national Olympic committee had complied with the Olympic Charter.IOC sources have told BBC Sport a distinction has to be made with Russia because  it took over Ukrainian territory and put athletes there under the control of the Russian Olympic Committee, which is against the Olympic Charter.Los Angeles is hosting the Olympics in 2028.'A looming stress-test'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The 2026 World Cup will feature 48 teams for the first timeSome believe that, depending on Trump's next moves, the situation could become harder for sports bodies to navigate.\"Fifa and the IOC could be heading towards one almighty headache,\" according to John Zerafa, a veteran advisor to countries and cities wanting to host major sports events.\"Both organisations' charters emphasise peace, respect for sovereignty, and non-discrimination.\"In Russia's case, that led to bans and restrictions on athletes and teams. If, in a worst-case scenario, the US were to use force against Greenland - a Nato ally's territory - would those same principles apply? If Denmark qualifies via the play-offs, would it boycott the World Cup? Would European or Nato leaders refuse to attend US-hosted events?\"This isn't just geopolitics. It's a looming stress-test for sporting institutions that pride themselves on neutrality, yet repeatedly find themselves forced to take political positions when international law and conflict collide with global competition.\"Trump's tougher immigration policies could also have an impact on the World Cup, which begins on 11 June.Fifa and US authorities have promised a welcoming and unifying tournament, but there are now four competing countries - Iran, Haiti, Senegal and Ivory Coast - whose fans face full or partial travel bans, with the White House referencing a need to manage security threats. For other fans, a programme designed to shorten wait times for interviews for visitor visas for those with tickets has been brought in. Meanwhile, domestic tensions in the US have intensified after Renee Good, 37, was shot dead by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, triggering large protests in the city.Even before the incident, human rights organisations had claimed the World Cup was at increasing danger of being \"weaponised for authoritarian aims\", external and criticised \"escalating attacks on immigrants in the US... and threats to press freedom and the rights of peaceful protesters\".As Fifa's biggest-ever tournament approaches it will be fascinating to see what further impact US action overseas has on ticket sales, collaboration between the co-hosts on issues such as security, and whether sports bodies feel they need to do more to navigate a complicated geopolitical landscape.",

    "body": "3 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesThe government has launched its first ever UK Town of Culture competition, where towns of all sizes across the country can enter to tell their \"unique stories\".First announced in October 2025, the event is part the government's effort to \"restore pride in communities\", and encourages applicants to showcase local visions and voices through a cultural programme.Three finalists will be chosen by an expert panel, where the winner will be awarded a £3m prize, and the two runners-up each receiving £250,000.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said towns have \"shaped our national story for decades\" and the competition was a chance for them to \"make a real difference in their local community\".The event intends to complement the quadrennial UK City of Culture, with applications for the 2029 edition already underway - Bradford won the title in 2025.In a press release, the government said the plan is part of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's \"ambition to restore pride in every part of Britain\".Towns can begin submitting their bids now and the strongest candidates will progress to a shortlist, with each shortlisted town receiving £60,000 in funding.Leading the panel for UK Town of Culture 2028 will be Sir Phil Redmond, who said the competition is a opportunity for local communities celebrate their towns.\"UK Town of Culture asks what makes your town special? What makes its people proud to be there? And why should that be celebrated?\" he said.It follows the government's Pride in Place Programme launched in November 2025, where Labour pledged to provide up to £10bn in funding to 244 towns across the country.",

    "body": "7 hours agoChris MasonPolitical editorDitching his plans to make digital ID mandatory for workers in the UK is an almighty backtracking and dilution of one of the prime minister's flagship policy ideas of the autumn.I remember the first time Sir Keir Starmer talked publicly about his plans, because he was talking to me when he did so.It was September, and we were sheltering from the pouring rain, in an outside metal stairwell next to a giant ship being built by BAE Systems on the banks of the Clyde in Glasgow.What he had to say that day was rather overshadowed by the swirling storm around his then Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, who 24 hours later was out of a job.What those around him were describing as \"phase 2\" of his government was already off to a bumpy start, but digital ID was seen as a defining idea of the parliament that the prime minister could own and then lean into the arguments it provokes with his opponents, within his party and beyond it.The thing is it provoked a lot of arguments, perhaps more than he had anticipated, including among some Labour MPs.It was the mandatory element that became the magnet for the stickiest criticisms.The idea cratered in popularity. It revived so many of the arguments that nuked the last Labour government's plans for ID cards about two decades ago.The sense from critics of an overbearing state, a \"show us your papers\" society.So what have ministers done? They have junked the mandatory element of it.People will still have to digitally prove they have the right to work – but could use other things to do it.This new government digital ID will not be essential.The argument I hear within government is they are ditching the bit that is unpopular, but keeping something people might choose to use themselves because it could make accessing public services easier, for instance.In short, the whole initial public pitch for why digital ID was a good idea - cracking down on illegal migration and illegal working - has been shelved.The emphasis now is on digital ID being an aide to consumers.\"Let's remove the whole culture war thing entirely and focus on the pragmatic element plenty of people will like and will choose to use,\" is how one government figure put it to me.Others say if the prime minister really is going to focus on the cost of living when he is addressing domestic policies, he needed to junk unpopular stuff that was getting in the way of that.The opposition parties have piled in with their criticisms, while welcoming the government's change of heart.Here is the political challenge for Downing Street: the climbdowns, dilutions, U- turns, about turns, call them what you will, are mounting up.In just the last couple of weeks, there has been the issue of business rates on pubs in England and inheritance tax on farmers.Before that, among others, income tax, benefits cuts and winter fuel payments.Sir Keir Starmer's critics, external and internal, are taking note.Just hours before this latest backtracking, the Health Secretary Wes Streeting – who'd quite fancy being prime minister himself one day – said it was important the government \"gets it right first time\".That, to put it very politely, is a work in progress for Sir Keir Starmer.",

Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Sutherland \"entered a ride-share vehicle, physically assaulted the driver (the victim), and made criminal threats\" in an incident at 00:15 PST (08:15 GMT) on Monday. The victim was not injured in the incident, the LAPD added.Sutherland, 59, was released after paying a bond of $50,000 (£37,000). He is due to appear in court on 2 February. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment.The incident took place at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood and is under investigation by the LAPD's Hollywood Division.Sutherland, known for roles such as special agent Jack Bauer on Fox's 24, and as the US president in Designated Survivor, is the son of actor Donald Sutherland.The British-Canadian actor has been arrested several times in the past, and in 2007 he was sentenced to 48 days in jail for driving under the influence and violating probation.He was arrested for assault in 2009, although the charge was later dropped, and was most recently arrested after making an illegal U-turn in Hollywood in 2020.",

    "body": "You must have heard of Dubai chocolate: the sticky, indulgent confectionary filled with pistachio cream, tahini and shreds of knafeh pastry, which has become a global sensation.Now the decadent bar has inspired South Korea's latest dessert craze. The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. \"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. \"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily.

    "body": "3 hours agoDonald Trump's message to Iranians protesting against the regime dominates Wednesday's front pages. The Guardian quotes the US president with its headline \"help is on its way\", which the paper says is the \"clearest sign\" he may be preparing for military action against Tehran.The Daily Telegraph echoes Trump's pledge, spotlighting a photo of protesters in Iran holding up signs calling for America's help. The paper also reports that senior US national security and military officials met on Tuesday to discuss the Iranian government's violent crackdown, which has led to the deaths of around 2,000 people.The Financial Times follows with a \"dispatch from Tehran\", quoting protesters on the streets who say: \"We get killed if we go out.\"In news closer to home, the Times reports on the prime minister's \"U-turn over compulsory digital IDs\". The prime minister has abandoned plans to make the IDs mandatory to gain employment. Government sources tell the paper the cards will instead be optional, and workers will be able to verify their identity with other documents.The Daily Mail adds that the PM abandoning plans for mandatory digital IDs is the \"13th U-turn\" of his tenure.Staying with the government, plans for new rail links between major Northern cities will be unveiled on Wednesday, according to the i Paper. The next phase of the project is due to start in the 2030s and includes a new route between Liverpool and Manchester, the paper reports.\"The rail deal\" is the Daily Mirror's take on the government's \"Northern Powerhouse pledge\" for new lines and infrastructure. It quotes the PM saying: \"This government is rolling up its sleeves to deliver change.\"A court has been told a Russian ship captain did \"absolutely nothing\" to avoid a collision with a US tanker that killed one of his crew in the North Sea, the Metro says. The trial for the incident - which happened in March 2025 - has started, with the captain pleading not guilty as he is accused of \"grossly negligent conduct\".The Daily Express features a warning from campaigners that the total number of elderly people living in poverty risks exceeding two million. The paper refers to research by Age UK that says pensioners are taking \"drastic measures\" to make ends meet, including skipping meals and cutting their electricity use. Pubs are expected to be hit by higher prices as a hike in alcohol duty kicks in due to the Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Budget, the Sun says. The paper's front page pictures a smiling Reeves at the pump with the headline, \"the inn reaper\". Finally, the Daily Star focuses on Trump's interest in Greenland. The paper splashes on a picture released by the White House of the US president staring out a window at a map of Greenland, describing it as an \"arctic troll\". Donald Trump's promise to protestors in Iran that \"help is on the way\" is the main story for the Daily Telegraph. The paper says it's spoken to medics in Tehran who say the healthcare system is buckling amid mass casualties and chronic understaffing. It quotes one doctor as saying: \"There are rivers of blood in hospitals here.\"The Guardian says Trump's remarks are the clearest sign yet that he may be preparing for military action against Tehran.The government's U-turn on making digital ID cards \"mandatory\" for people who want to work is the lead in the Times. The paper says the prime minister had previously put migration at the heart of the rationale for the cards, but there were concerns about the cost and complexity of the scheme.It quotes one government source as saying they didn't want to risk there being cases of a \"65-year-old in a rural area being barred from working because he hasn't downloaded this app\". Another source source said the government \"remained committed\" to a requirement that right-to-work checks are carried out digitally.The Mirror leads with details of Northern Powerhouse Rail, the £45bn programme which will include new rail lines built to Manchester and upgrades to services in West Yorkshire. The paper says ministers are also expected to promise a new version of HS2's axed leg between Birmingham and Manchester.The i Paper warns there is only £1.1bn of firm funding in place for the project, and no start or completion date yet.The impact of the Budget on pubs is the focus for the Sun. It says drinkers will be paying 4p more for a pint for Guinness from April, and that other drinks will have their alcohol content reduced because of next month's rise in alcohol duty.The paper says it's a \"double whammy\" for the hospitality industry after the chancellor raised business rates for pubs as well. A Treasury spokesperson said it was determined to support the Great British pub. The Sun's headline calls Rachel Reeves: \"The Inn Reaper.\"Related Internet Links",

    "body": "Venezuela has started releasing multiple Americans detained across the country, according to a US state department official. The official did not confirm the identities or number of prisoners released by Venezuela, but in a statement called the move \"an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities\". It is the first known release of American citizens since a US military operation seized Nicolás Maduro and his wife during a raid in the capital Caracas on 3 January, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.The UN says Venezuela has so far released about 50 prisoners of what human rights groups estimate are 800 political prisoners detained in the country. The Venezuelan government, led by Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, announced last week it would start releasing \"a significant\" number of people considered political prisoners as a \"goodwill gesture\". Some domestic opposition figures and at least five Spanish citizens are among those confirmed to have been freed so far. Over the weekend, Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that the process of freeing detainees in Venezuela had begun \"in a BIG WAY\". Trump said he cancelled a second wave of airstrikes on Venezuela once he learned Caracas was cooperating with the release of prisoners.The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. However, the interim government has been accused of failing to maintain its promise to release political detainees, including by Ramón Guanipa, whose father is a politician who remains imprisoned. Guanipa told the BBC that Trump should \"not be fooled\" by the gestures of the authorities until all political prisoners are released. Human rights groups and political activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle its critics. Officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, where Maduro claimed victory despite opponents disputing the results.",

    "body": "4 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterThe US government has given chip giant Nvidia the green light to sell its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors in China, the Department of Commerce said on Tuesday.The H200, Nvidia's second-most-advanced semiconductor, had been restricted by Washington over concerns that it would give China's technology industry and military an edge over the US.The Commerce Department said the chips can be shipped to China granted that there is sufficient supply of the processors in the US.President Donald Trump said last month that he would allow the chip sales to \"approved customers\" in China and collect a 25% fee.Nvidia's spokesperson told the BBC that the company welcomed the move, saying it will benefit manufacturing and jobs in the US.The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said its revised export policy applies to Nvidia's H200 chips, as well as less advanced processors. Chinese customers must also show \"sufficient security procedures\" and cannot use the chips for military uses.The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the \"politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues\".\"We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,\" he said. \"This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.\"Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was designed to bolster China's tech industry, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually lobbied Washington to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit  Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.Trump's \"unique\" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.\"It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.\"",

    "body": "Just nowKate Whannel,Political reporterandHenry Zeffman,chief political correspondentGetty ImagesThe government has dropped plans requiring workers to sign up to its digital ID scheme in order to prove their right to work in the UK. By 2029, right to work checks will be done digitally – for example by using biometric passports – but registering with the new digital ID programme will be optional.This marks a shift from last year when the government first announced the policy and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told an audience: \"You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.\"Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said \"Good riddance. It was a terrible policy anyway.\"She said the move by Labour represented \"another U-turn\". The change of policy is the latest in a series of U-turns the government has made since it came to power – including climbdowns on welfare reforms, reducing winter fuel payments and inheritance tax for farmers.When the government first announced the policy plan, it argued that mandatory digital ID for workers would make it easier to clamp down on immigrants working illegally.The scheme, it is understood, will now deal less narrowly with immigration and the government will instead place more emphasis on the argument that digital ID can be a useful tool for the public when accessing public services.Asked about the issue at an Institute for Government conference earlier on Tuesday, Darren Jones, the minister responsible for rolling out the policy, said it would be a \"route to the digital transformation of customer-facing public services\". He said a consultation would be launched \"very shortly\", adding: \"I'm confident this time next year the polling will be in a much better place on digital ID than it is today.\"The policy had attracted criticism since it was announced last September, with nearly three million people signing a parliamentary petition opposing the introduction of digital IDs. There has also been nervousness among some Labour MPs over the compulsory aspect of the original proposal. Whatever they think of the change to this specific policy, Labour MPs are growing increasingly frustrated with the government's u-turns.Some had already been wary of defending controversial government policies to their constituents because they feared that the policy would inevitably be reversed.One furious Labour MP told the BBC last night that the latest U-turn was \"an absolute car crash\", adding: \"The boys at No 10 jumped into it with no thought, marched the PLP up the hill only to bottle it, take all the pain and no credit.\"The Liberal Democrats said the policy was \"doomed to failure\" from the start and called for \"the billions of pounds earmarked for their mandatory digital ID scheme\" to be spent \"on the NHS and frontline policing instead\".The party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Lisa Smart, said: \"No 10 must be bulk ordering motion sickness tablets at this rate to cope with all their U-turns.\"Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said in a post on X: \"This is a victory for individual liberty against a ghastly, authoritarian government. Reform UK would scrap it altogether.\"Green Party leader Zack Polanski welcomed the news on X, saying: \"The government have U-turned on ID cards. Good.\"A government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to mandatory digital right to work checks.\"Currently right to work checks include a hodge podge of paper-based systems with no record of checks ever taking place. This is open to fraud and abuse.\"Digital ID will make everyday life easier for people, ensuring public services are more personal, joined-up, and effective, while also remaining inclusive.\"Employers already have to check if someone they want to hire has the right to work in the UK. Since 2022, employers have been able to do checks on passport-holding British and Irish citizens using digital verification services certified by the government. There is also a Home Office online scheme which verifies the status of some non-British or Irish citizens, whose immigration status is held electronically.The details of how digital ID will work have yet to be set out but it is expected to be based on two government-built systems: Gov.uk One Login and Gov.uk Wallet.Currently more than 12 million people have signed up to One Login, which can be used for services such as applying for a veteran card, cancelling a lost passport or managing a lasting power of attorney. Gov.uk Wallet has not yet been launched but would allow people to store their digital ID on their smartphones.The digital ID would include name, date of birth, nationality and residence status and a photo.

    "body": "6 minutes agoMark Poynting,Climate researcherandJustin Rowlatt,Climate editorThe UK has awarded contracts to build a record amount of offshore wind projects as part of its efforts to grow the country's clean electricity sources.The projects span England, Scotland and Wales, including what could be the world's largest offshore wind farm off the coast of Scotland in the North Sea.But some analysts warn that despite the record haul of offshore wind, the government will still struggle to meet its 2030 \"clean power\" target.The government argues that wind projects are cheaper than new gas power stations and will \"bring down bills for good\", but the Conservatives have previously accused climate targets of raising energy costs.The largest successful project is Berwick Bank in the North Sea, which is the largest planned offshore wind farm worldwide.Other projects to be awarded contracts include the Dogger Bank South wind farm off the coast of Yorkshire and the Norfolk Vanguard project off the coast of East Anglia - while Awel Y Mor was the first successful Welsh project in more than a decade.The government wants at least 95% of Great Britain's electricity to come from \"clean\" sources by 2030, partly to reduce emissions of planet-warming gases from fossil fuels. These clean sources include renewables – such as solar and wind – and nuclear energy.Offshore wind is widely seen as the backbone of Great Britain's future clean electricity system, with plentiful wind resources off the country's coastlines.The government wants at least 43 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030 to help meet its clean power target.That is a big step-up from its current offshore wind capacity, which stands at 16.6GW, with a further 11.7GW under construction, according to the government.Building offshore wind and connecting it to the grid takes time – and many analysts have viewed this auction as crucial to get enough wind to meet its target.The 8.4GW secured at this latest auction just about keeps the offshore wind target in reach, several analysts have told the BBC. But all those projects will still need connecting to the grid to generate electricity.\"Getting that amount of capacity online by 2030 [will be] extremely challenging,\" said Nick Civetta, project leader at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.Like many sectors, the offshore wind industry has been hit by rising costs over the past few years.This is linked to factors like global supply chain pressures, increased steel costs and high interest rates, partly the result of the Russia-Ukraine war.Last year, energy company Orsted decided to \"discontinue\" one of the country's biggest wind projects, Hornsea 4, despite it previously being awarded a contract.In this latest auction, offshore wind projects have been awarded an average fixed price of £91 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, in 2024 prices.While that is down considerably from the first auction in 2015, it is up from the £82/MWh awarded at the last auction for new-build projects in 2024, also in 2024 prices.The government acknowledges the rising cost of offshore wind, but argues that it should be compared with the cost of new gas power plants.Its figures suggest that building and fuelling new gas plants would cost £147/MWh, including a carbon price - a charge for emissions.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"With these results, Britain is taking back control of our energy sovereignty. This is a historic win for those who want Britain to stand on our own two feet, controlling our own energy rather than depending on markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.\"The Conservatives have been asked for comment, but have previously warned that the government risks locking in high offshore wind prices for decades.Reform has also repeatedly attacked the cost of net zero, but the Lib Dems and Greens both support the expansion of renewables to tackle the threat of climate change and boost green jobs.SNP and Plaid Cymru also support the growth of offshore wind, but argue Scotland and Wales should have control of their energy resources.",

    "body": "15 minutes agoJacob PanonsSouth EastGetty ImagesAbout 25,000 people were still being impacted by TuesdaySeveral schools in Sussex and Kent have been forced to close again due to ongoing water supply problems.Issues began on Saturday, with South East Water (SEW) blaming the disruption on the impact of Storm Goretti and a power outage at its pumping station.On Tuesday, the company said about 25,000 customers still had no water or were experiencing intermittent supplies.Ulcombe Church of England Primary in Kent is impacted, as well as East Grinstead schools Sackville School, Imberhorne, Estcots Primary, Ashurst Primary and The Meads Primary.SEW, which has apologised, said on its website on Wednesday morning that there were 12 ongoing interruptions across its network.The BBC has asked the water company how many customers are still affected. The primary school in Ulcombe said online learning would be provided for pupils, and other schools have urged parents to contact them for updates.Several schools in the counties were also closed on Monday and Tuesday because of the lack of water.The Abergavenny Arms pub in Frant says it fears it will \"go bust\" if the water issues continue.\"It's killing us small businesses,\" a spokesperson added.The pub said it had been without water since Sunday morning and had been forced to throw away about £500 worth of food.It said it had been told water would hopefully be restored by Friday.Incident manager Matthew Dean previously said some of the issues were connected to the recent cold weather and a subsequent breakout of leaks and bursts across the area that left drinking water storage tanks running low.Water regulator Ofwat said it was concerned about the supply problems amid calls for it to take action again SEW.Several MPs have also been calling for SEW boss David Hinton, who earns a base salary of £400,000 and was paid a £115,000 bonus in 2025, to step down or to be removed from his role.Five bottled stations were open on Tuesday across East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and Maidstone.On Monday, Kent County Council leader Linden Kemkaran wrote on X that a \"major incident\" had been declared.The Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead also said some appointments may have to be carried out virtually.SEW has been approached for further details.

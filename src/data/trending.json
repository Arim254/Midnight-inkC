    "body": "20 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterThe last 12 months have delivered a huge number of viral moments - Taylor Swift getting engaged, a raccoon getting drunk, and the 6-7 trend driving teachers everywhere to early retirement.But those weren't the only moments that kept us entertained throughout the year. Here are 15 of the cultural highlights (and lowlights) that defined 2025.1. Beyoncé's Grammy reactionCBS\"Wait, what? Me? I've won? I've won a Grammy? I've won this Grammy? Are you sure?\"Beyoncé didn't actually say any of these words as she won country album of the year in February, but her facial expression and body language conveyed her understandable shock.There had been some well-documented snobbery towards Cowboy Carter within the country community, but it had a huge night, also winning Beyoncé album of the year for the first time.We'll skip over the fact that she should've won much sooner for Lemonade or Renaissance and just be grateful that Beyoncé got her trophy and the internet got a meme for the ages.2. Sydney Sweeney's denim dramaGetty Images\"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" So said the strap line for an American Eagle advert in July that featured the Euphoria actress dressed head to toe in denim.Depending on your viewpoint, this was either a fun piece of wordplay in a harmless clothing advert, or a dog whistle for white supremacy and eugenics-era rhetoric.The publicity generated by the fallout duly prompted the company's sales to skyrocket. Sadly for Sweeney, it didn't result in a similar surge for her next film at the box office.The actress herself kept quiet throughout the controversy, but later clarified she \"does not support the views some people chose to connect to the campaign\", adding: \"I did it because I love the jeans and love the brand.\" 3. Lily Allen's revenge Getty Images/Nieves GonzálezIt was an eventful year in music - Oasis got through their reunion shows seemingly without incident, the launch of a new Elvis experience was a blue suede shambles, and Coldplay's tour left two fans in Massachusetts wishing they'd stayed home.Meanwhile, there was an epidemic of plummeting pop stars. A giant car Beyoncé was floating in at her concerts tilted too far, almost tipping her into the audience, while a giant mid-air butterfly Katy Perry was sitting on plunged several feet.But it was Lily Allen's West End Girl that became the most talked about album of the year, thanks to its detailed description of the events that led to her divorce from Stranger Things actor David Harbour.Sample lyric, about setting the terms of an open relationship: \"We had an arrangement / Be discreet and don't be shameless / There had to be payment / It had to be with strangers.\"4. Adolescence: A one-shot wonderNetflix/GettyNetflix's series about a schoolboy accused of stabbing a female classmate was one of the biggest TV hits of the year, dominating conversation for weeks. \"Did you know it was all shot in one take?\" said everybody you know. Gosh, was it really? You're the first person to mention that.\"Can you believe this was Owen Cooper's first screen acting role?\" Well, yes actually.   At 15 years old I wasn't expecting a jam-packed IMDb profile.A few months later, the teenager became the youngest male winner of an Emmy Award, and gave an inspirational acceptance speech.\"I was nothing three years ago, I'm here now,\" said Cooper, who was 12 three years ago. \"If you listen, focus and step out of your comfort zone, you can achieve anything in life.\"5. Dubai chocolate floods the shelvesGetty ImagesThere have been plenty of food and drink crazes over the years - matcha, bubble tea, cronuts, and the Starbucks olive oil coffee that we're still disappointed didn't really catch on. This year, the pistachio finally got its moment in the spotlight, after a woman with a very specific pregnancy craving turned it into a phenomenon.The decadent chocolate bar and its creamy pistachio filling subsequently went viral on TikTok thanks to its photogenic look and velvety taste, leading to a string of imitators (charging £11 per bar) and a global surge in pistachio demand.6. The endlessly parodied Jet2 advertGetty ImagesDespite being released in 2015, Jess Glynne's Hold My Hand was named TikTok song of the year after a viral trendOne of the most enjoyable trends of the summer, before it inevitably became overdone, was the much-parodied Jet2 advert.You know the one, where the inescapable Jess Glynne song Hold My Hand plays over footage of a family enjoying their holiday, in an ad campaign that has been running since around 1874. Social media users began sending it up by using the music and slogan over scenes of travel chaos instead, such as tourists in hotels binge-drinking, getting sunburn and physically fighting over sun loungers.Other TikTokkers took to the streets to test members of the public on the ad's famous strap line. The trend led to Hold My Hand being named TikTok's song of the year, despite being released in 2015.7. EsDeeKid's video with Timothée ChalametChalamet/EsDeeKid/XAs Banksy will tell you, nothing gets the public (and press) more interested in your work than keeping your identity a secret. There was much speculation, therefore, over EsDeeKid - a Liverpool rapper who shot to fame this year but keeps his face hidden under a balaclava, bandana or mask.Some fans suggested the rapper's eyes - the only visible part of his face - bore a striking resemblance to those of Hollywood A-lister Timothée Chalamet, who played along with the mystique when asked about it in interviews.On his next visit to London, Chalamet broke off from the red carpets and chat show sofas to meet the drill star, and the pair collaborated in a music video filmed outside a Finsbury Park off-licence.8. Labubu mania prompts consumer chaosGetty ImagesIf 2025 had a face, it was undoubtedly made of vinyl, with pointy ears, big eyes and a grin with precisely nine teeth.Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung and adapted from picture book series The Monsters, the slightly scary-looking Labubu could be seen hanging from everybody's bag this year, with Rihanna, Dua Lipa and Lisa from Blackpink joining in.It's lucky that British people love a queue, as the plush toys prompted long lines around the world. The character's loveable but demonic appearance is said to be matched by its kind-hearted but chaotic personality (same, tbh).9. David Tennant's bonkers Bafta songCamila Cabello was fully on board with David Tennant's Proclaimers tributeHost David Tennant opened this year's Baftas with a barnstorming rendition of I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) by the Proclaimers - which involved some participation from the A-list crowd.Tennant name-checked Selena Gomez and Hugh Grant as he walked through the audience, but frankly those guys got off lightly compared with what came next.The actor picked on Camila Cabello, Anna Kendrick, Colman Domingo, James McAvoy and Celia Imrie for the call-and-response \"Da da-da!\" bits after the chorus.The facial expressions throughout were priceless. Some were enthusiastically on board, others seemed utterly confused and Jeff Goldblum looked as if he was having the best night of his life. 10. Rachel Zegler's film flop (and theatre triumph)Disney/PA MediaRachel Zegler in Snow White (left) and singing from the London Palladium balcony in EvitaA live action remake of Snow White ran into several controversies ahead of its release in March.Actress Rachel Zegler ruffled a few feathers by criticising the classic original, there were reports of tension between her and co-star Gal Gadot over the conflict in Gaza, and Disney got itself into a right old tangle over what to do about the seven dwarfs. The film bombed. But Zegler took Pitbull's advice and turned a negative into a positive, appearing in a successful West End production of Evita a few months later. A clever stunt which saw her leave the London Palladium stage to perform Don't Cry For Me Argentina from its balcony attracted giant crowds outside. An estimated 130,000 people watched Zegler from the street over the show's run.11. Streaming hits (and misses)Disney/Amazon/HBOL-R: Kim Kardashian in All's Fair, Joe Wilkinson in Last One Laughing, and Aimee Lou Wood in The White LotusAmazon found themselves with a surprise hit on their hands thanks to the first series of Last One Laughing, a reality show about 10 comedians in a house who aren't allowed to laugh at each other.The most viral moment came when Joe Wilkinson was giving a mock-serious speech about the RNLI, only to be pelted with a giant ball of pink paint, for no apparent reason. Glorious.Meanwhile, the third season of wealth satire The White Lotus became one of the most talked about series of the year, and prompted a row over a Saturday Night Live parody that had mocked Aimee Lou Wood's teeth.Kim Kardashian's legal series All's Fair, however, was far less well received with some critics suggesting it \"may be the worst TV drama ever\". But Kardashian made light of the bad reviews by using them to promote the series, which was promptly recommissioned.12. Alan Carr turning into a cold-blooded killer The biggest TV show of the year however, was a triumphant first series of The Celebrity Traitors, and the many viral moments that came with it.Tom Daley's side-eye, Celie Imrie's noisy digestive system, Paloma Faith's early murder, Kate Garraway's theatrics, Joe Marler's \"big dog\" theory and Jonathan Ross's rousing exit speech all contributed to a memorable series.But Alan Carr was the breakout star. We almost feel bad about how much he struggled with being a traitor, but his sweating and discomfort were pure entertainment. Plus, he pulled off an astonishing last-minute win.It led to a career resurgence for Carr, which he was both delighted and miffed about. \"People are going 'Oh, that Alan, isn't he funny?'\" he told Graham Norton. \"I've been on telly for 25 years, I must have been awful!\"13. Adrien Brody's never-ending Oscars speechGetty ImagesBreaking an Oscars record is usually a good thing, but Adrien Brody achieved a dubious honour when he won best actor in February.Accepting the statue for his role in The Brutalist, Brody threw his chewing gum at his girlfriend before delivering an acceptance speech which lasted 5min 40sec - the longest in Academy history. The orchestra tried to play him off, but he waved them off and continued his self-indulgence undeterred. Rumour has it he's still on stage at the Dolby Theatre today.A few weeks later, when presenter Conan O'Brien was confirmed to return in 2026, he joked: \"The only reason I'm hosting the Oscars next year is that I want to hear Adrien Brody finish his speech.\"14. The celeb-packed Blue Origin space flightEPAKaty Perry and Gayle King were among six women who took an 11-minute flight to space as part of the Blue Origin voyage in April. They flew more than 100km above earth, giving them a few minutes of weightlessness to enjoy Perry's live rendition of What a Wonderful World. But some commentators said it was \"tone deaf\" for celebrities to be taking part in such a fleeting and expensive trip at a time of economic struggle.And there was one fellow singer who made clear she wouldn't be following Perry into orbit...15. Mariah: 'I think I've done enough''Wow': Mariah Carey discovers Katy Perry went into spaceWe'd been aware for a while that Mariah Carey likes to take life at an easy pace these days, as she demonstrated in a less-than-energetic performance at the VMAs in September. But in case there was any doubt, she clarified her feelings about space travel in an interview with BBC Radio 2. The iconic behaviour began when presenter Scott Mills asked her about Perry's trip, and it emerged that the news story hadn't even made it on to Carey's radar (\"Did she go to space?\")Mills followed up by asking whether she would ever flying into orbit herself. In a response that went viral and gave us our new motto for 2026, Carey said simply: \"I think I've done enough.\"",

    "body": "Few things mark the winter season a much as frosty mornings, a sprinkling of snow and the robin, which comes into its own when the weather turns cold. It is one of the UK's most-loved garden birds and along with species like wrens can still be heard singing, external long after some other species go quiet. While other birds focus on looking for food and staying warm in the winter the wren and robin's determination to defend their territory means that they sing all year round warning to others to stay away. Blackbirds and thrushes can also be heard regardless of the chill in the air.Many birds fly south to warmer climates in the winter and some fly in to the UK looking for winter food, external. But those that remain spend their time competing for the scarce resources and trying to survive in the lower temperatures. The robin's song changes with the seasons. In the winter it is softer and less dynamic. But in the spring and summer its song is more lively and intense.This coincides with when it starts looking for a mate which is the reason why most other birds start singing again. The dawn chorus can be heard from late January, with more and more birds joining in, external as the weather gets warmer.The best time to hear it is around 30 minutes before and after sunrise, when birds are most active.Blackbirds and robins are usually the first to sing, external, followed by wrens, thrushes, and warblers as the light increases.You can find the sunrise and sunset times for where you live on the BBC Weather website or app.Still, dry mornings are the best to hear the chorus in all its glory. On a calm, still morning their song will travel further.  Even during a quiet, steady drizzle, most species will sing much as usual.However, Daniel Johnson, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: \"Birds tend to avoid singing in bad weather conditions. This includes windy, rainy or cloudy conditions as during these times they're usually low down conserving energy.\"So if you notice the birds have fallen silent, it can indicate that bad weather is on the way. Conversely a study carried out by researchers in the USA showed that exposure to high temperatures can also reduce song production, external.For most species once they've mated and their fledglings have left they sing less and focus on surviving the cold months. Scientists believe that the sound of birds singing makes humans feel safe. The soaring melodies are a reassuring sign that all is well in the environment meaning the absence of birdsong can feel unsettling - even if we don't consciously realise why.",

    "body": "The Treasury is set to insure the Bayeux Tapestry against damage for an estimated £800m while it is on loan to the British Museum next year.The 70m-long embroidery depicting the Battle of Hastings in 1066 will travel from France to London as part of a deal between the two nations' governments.The artefact's transit and its time in storage and on display will be covered under the Government Indemnity Scheme (GIS). Indemnity insurance covers situations like loss or damage.A Treasury spokesperson said that, without the long-standing scheme, \"public museums and galleries would face a substantial commercial insurance premium, which would be significantly less cost effective\".There are concerns about the move, as some French art experts have suggested the nearly 1,000-year-old work was in far too a delicate state to be transported - something French officials have denied.It is understood the Treasury has received an initial valuation for covering the Bayeux Tapestry that has been provisionally approved. The loan will not be formally confirmed until it receives the final valuation.That final valuation is estimated to be around £800m, according to the Financial Times, citing unnamed officials. The Treasury did not dispute this figure when approached by the BBC.The Bayeux Tapestry will be displayed in the Sainsbury Exhibitions Gallery of the British Museum from next September until July 2027 while its current home, the Bayeux Museum, undergoes renovations. Comprising 58 scenes, 626 characters and 202 horses, the huge masterpiece charts a contested time in Anglo-French relations when William The Conqueror took the English throne from Harold Godwinson, becoming the first Norman king of England.The government's indemnity scheme allows art and cultural objects to be shown publicly in the UK which \"might not have been otherwise because the cost of insurance would have been too high\".  The scheme - first set up in 1980 - has facilitated numerous high-value loans,  including Vincent van Gogh's 1888 work The Bedroom to the National Gallery. The scheme is estimated to save museums and galleries around £81m a year when compared to the cost of taking out commercial insurance.In exchange for the Bayeux Tapestry, the British Museum will loan items to France, including the 7th Century Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered at the Sutton Hoo burial site in Suffolk and the 12th Century Lewis chess pieces.",

    "body": "8 hours agoBBCThe remains were incorrectly labelled in the morgue at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital Scotland's largest hospital has apologised after a bereaved family was given the wrong body for a cremation ceremony.Morgue staff at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow passed an incorrectly labelled corpse to undertakers. The mistake was only realised after the funeral service and cremation.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde blamed human error and said that the staff involved had been suspended.First reported by the Scottish Sun, the family who thought they were cremating their loved one are said to be inconsolable.The mistake also denied another family the chance to have their relative's remains for a funeral. Dr Scott Davidson, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde medical director, said: \"I would like to offer my sincere apologies to both families affected.\"We have very rigorous processes for the identification and labelling of bodies from arrival in our mortuaries until their release into the care of an undertaker.\"It is of deep regret that these processes have not been adhered to on this occasion, and that as a result two families have been caused significant additional distress at an already very difficult time.\"We launched an immediate investigation into this incident and will ensure that learning is applied.\"'Deeply concerned'The £840m QEUH campus, which includes the Royal Hospital for Children, was hailed as a world leading facility when it opened in 2015.However, it has been dogged by infection outbreaks and concerns around the water and ventilation systems.Such issues are being investigated as part of the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry.The Scottish government said it was \"deeply concerned\" by the cremation incident.A spokesperson said: \"We wish to express our sincere condolences to the families involved with this terrible incident. \"We have been clear with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde that they must fully investigate the circumstances. \"We will also carefully consider the findings of the senior inspector of burial, cremation and funeral directors into the circumstances.\"",

    "body": "6 hours agoJonathan Head,South East Asia correspondentandTabby WilsonA ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia has come into effect along the border, where almost three weeks of deadly clashes have forced nearly one million people from their homes.In a joint statement, the defence ministers of the two countries agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now, ban reinforcements and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible.The ceasefire took effect at noon local time (05:00 GMT) on Saturday. Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he hopes the ceasefire will \"pave the way\" for peace, while an EU spokesperson urged \"good faith\" in its implementation.Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.That ceasefire agreement collapsed earlier this month, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia.The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".",

    "body": "2 hours agoJoshua AskewSouth EastGetty ImagesContactless changes were expanded to 30 more train stations in DecemberThe expansion of contactless payments on trains has caused the price of travelling on some services to soar as they now require more expensive peak time tickets.The change allows people to pay by tapping a bank card or contactless-enabled device on readers at stations, avoiding the need to manually purchase a ticket.But Rebecca Paul, Conservative MP for Reigate, said the new rules  -  introduced to 30 more stations in the South East on 14 December - risked \"pricing passengers out of rail altogether\".Train operator Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said the changes meant many passengers would save money and insisted the process was not designed to increase revenue. The introduction of contactless payments to 30 more stations in south-east England forms part of the Department for Transport's (DfT) Project Oval.However, changes to paper ticketing time restrictions to align with Transport for London's contactless structure have meant some services that could previously be used with an off-peak ticket now require a more expensive peak ticket.'Ridiculous'The first weekday London-bound Southern service from Reigate, Surrey, that can be boarded with an off-peak day travelcard ticket now departs at 09:28, compared with 08:58 previously.But when the 08:58 train calls at Redhill just five minutes later, passengers are still able to board it with an off-peak ticket.A day travelcard that can be used at any time from the stations costs £37.10 whereas an off-peak is £20.60.There are also new restrictions on travel between 16:00 and 19:00.One member of the Reigate, Redhill and District Rail Users' Association described the situation as \"ridiculous\" and said he would cycle to Redhill to save money.Getty ImagesThe Department for Transport has defended the changesMeanwhile, Paul said a number of residents were \"understandably frustrated\" by the contactless expansion. The MP added: \"This change should make rail travel easier, not more expensive or confusing.\"The contactless rollout has also led to the cheapest super off-peak tickets being removed from some stations.Analysis by lobby group Railfuture said passengers paying by contactless would be charged up to twice as much as those using paper tickets for some journeys.This is because discounts for railcards or children cannot be registered with contactless.'More flexible travel'A GTR spokesman said: \"Peak and off-peak timing has to match with the TfL system...\"We understand how, for some people, this means fares will rise, but for many others they will fall.\"It pointed to a number of savings, such as Reigate passengers making a single journey at weekday off-peak times now paying £7.60 compared with £14.60 previously.Commuters travelling before 06:30 and returning either before 16:00 or after 19:00 now save £11.60, it added. The Department for Transport said: \"Contactless ticketing means passengers are benefiting from simpler, more flexible travel and the majority of single tickets will be the same price or even lower.\"More on this storyRelated internet links",

    "body": "Italian police have arrested nine people accused of raising around €7m (£6m) for Hamas over more than two years.The money was ostensibly collected as humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians, a police statement said, but was instead sent to the militant group via a \"complex fundraising system\".Alongside the arrests, police say they have seized more than €8m (£7m) in assets as part of the investigation. Police say the suspects are \"specifically accused of carrying out financing operations believed to have contributed to terrorist activities\".The arrests were made as part of a joint initiative between Italy's counter-terror police and financial police.The investigation began after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack in southern Israel. Police say they analysed \"a series of reports of suspicious financial transactions\" involving some of the suspects in the lead up to the attack.Investigators uncovered a \"complex\" system of fundraising, which was headquartered in Genoa with branches in Milan, the statement adds.\"The suspects collected donations intended for the civilian population of Gaza, however, it emerged that over 71% of these funds were diverted to Hamas's coffers to finance its military wing and support the families of suicide bombers or those detained for terrorism,\" the police statement says.Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the most well-known of the arrested suspects was Mohammad Hannoun, the president of the Palestinian Association in Italy.Mr Hannoun has previously described allegations he is a financier of Hamas as a \"lie\". Piantedosi thanked police for their work in a post on X, but also noted that \"the presumption of innocence... must always be recognised at this stage\".",

    "body": "The head of the Kennedy Center in Washington DC has demanded $1m (£740,000) in damages from a musician who cancelled a concert after President Donald Trump's name was added to the venue.Chuck Redd called off his Christmas Eve performance, which he has hosted annually since 2006, citing a vote by the board to rename the site the Trump Kennedy Center.In his letter, Richard Grenell, said the cancellation was a \"political stunt\" and \"has cost us considerably\". Redd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Shortly after taking office, Trump fired several of the board members, and replaced them with allies, who then voted to make Trump chairman of the board. Grenell, the Trump Kennedy Center president, wrote in his letter to Redd that his no-show \"is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution\".He added: \"Your dismal ticket sales and lack of donor support, combined with your last-minute cancellation has cost us considerably. \"This is your official notice that we will seek $1 million in damages from you for this political stunt.\"Last week, the White House announced the centre's board had voted unanimously to rename the cultural institution as The Donald J Trump and John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.A day later, crews could be seen etching the president's name on the building's façade. Its website and some social media accounts were also renamed.The White House said the renaming effort was in recognition of Trump's actions to renovate the building, but the move was criticised by Democrats, several artists and members of the Kennedy family. \"When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,\" Redd, a drummer and vibraphone player, told the Associated Press news agency earlier this week.Congresswoman Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, recently filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Trump's name from the centre.She argued in her lawsuit that because the centre was named in a 1964 law, changing its name should require \"an act of Congress\".The lawsuit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change, but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. She is one of several lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. Work on a national performing arts centre began in the 1950s and after Kennedy, the 35th president, was assassinated in 1963, Congress decided to turn it into a living memorial to him.",

    "body": "Liverpool and Wolves paid tribute to Diogo Jota on an emotional day at Anfield as his two former sides met for the first time since his death.The Portugal forward, 28, was killed in a car crash in Spain in July, alongside his 25-year-old brother Andre Silva.Jota joined Liverpool in 2020 after three seasons with Wolves.Dinis and Duarte, two of his three children, joined the matchday mascots on the pitch before their Premier League game on Saturday.Jota's sons, along with other young family members, led the Liverpool team out of the tunnel, walking out ahead of captain Virgil van Dijk.Jota's wife, Rute Cardoso, was also in attendance.A banner which read 'Diogo Jota, forever in our hearts' was held aloft in the Kop stand before kick-off.Chants of \"Diogo, Diogo, Diogo\" rang out from the Wolves fans in the away end before all of Anfield stood and applauded as Liverpool supporters sang in tribute to Jota in the 20th minute.Dutch midfielder Ryan Gravenberch scored Liverpool's opener and dedicated it to Jota - recreating the shark-style celebration that the Portugal forward sometimes used.On Friday, Wolves players and staff laid wreaths outside Anfield in memory of their former forward, who joined the club on an initial season-long loan deal from Atletico Madrid in 2017 and went on to score 44 goals in 131 appearances.Jota scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for Liverpool, helping them win the FA Cup and EFL Cup in 2022 and the Premier League title last season.The Merseyside club retired Jota's number 20 shirt following his death.In his programme notes before Liverpool's final home fixture of 2025, head coach Arne Slot said he hopes the affection Jota is held in can bring his family \"solace\".\"Reflecting on everything that has happened over the last 12 months ignites a rollercoaster of emotions but it is normal at this time of year to look back to everything that has happened,\" said Slot.\"Doing so leads me to think especially of the family of Diogo Jota on what will be their first Christmas without him.\"It is not my place to tell them where they should look for comfort – if that is even possible – but I can only hope that the feeling of love and affection that Diogo still generates brings them some solace.\"",

    "body": "18 hours agoIain WatsonPolitical correspondentThe leader of the Trades Union Congress has called for \"the closest possible economic and political relationship with the European Union\".The UK's most senior trade unionist, Paul Nowak, told the BBC that he believed this would be \"essential\" to boost economic growth and warned that faith in mainstream politics could \"drain away\" unless living standards improved.Nowak urged the PM not to rule out a customs union with the EU, which he argued would lower barriers to trade with the UK's biggest market.Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to \"reset\" relations with Brussels but has ruled out rejoining the EU's single market and customs union.The prime minister fears that recent deals with the US and India would be scrapped if the UK rejoined.Labour's manifesto ruled out signing up to the existing EU custom union.Recently, senior cabinet ministers such as Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy have danced along the edges of those red lines, bemoaning what they see as the economic damage of Brexit and extolling the virtues of closer relations. Earlier this month, 13 Labour MPs backed a Liberal Democrat bill requiring the government to begin negotiations on joining a bespoke customs union with the EU.The Conservatives and Reform UK oppose rejoining a customs union, and say it would undermine what they see as the benefits of Brexit.A customs union would eliminate tariffs or taxes on goods between the UK and the EU, reducing bureaucracy. But critics point out that it would also severely curtail the UK's ability to strike bespoke global trade deals, as the EU would place a common tariff on all goods from outside the customs union area and would expect the UK to conform to common standards.Nowak told the BBC in an interview: \"2026 really needs to be the year when the government gets to grips with the cost of living crisis.\"He said that \"one of the reasons we are seeing prices so high in our supermarkets is because of that bad Brexit deal\", adding: \"Absolutely the government should rule nothing out. They should look at every option for our relationship with the European Union up to and including a customs union.\"I go round workplaces week in, week out - aerospace, automative, steel - and having a good deal with Europe is essential.\"Nowak, who became general secretary of the TUC in 2023, also said the government must act on a wide range of fronts to make people feel better off, or risk paying a political price.He pointed to research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation that suggested that voters who felt financially insecure were abandoning Labour at a greater rate than those who felt more secure. The TUC itself commissioned polling suggesting one in five people were skipping some meals, and one in three expected their financial situation to worsen.Nowak praised action the government had already announced to help some families, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, but said the government should do more.As TUC leader, Nowak represents 47 trade unions with a collective membership of more than five million people. He has the ear of government and this is the message he is shouting into it: that there should be no backsliding on implementing the newly enacted Employment Rights Act.The legislation will give workers access to sick pay and paternity leave from the first day on the job and contains new protections for pregnant women and new mothers. But many of its measures will not be implemented immediately and, in November, Labour backed down from its plan to give all workers the right to claim unfair dismissal from their first day in a job. Instead, it will be after a six-month period. The Conservatives say the act will place new burdens on businesses and destroy jobs.Nowak also called for no cap to be placed on penalties big employers would face if they tried to prevent unions from organising in their workplaces, and insisted the new rights would boost living standards by \"making work pay\" and by making employment more secure.A government spokesperson said it knew there was \"more to do to help families with the cost of living\", pointing to Budget measures to cut energy bills, freeze rail fares and prescription fees, and raise the living wage, among others.\"With the passing of the Employment Rights Act, we will transform workers' rights for the 21st Century with a clear commitment to implement this in full and on time,\" they added.Labour is trailing Reform UK in the polls, but Nowak said the solution was not to \"get on the same pitch\" on immigration.\"I don't think you can out-Reform Reform,\" he said. \"For too many people at the economic sharp end in low paid employment, they feel that change hasn't come, or come quickly enough. \"But for lots of people it looks like there is a simple answer in Reform.  \"My job isn't to tell union members they have voted the wrong way. The responsibility is on the government to demonstrate that mainstream politics can deliver the change people want.\"But it would seem discontented voters are not just drifting to Reform. The left candidate Andrea Egan was elected this month as the leader of the country's biggest union Unison, and she is calling for a change of direction from the government and a change of Labour leader.Supporters of the incumbent, Christina McAnea, felt that her perceived closeness to the Labour leadership had harmed her chances.Nowak said: \"You only have to look at the opinion polls - the prime minister is struggling personally too. \"If the government can deliver on improving living standards, then I think the polls will look after themselves. A Labour government is always at its best when it is ambitious and on the front foot.\"",

    "body": "55 minutes agoRachel Muller-HeyndykandAdam GoldsmithThe sound of gunfire and blasts can be heard overnight and into the morning in KyivAn intense Russian attack on Kyiv overnight shows Moscow \"doesn't want peace\", Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday as he prepared for a fresh round of peace talks. Zelensky made the comments en route to Florida, where he will meet US President Donald Trump on Sunday to discuss a new 20-point peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys.The 10-hour missile and drone barrage directed at Ukraine's capital killed two people and left 32 injured, local authorities said.Damage to energy infrastructure left 40 percent of residential buildings in Kyiv and nearby districts without heating, according to Ukraine's minister for development Oleksiy Kuleba.Russia's ministry of defence said long-range precision weapons were used to target energy facilities, which it claimed were being used \"in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and enterprises of the Ukrainian military-industrial complex\".Writing on Telegram Zelensky said that Russia directed almost 500 drones and 40 missiles towards Kyiv, targeting energy and civilian infrastructure.Pictures showed gaping holes in apartment buildings and homes on fire following the strikes.The apartment block of BBC journalist Anastasiya Gribanova was struck, leaving some homes on the higher levels of the high-rise building in flames. Gribanova, who was in the building's elevator at the time, was unharmed.ReutersA house in Kyiv was also hit, Ukraine's emergency services saidUkraine's State Emergency Service said that 68 people were evacuated from a retirement home in the eastern Darnytskyi district.\"Russian representatives are having long conversations, but in reality the Daggers [missiles] and Shaheds [drones] are speaking for them,\" Zelensky wrote on Telegram, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin does not want to end the war.\"This sick activity can only be responded to with really strong steps. America has this opportunity, Europe has this opportunity, many of our partners have this opportunity,\" he wrote, urging allies to show strength against Russian aggression.The attack saw Poland, which shares a 530km-long (320 miles) border with western Ukraine, ready its fighter jets, ground-based air defence systems and radar reconnaissance.Later on Saturday morning, it concluded that there had been no violation of the country's airspace.Russia's Defence Ministry said its air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed almost 200 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions, including eight over Moscow.Zelensky briefly met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday, ahead of his Florida meeting with Trump.Speaking in Nova Scotia, Zelensky said the latest bombardment of Kyiv was \"Russia's answer [to] our peace efforts and this really shows that Putin doesn't want peace\".Carney pledged $2.5 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine, but agreed that \"lasting peace\" would require \"a willing Russia\". Zelensky said he hoped for a \"constructive\" meeting with Trump on Sunday to discuss the 20-point plan.Security guarantees and territorial concessions for Ukraine are likely to return to the table, issue on which Russia has previously been unwilling to compromise.Also on Saturday, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited a command and control overseeing Moscow's war, according to Russian news agency TASS. Wearing army fatigues, Putin said if Kyiv did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully, Russia would accomplish its objectives militarily, according to comments in state media. ReutersThe aftermath of the damage in KyivThe new 20-point draft is a revised version of an earlier 28-point plan which was drafted by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, but widely seen as being too favourable to Russia.The Ukrainian president has voiced optimism around the new draft, describing it as \"a foundational document on ending the war\", but Trump warned that Zelensky \"doesn't have anything until I approve it\" in an interview with Politico.The draft reportedly includes security guarantees from the US, Nato and European allies for a co-ordinated military response if Russia were to invade Ukraine again.Control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas has been a sticking point in talks so far, but now Zelensky has said a \"free economic zone\" could be an option. Trump told Politico that he was expecting to see the new draft on Sunday.\"I think it's going to go good with him. I think it's going to go good with [Vladimir] Putin,\" Trump said in the interview, adding that he expects to speak with Russia's president \"soon\". ",

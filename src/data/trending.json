This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

The debris, usually bits of rock or ice, hits the Earth's atmosphere and burns up because of the friction, sending light streaks across the night sky. </p><p>The point in the sky from which the meteors appear to originate is known as the radiant and the quality of the display is measured by how many meteors are visible every hour - known as the zenithal hourly rate. That rate varies year by year. </p><p>The Draconids have not been particularly active in recent years - the best displays occurred in 1933 and 1946.</p><p>The meteors come from the debris of Comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner, with the radiant in the constellation of Draco - hence the name. </p></div><div><figure><p><span><picture><source srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg.webp 976w\" type=\"image/webp\"></source><img alt=\"A Draconid meteor sends a bright green streak in the night sky\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1280/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/240/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/320/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/624/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 624w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/800/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/bd43/live/61e4abe0-a351-11f0-928c-71dbb8619e94.jpg 976w\" /></picture></span><span><span>Image source, </span>PA Media/ Owen Humphreys</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Draconids are sometimes known as the Giacobinids, named after Michel Giacobini who discovered the comet from which the meteors come</p></figcaption></figure></div><p></p><h2 id=\"How-visible-will-it-be-this-year\"><span>How visible will it be this year?</span></h2><p></p><div><p>In 2025, the meteor shower coincides with the full <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c059dyvvjj7o\">Harvest Moon</a> which rose on the night of the 7 October.

Because I have to go out for a meeting,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US. </p><p>The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000).</p><p>The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it \"molecular architecture\".</p><p>The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. </p><p>These \"rooms\" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.</p><p>The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds.</p><p>So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced.</p><p>One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. </p><p>Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories.</p><p>Professor Robson, who was born in North Yorkshire but has been based at the University of Melbourne since 1966, told BBC Newshour that the news \"wasn't a big surprise [because of] all sorts of sounds I've been hearing over the years\".</p><p>When asked about the potential applications of his work he urged caution:  \"There's talk about binding CO2 and solving the world's atmospheric problems, which don't sound realistic to me - but these sorts of compounds could do that sort of job on a small scale\".</p><p>The 88-year-old professor admits the prize money \"is the main thing actually in my head. It wasn't the driving force for all of this but at this stage in my life that's a very nice thought to have\".</p><p>The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems.</p><p>\"Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,\" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain.</p></div><div><p>The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of \"the usefulness of useless\", according to the Nobel committee. It reflected the philosophy of an ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who said that even if something did not bring immediate benefit, it could still turn out to be valuable.</p><p>Professor Yaghi was born in Amman, Jordan and raised in a single room with his siblings without electricity or running water, according to the Nobel committee.</p><p>He became captivated by molecular structures one day at school, and aged 15, he went to the US to study.</p><p>It is the third science prize awarded this week. On Tuesday John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Physics Nobel for their work on quantum mechanics that paved the way for the quantum computer.</p><p>On Monday three scientists' work on how the immune system attacks hostile infections won them the prize for medicine.</p></div>",

It's now even later.</p><p>\"The Conservatives are basically only being kept afloat in the polls at the moment by the over 75 age category. Obviously, for demographic reasons, that is not a sustainable place to be.\"</p><p>At another event, pollster James Johnson of JL Partners began his presentation on the attitudes of voters under 40 with the ominous words: \"Conservative Party members turn away now.\"</p><p>One Young Conservative sought to offer some good news by telling the event that at Keele University the Conservative Society now had the biggest membership in a decade.</p><p>He paused to allow for some impressed noises from the audience before adding: \"We now have 11 members.\"</p><p>With 16-year-olds <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2lgnze013o\">likely to get the vote</a> at the next election, the problem could become yet more acute. </p><p>\"The party has been a bit lazy on this,\" says shadow housing minister Paul Holmes. </p><p>\"We need to pull our finger out of our bums.\"</p><p>But what - if anything - can Conservatives do to fix the problem?</p></div><p></p><h2>Beware the Millennial Pause</h2><p></p><div><p>\"We need to be where the voters are,\" says Luke Evans a Conservative MP, shadow minister and keen Tik-Toker.</p><p>He says his colleagues should be embracing the social media platform more but warns colleagues to avoid the \"Millennial Pause\" - the two-second gap the older generation leave at the beginning of videos before starting to talk.</p><p>\"That's the biggest turn off,\" he says.</p><p>At another event, one audience member said the party needed to copy the approach of American right-wing online influencers.</p><p>They suggested that the Conservatives should run a campaign encouraging young people to send in stories of left-wing behaviour that they argue could be mocked online - for example, a teacher calling Winston Churchill a fascist or a classmate identifying as a cat.</p><p>Blake Stephenson, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, agrees that Conservatives had to \"communicate in a way they want to consume the information\".</p><p>\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where anything beyond 10 or 15 seconds is just sort of too much for people and they just scroll up.</p><p>\"At this conference we're talking about very complicated policy areas... and we're saying quite rightly that the solutions are not easy. </p><p>\"If anyone tells you that the solutions to any of these complicated problems are easy, then they are sort of sending you up the river. </p><p>\"But yet we need to project complicated responses and answers to complicated questions in 20 seconds.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>'A stake in society'</h2><p></p><div><p>Former minister and former Conservative leadership contender Tom Tugendhat says young people were not \"drifting away from the centre\" but \"drifting away from what doesn't work for them\".</p><p>Young people were \"realising the entire economy is now geared towards a bunch of people who are aging,\" he says.</p><p>\"They are not stupid - they are choosing parties that are revolutionary.\"</p><p>Fred Lynam from the Young Conservatives says the party has a \"difficult hill to climb – even more difficult with young voters\".</p><p>\"The way it will happen is by giving young people a stake in society – then they will feel like they have got something to conserve. </p><p>\"That is why they are flocking to Your Party, the Greens and Reform because they are arguing that we need to tear it down, because it is not working.\"</p><p>Several panellists at conference events say that offering policies that made it easier for young people to buy a home would help. </p><p>Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has announced that the Conservatives would give young people <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gzv9j78dyo\">a £5,000 tax rebate</a> in their first job, in a bid to help them buy their first home; and in her keynote speech, Kemi Badenoch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cly79lr1yxyt?post=asset%3A4f6fa7f3-db63-4c0f-a757-57975cc25752#post\">promised a Conservative government would scrap stamp duty on homes.</a></p></div><div><p>At the beginning of conference, Badenoch said Conservatives needed to \"face up\" to what they got wrong, pointing to the rise in small boats crossings and - without mentioning her by name - Liz Truss's mini budget as examples.</p><p>But some at conference have argued that too much hand-wringing could blur the Conservatives message to young people.</p><p>\"By the next election there will be voters who haven't experienced a Conservative government in their adult life so that need for contrition is probably less,\" says Lynam. </p><p>Blake Stephenson says that during the 2024 election campaign he had experienced a lot of anger from voters and that \"humility is important\".</p><p>\"How long will the blood letting take. I don't know. I hope fairly quickly.\"</p></div><div><p>\"The facts of life are Conservative\" is a quote from former PM Margaret Thatcher which has been trotted out at fringe events.</p><p>It reflects a sense among some at conference that voters in the younger demographic will inevitably turn to the Conservatives, because their arguments will be proved right in time - particularly if, as some delegates predict, there will be an economic crisis in the next few years. </p><p>Rebecca Paul says young people have \"bad associations\" with the last Conservative government which \"tried to keep everyone happy and ended up with a mishmash of policies\".</p><p>She says Badenoch wouldn't make the same mistakes. \"She is honest. She will tell you things you don't want to hear.</p><p>\"We need to come up with sensible policies. People will in time start listening to us. </p><p>\"Tough gig but we're going to be back.\"</p><p>Julian Ellacott, chair of the Conservative's National Convention, told one fringe event the research suggested it would take two years before voters of all ages started listening to the Conservatives again. </p><p>\"The answer is - who knows. We have to stick to our job, focus on our own game.</p><p>\"It will take as long as it takes but we mustn't be like magpies and get distracted by shiny things.</p><p>\"We need to get the core things right.\"</p></div><p></p><figcaption>Watch: Young Conservative members asked if they would ever join Reform UK</figcaption><p></p></article>",

    "body": "Having made the journey from Blacko in Lancashire to the bright lights of Brisbane, England's Herbie Farnworth has emerged as an NRL star in Australia.As arguably the best centre in the world, he is also the \"cheat code\" England hope can help deliver a first Ashes series victory over the Kangaroos since 1970.Farnworth is one of six men in Shaun Wane's England squad who play in Australia's premier competition.And his abilities cannot be underestimated, even as former Australia forward Aaron Woods and other pundits from outside the UK have provided fuel for Wane's squad with withering comments about their quality.A key member of the side who reached the World Cup semi-final in 2022, Farnworth was named as one of the two Dally M centres of the year in both 2023 and 2024 and was instrumental in England's 2-0 win over Samoa 12 months ago - scoring three tries and emerging as the series' top metre maker.During 2025, Farnworth exhibited his class for the Dolphins, as he crossed for 12 tries in 19 appearances until a hamstring injury ended his season in early August and affected the Queensland side's push for the finals.Wane has repeatedly referred to him as \"one of the best centres in the world\", a view endorsed by England captain George Williams, who looks set to be a club-mate of Farnworth's in the near future.\"Herbie is unbelievable,\" said the England stand-off. \"He is one of the best players in the world at the minute. He is a cheat code playing in the NRL so we welcome him into our team with open arms.\"He creates something from nothing. He's a good lad too, who I have known for a long time. He kills it in the NRL.\"In the last series we played against Samoa, it was like he was playing a different game to anyone else. He was just running through like he was playing under-sevens.\"Gold Coast Titans back AJ Brimson, who is a newcomer to Wane's squad added: \"In my opinion, he was the best centre [in the NRL] this year. \"He has been the Dally M centre the last two years and missed out this year by a smidge and I thought this was his best year at centre. He's in fine form and is someone I am looking forward to playing with.\"The 25-year-old's rise to prominence is well documented.  Once on the books of Manchester United, he was courted by Burnley and Manchester City as a promising young footballer.Instead he devoted himself to rugby league and under the tutelage of his uncle, the former Wigan scout Brian Foley, he excelled as a junior for Wigan St Patricks before leaving his Lancashire home, aged 17, to pursue his dream 10,000 miles away.Signed by Brisbane Broncos, he made his NRL debut in 2019, and was a part of the team who reached the 2023 Grand Final before switching to their local rivals the Dolphins - the NRL's 17th franchise - for 2024.Despite carrying a status to rival England's star-studded opponents and being the man many believe will illuminate the series, he remains modest and in touch with his roots. \"I keep trying to get better each year and I like to think I've done that over the time I've had in the NRL and it is just the same in this camp too,\" Farnworth said.\"I am going to learn a lot from the boys in Super League. We have some great footballers. We've got a really strong bond as a team and we're planning on doing something special.\"I play against them [Australia's players] week in and week out and they are very talented players, but they are just men. There is  nothing superhuman about them. I love playing the Aussies and am keen to get stuck into them at Wembley.\"Farnworth's remit this time around has also included looking after Brimson, who switched his international allegiance from Australia to England in May. The full-back's two brothers were born in Chertsey and he has often visited England's south coast for family holidays, with his mum hailing from London. And so Farnworth joked that he wanted to show him a little bit of northern culture.\"I took AJ to Greggs. We were walking around Manchester city centre and he was a bit hungry so I thought I'd show him a bit of culture,\" said Farnworth.With England based just outside Manchester for most of the three-Test series, Farnworth has been able to enjoy home comforts. \"I've been up Pendle Hill. It's a boost to see all my family and friends again because I don't get to see them too often,\" Farnworth said.\"When I do, it is very special and having them watch me play is a rare occasion, so it makes it even better for me. \"They will be coming to all three games. Whenever I go home it feels like I have not left. It's a very close-knit village and everyone knows me and the family.\"But his friends have called him out over a slight Queensland twang to his accent.\"You pick up the twang [in Australia],\" he said. \"It's the little slang words I have lost from over here but once I'm around the English boys, it comes back pretty quick. In Australia, I get slated for being English, then when I come back home, my mates slag me for being an Aussie. I can't win.\"With a record crowd for an Ashes Test of about 60,000 expected at Wembley on Saturday, the magnitude of the occasion - a first Test series against Australia since 2003 - is not lost on Farnworth.\"I might not get to play in one again. If it is every 20 years, it makes it very, very special. It is everything,\" he added.\"I have got a lot of bets riding on it with team-mates at the Dolphins, so I am going to be poor if I go back and we have lost.\"",

    "body": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jude Bellingham scored his first goal of the season on Wednesday ByElizabeth ConwaySpanish football reporterJude Bellingham is already a hero among Real Madrid fans.The 22-year-old midfielder has had a difficult start to the campaign after injury and growing questions around his place in England's World Cup squad.But, as he prepares for Sunday's El Clasico against Barcelona, the former Birmingham City man will be determined to prove to everyone - including Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel - he is still England's leading man in La Liga.It is set to be the first El Clasico to feature two English players in opposition, with Barcelona's in-form forward Marcus Rashford set to face Bellingham.The involvement of a third - Real full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold - is unlikely because of injury, as Madrid look to stretch their two-point lead at the top  over their bitter rivals.For Bellingham, an El Clasico provides the perfect stage to make a statement.The defining fixture of Spanish football, there will be more than 80,000 fans packed inside the Bernabeu - the majority being passionate Madridistas. And Bellingham will know Tuchel's eyes and the eyes of more than 650 million viewers will also be on him.Perfect occasion to earn England recallSince joining Real Madrid from Borussia Dortmund in 2023, Bellingham has won pretty much everything at club level - including La Liga and the Champions League.And his standout performances haven't been limited to club football - his overhead kick in stoppage time against Slovakia at last year's Euros was just one example of him rising to the occasion for his country. With 44 international caps, he has experience of three major tournaments, was part of the leadership group in the camp, and voted England men's player of the year for 2024-25 by supporters.Yet Bellingham was left out Tuchel's squad for their wins over Wales and Latvia earlier in October.The England manager insisted there was no personal issue between them, stressing the decision was purely about maintaining the core of the squad that had performed well during the September fixtures against Andorra and Serbia.Tuchel said he will speak to Bellingham before the next camp in November - and it already seems inevitable the biggest story around that squad selection will be whether he gets recalled.Bellingham has the perfect occasion to prove his worth when defending champions Barcelona visit.'Nothing to prove to anyone but himself'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Bellingham described scoring the winner against Juventus as 'unbelievable'Bellingham's start to the season was inevitably difficult, having had shoulder surgery in July for a long-standing injury he sustained in 2023.He missed 63 days of training and playing, including five matches for Los Blancos.In his first appearance back in late September, he was welcomed to the pitch with a huge roar as his return thrilled the Madridistas. \"Bellingham has nothing to prove on Sunday,\" said Real supporter Carlos Campillo. \"He already does that with every game he plays in and every assist he makes. He doesn't have to prove anything to anyone but himself.Fellow fan Juan Antonio Lillo added: \"It's not a decisive game for him. He needs to keep picking up pace and getting a feel for the game. It's just one more step towards reaching the level he needs to be at and he'll get there sooner or later.\"Since Bellingham's return, he has appeared in six more fixtures in all competitions, slowly increasing his minutes and trying to rediscover his best form.For much of that stretch, however, his influence was limited - until this week, where his match-winning goal in the Champions League against Juventus reignited the Bernabeu's belief - and perhaps his too.\"It's a great feeling, a long time now since I've scored, a lot of time out and dreaming of that moment, back in the Champions League and against a big team\", Bellingham told US broadcaster CBS after scoring his first goal of the season.\"To score a winner here at home, it's unbelievable. I felt comfortable, really good. To play well was important, and to score the winning goal helps the team a lot.\"Bellingham shone in his debut season at the Bernabeu, scoring 19 goals in La Liga, but his form dipped slightly in 2024–25 as Madrid finished the campaign without a major trophy.\"I didn't think last year was a disaster,\" he reflected. \"[It was] still 15 goals, 14 assists, but I know the general feeling was that it was worse. But I was a part of that, how we didn't play as well last year.\"There were still good moments, but not the level I want to play at, not the level like the first year. Now I've had my shoulder surgery, a new manager, he's got that shape, how we want to play.\"Time for more heroics against Barcelona?Rashford, also bidding to earn a World Cup slot with England while on loan from Manchester United, will be experiencing an El Clasico for the first time, but Bellingham is an old hand.\"It's like playing in a final - a victory in El Clasico feels like that,\" Campillo said. In his four El Clasico appearances, Bellingham has scored three times - two in his first and once in his second.He became the first Real player to score in his first two La Liga Clasicos since Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2007 - a feat that quickly etched his name into the club's history books.To date, he has played the full match in every fixture.What better time than to work his magic against Barcelona once more?'Recovery key to a better Real Madrid'ByBBC Sport ColumnistJude Bellingham's international break came at the right time. Xabi Alonso was happy to have him around, not only to help him regain full fitness but also to speak face to face about his role.The manager sees Bellingham as a hybrid - part midfielder, part forward - operating just behind Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe. But Alonso's aim now is to recover the first version of Bellingham - the one who arrived in the box with perfect timing and scored freely.Last season, the Englishman's role expanded so much that he was everywhere - and in the end, less effective. Alonso's message has been clear - do less to be more. The statistics support that rethink - with Vinicius, Mbappe and Bellingham all starting, the team failed to win 17 of their 30 matches. There was not enough defending from the front, not enough harmony in attackAfter the heavy 5-2 defeat by Atletico Madrid in September, Bellingham was left on the bench against Kairat Almaty and Villarreal. But following the international break, he returned to the starting line-up against Getafe and is expected to start against Barcelona. Alongside Arda Guler, he will be central to giving the team greater fluidity and attacking threat. He is still not at his best, but recovering it is seen as key to a better Real Madrid.",

    "body": "5 days agoMegan BonarBBC ScotlandPA MediaThe US talk show host was invited to dinner by members of the Royal Regiment of ScotlandA kilt might not be the first thing on your list when you're a TV superstar packing for an autumnal holiday in Scotland.But that's exactly what American comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon was left scrambling for when he was unexpectedly invited to a black-tie dinner while on a trip to Aberdeenshire.Luckily, his hotel's night manager was on hand to give him a loan of his own kilt.The comedian was welcomed to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater by officers from the 5Scots regiment who served him Scotch eggs and Buckfast.Fallon rose to fame as a cast member on the comedy sketch series Saturday Night Live before becoming the host of a late-night talk show.PA MediaJimmy dined on Scotch eggs and Buckfast tonic wineSpeaking about his trip, in a video shared on TikTok, Fallon said he travelled to Scotland to take a trip on the Royal Scotsman when he had a chance encounter with some soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland.The comedian was visiting the River Dee near Balmoral Castle when some members of the King's royal guards, the 5Scots battalion, recognised him and invited him to the Victoria Barracks in Ballater for dinner.The invitation, along with its black-tie dress code, left him with a dilemma - where to get a suit or a kilt, at such short notice.He approached staff at the Fife Arms where he was staying who went the extra mile to help their guest.Fallon said: \"I called the night manager and I talked to him. I said 'I need to get a kilt tonight' and he goes 'I'll figure something out', so Muir gave me his own kilt.\"The manager pieced together a full ensemble of kilt, jacket, sporran, hose and brogues.Scotch egg and BuckfastThe SNL actor said his hosts were \"psyched\" he wore a kilt and he \"had the best dinner ever\".He dined on venison Scotch egg washed down with Buckfast tonic wine, which Fallon said had left him feeling a bit worse for wear.He left the evening with his very own kilt, fitted by the battalion's tailor and a Glengarry hat he proudly wore during the video.Major Thomas Blair, commanding officer of 5Scots, said: \"What started as a chance meeting near Balmoral turned into a brilliant evening.\"It's not every day you get to meet a Hollywood A-lister, and we were delighted to welcome him to Scotland - in true Scots style.\"Within 5Scots, Balaklava company has a number of ceremonial roles in Scotland and forms the royal guard at Balmoral.The infantry company welcomed the King to Balmoral when he arrived for his summer residence earlier this year.",

    "body": "Venezuela's Maduro says US 'fabricating war' as it deploys world's largest warship6 hours agoKayla Epstein and Josh Cheetham,BBC VerifyThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, can carry up to 90 aircraftVenezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of \"fabricating a new war\", after it ordered the world's largest warship to be sent to the Caribbean.The USS Gerald R Ford can carry up to 90 aircraft and its deployment marks a massive increase in US firepower in the region.The US has conducted 10 air strikes on vessels in the area as part of what it says is a war on drug traffickers. US President Donald Trump has accused Maduro of being the leader of a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies, and there are fears in Venezuela that the US military build-up is aimed at removing the long-time opponent of Trump from power. The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair. Opposition tallies from polling stations showed its candidate had won by a landslide.Venezuela plays a relatively minor role in the region's drug trade.What's Trump's endgame in Venezuela?The Pentagon said on Friday that the USS Gerald R Ford carrier would deploy to the US Southern Command area of responsibility, which includes Central America and South America, as well as the Caribbean. The additional forces \"will enhance and augment existing capabilities to disrupt narcotics trafficking and degrade and dismantle transnational criminal organisations\", spokesman Sean Parnell said.Maduro accused the US of seeking \"a new eternal war\" in his address.\"They promised they would never again get involved in a war, and they are fabricating a war,\" he told state media.The carrier's deployment would provide the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground. Trump has repeatedly raised the possibility of what he called \"land action\" in Venezuela.\"We are certainly looking at land now, because we've got the sea very well under control,\" he said earlier this week.The US has also bolstered its air presence in the region. BBC Verify has identified a number of US military aircraft across Puerto Rico.It comes as CNN reports Trump is considering targeting cocaine facilities and drug trafficking routes inside Venezuela, but is yet to make a final decision.Military analysts have pointed out that intercepting drugs at sea does not require a force as big as the current US one.Watch: The US is \"fabricating an eternal war\", says Nicolás MaduroOn Friday, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said \"six male narco-terrorists\" had been killed in an operation in the Caribbean.He said the boat had belonged to the Tren de Aragua - a transnational criminal organisation which has its base in Venezuela and has been proscribed as a terrorist group by the US State Department.The US air strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. \"This is about regime change. They're probably not going to invade, the hope is this is about signalling,\" Dr Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Chatham House think tank, told the BBC.He argued the military build-up was intended to \"strike fear\" into the hearts of the Venezuelan military and Maduro's inner circle so that they move against him.Pete Hegseth on XThe US said it had destroyed a drug trafficking boat earlier on FridayThe strike was the latest the Trump administration has carried out against alleged drug traffickers since early September. Most have taken place off the coast of South America, in the Caribbean, but on 21 and 22 October it carried out strikes in the Pacific Ocean as well.At least 43 people have been killed.Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have raised concerns about the legality of the strikes and the president's authority to order them.On 10 September, 25 Democratic senators wrote to the White House, alleging the administration had struck a vessel days earlier \"without evidence that the individuals on the vessel and the vessel's cargo posed a threat to the United States\".Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Republican, has argued that such strikes require congressional approval. Trump has said he has the legal authority to order the strikes.\"We're allowed to do that, and if we do [it] by land, we may go back to Congress,\" Trump told White House reporters on Wednesday.Brian Finucane, a former US State Department lawyer, told the BBC that the situation amounted to a constitutional crisis that the US Congress, controlled by Republicans, has appeared unwilling to challenge. \"It is the US Congress that has principal control over the use of military force. That control has been usurped in this instance by the White House, and so it's up to Congress to push back,\" said Mr Finucane, who now works at the International Crisis Group.  ",

    "body": "13 hours agoRuth CleggHealth and wellbeing reporterGetty ImagesIt's been described as the mineral of the moment.Millions of us are taking magnesium for a whole range of reasons. Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.And the industry is booming. The global magnesium market is worth nearly £3bn and that's set to nearly double over the next decade.In a small factory, nestled in the Yorkshire Dales, huge plastic barrels of white powder are stacked up next to giant whirring machines.Workers in hazmat suits carefully weigh out magnesium citrate - a compound made by mixing the mineral with citric acid - into shiny, steel containers.Ruth Clegg/BBCMillions of magnesium tablets are produced in this factory every day\"We are sending our supplies all over the world,\" Andrew Goring, manager director of Lonsdale Health, explains. \"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.\"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing.\"He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.\"Do we actually need it?\" I bellow back. \"And why now, why has it become so popular?\"\"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it,\" Mr Goring explains. \"We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream.\"I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.\"Clever marketing schemes,\" Ms Jackson says, \"magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health.\"But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. The recommended daily amount for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.It might make up less than 1% of us but \"it is involved in over 300 different processes\", Ms Jackson explains.It is \"especially important for our brain and mood,\" she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.Katie CurranKatie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughtsFor Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.\"A year ago, I was struggling,\" she confides. \"It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later.\"Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, an amino acid with limited evidence linking it to better sleep.After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.\"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle.\"While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with \"commission paid\" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation. The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.\"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die',\" Ms Stavridis says, \"'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.\"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium,\" she continues, \"around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the recommended daily intake.\"But just taking a supplement is not the answer.\"Getty ImagesSeeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesiumTake sleep health, for example. Ms Stavridis says there are many conflicting studies on whether magnesium supplements really make a difference. Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also affect the absorption rate of magnesium.Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of \"take this\" and you'll be fixed.She recommends looking at diet first. But if you are thinking about taking magnesium supplements, Ms Stavridis advises taking half the amount recommended on the packet on a daily basis and seeing how you feel.If healthy people take too much, their kidneys can get rid of it in \"expensive urine\", but there are still risks, like diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea.For those with kidney disease, taking magnesium supplements can be dangerous and can cause hypermagnesemia - a potentially life-threatening condition that can leave someone with paralysis or in a coma.Dietitian Kirsten Jackson also says most people should \"100% look at diet first\".Foods like seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are good sources of magnesium, she says.She warns that if you don't regularly consume these types of foods, you're probably also short of other essential nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin K, fibre and prebiotics too.\"One magnesium supplement is not going to sort all that.\"More weekend picks",

    "body": "'I just love yapping': Spud sellers, posh-girl comedy and bus-loving gran among  TikTok award nominees13 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC NewsSarelSarel is best known for her Love Island debriefs after each episode When Sarel presses record on her phone, there's no script, no set and no meticulous plan for what she's about to say. \"I'm usually wearing my bonnet, no makeup and I just pick up the phone and start yapping,\" she says. \"I believe in maximum output for minimal effort, so if I have to do more than the bare minimum, I likely won't do it. That's why I just talk to the camera and post.\" In only a few years, Sarel's unfiltered style has turned her from an ordinary voice online into one of TikTok's most distinctive personalities, with more than one million followers on the platform. Famous for her Love Island debriefs, Sarel is among the nominees at the second annual TikTok awards - a celebration of the creators shaping online culture in the UK. There are 72 nominees across 12 categories including education, beauty, comedy, food and sport. The nominees have a combined following of more than 83 million followers.From breakout comedians to beauty innovators, this year's nominees include jacket potato entrepreneurs, tap dancing brothers, a bus loving aunty, a BookTok aficionado and a film location fangirl. Sarel Sarel can't quite believe that the thing she does most naturally - talking - has gained her millions of followers and likes.\"It's mad people want to watch me yap,\" she says. But the simplicity of her process is part of the appeal and \"you really do see 100% of me on the camera\". Her journey has also taken her beyond the screen, and in 2023 she performed at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with fellow TikTok stars. \"I've got a whole new respect for comedians after doing that,\" she says. \"With content, if people don't like it, they scroll away, but if you bomb on stage, the whole room is looking at you like, 'That's terrible'\".With visibility comes scrutiny, and Sarel says it's not always easy dealing with the darker side of social media. \"The hate is always louder than the love,\" she says. \"Five years ago, I'd clap back in the comments, but I'm 31 now and I'm too tired for that so I just block it out and ignore it.\" Because she started sharing later in life, Sarel is still figuring out how much of herself to put online. \"I go off how I feel in the moment, and my audience respects that,\" she says. \"I started off like I was just talking to friends, but now I protect parts of my life I don't want everyone's opinion on.\" While social media is full of people turning major life events into months-long content strategies, Sarel isn't interested in that and even significant milestones tend to pass with little fanfare on her feed. \"I recently got married and I did two videos, then I was like, 'Let's talk about The Traitors.' I've got ADHD, so I move on quickly.\"Henry RowleyHenry RowleyThe 27-year-old was a marketing executive before finding fame on TikTokBest known for his \"husky posh girl\" sketches, Henry Rowley has become one of TikTok's sharpest comedy voices. The Leicester-born performer discovered his now signature characters while studying at Bristol University, where he found himself \"surrounded by a whole new world of posh\" and he couldn't resist turning it into material.\"Some of those posh people were my friends and I found everything they said hilarious, so I started making videos about things they'd say on nights out.\"His sketches, which more recently include impressions of Harry Potter characters as if they were Scottish, has earned him more than a million followers on TikTok. He's also tried to carve a space in stand-up - a move he admits has been challenging. \"It's entirely different doing content and comedy on stage,\" he says. \"Stand-up takes a lot of work and before the Fringe and my tour, there were so many pubs and awful gigs where I did a 20-minute set to zero laughs. It's certainly humbling.\" Despite his rising profile, Rowley protects much of his life from the public eye. \"I mainly post characters and sketches so people who follow me don't know that much about me, which is really nice. I like having that balance,\" he says. His advice for other people starting out creating content is similar to what most of the nominees said: \"Don't try and go viral but instead focus on doing something you are genuinely interested in.\" Bemi OrojuogunBemi, known as Bus Aunty, is nominated for best video of the year which has been watched 49 million timesIf London has an unofficial ambassador for its buses, it might just be Bus Aunty. Often seen smiling beside a passing double-decker, she's turned her lifelong love of the capital's transport network into a viral celebration of city life.\"My love for buses comes from a long time ago, from the early 90s,\" she says. \"I have always taken a picture of myself with buses and one random day I chose to post one on TikTok and it went viral, and now here we are.\" One of her videos, which is nominated for best video of the year, has been viewed amost 50 million times and Bemi now has collaborations with Burberry and Ikea. The mental health nurse has become one of TikTok's most unexpected success stories and she admits \"it's slightly overwhelming that everyone recognises me\".\"I get recognised in the streets sometimes and people say, 'Oh, hello, Bus Aunty.' I never thought people would be stopping me in my wildest dreams and it's taken some getting used to.\" \"To be nominated is amazing,\" she says of her TikTok Awards nod. \"If I'm nominated, it means I deserve to be here, and I really do love buses and love London and hopefully that shows.\" She's also proud to represent a different side of the app's community. \"You're never too old,\" she says firmly. \"I would never have thought I could do TikTok and be nominated for awards, but here I am, having only posted for just over a year.\"Never give up on your dream because what I love about London has got me here.\"Jack Edwards Jack EdwardsIf TikTok has a resident librarian, it's Jack Edwards, who has built a devoted following by sharing his love of reading. But he says his journey into social media stardom began with rejection.\"It was lockdown and I was looking for a job in publishing and no-one wanted to hire me,\" he recalls. \"My inbox was snorkelling in a sea of rejection and every email started with the word unfortunately.\"So I started talking about the books I was reading on social media.\"What began as a side project quickly turned into a full-time career, and Edwards ended up leaving the job he'd eventually secured in publishing. He says his advice to would-be creators is finding what makes their content personal.\"You have so many interests,\" he explains. \"If you were to create a Venn diagram of them all, the crossover in the middle is what you should make content about. For me, the cross-section is books, travel and pop culture.\"Edwards adds that he's careful about how much of himself he reveals to his audience. \"I talk about the books and art I love, but never the people I love,\" he says. \"But of course when you talk about books, you end up talking about everything from trauma, to politics, to sexuality.\"That openness has seen him create a community that stretches far beyond the screen.\"People say, 'Hi' in the street and it's the best thing ever. We have a mini book club right there on the pavement, an instant Jane Austen love-fest, and I know it's so strange but honestly it's really special for me.\"Still, internet fame brings its odd moments. \"Sometimes you get a message saying, 'Oh, hi, I just saw you at the urinal,'\" he laughs. \"Being spotted in those kinds of places never gets normal.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoSam FrancisPolitical reporterPA MediaLucy Powell has been elected as Labour's new deputy leader after a race triggered by Angela Rayner's resignation last month.The Manchester Central MP defeated Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson by promising to give grassroots members a louder voice and push for a \"course correction\" in government.She was sacked from the cabinet in September and drew support from members who are dissatisfied with the direction of the government under Sir Keir Starmer's leadership. Powell took 87,407 votes, nearly 14,000 votes ahead of Phillipson, on a turnout of 16.6%.During her victory speech she said the party needed to be \"bolder\" and promised to be a \"champion for our Labour values\".She said she would \"help Keir and our government to succeed\" but said the party \"must change how we are doing things to turn things around\".Powell said she would use her role to \"bring voices\" who believe the government is not being bold enough \"to the heart of our party\".\"I'll be a champion for our Labour values and boldness in everything we do, and I know that you Keir, as our leader, want that - and I will be your ally in that fight,\" she said.Powell also singled out Reform UK, saying it \"starts with us wrestling back the political megaphone and setting the agenda more strongly, because let's be honest we've let [Nigel] Farage and his ilk run away with it\".She said the party could not win support by \"trying to 'out-Reform' Reform\".PA MediaPowell's victory comes after a week in which the government has faced questions over the grooming gangs inquiry and the mistaken release of a migrant sex offender from prison.It also saw Labour beaten in a Senedd by-election in Caerphilly, a seat the party had held for a century.The prime minister said he accepted the party had suffered a \"bad result\" in Wales, describing it as a \"reminder that people need to look out their window and see change and renewal in their community, opportunities for their children, public services rebuilt, the cost of living crisis tackled\".Labour must now \"unite\" and \"keep our focus on what is, in my view, the defining battle for the soul of our nation\", he added.Phillipson congratulated Powell on her victory in a statement, though said she was \"obviously disappointed at today's result\".She said it was \"crucial that our party now comes together to take the fight to Reform in next year's crucial Senedd, Holyrood and local elections\".The race to be Labour deputy leader began with six candidates but the field was quickly reduced to two, with Phillipson widely seen as the leadership's preferred candidate.The education secretary gained an early lead when the election campaign first got under way, securing more MPs and union endorsements, but Powell gained ground by winning support from constituency parties.She was endorsed by figures who have been publicly critical of the Labour leadership, like Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham.Powell and Phillipson served in cabinet together and are seen as being close politically - but while the race was largely collegiate, it erupted at points into accusations of \"mud-slinging\" and sexist briefings.Hustings at Labour's conference highlighted a divide in approach: Phillipson warned against \"division and disunity\", while Powell insisted Labour leaders needed to listen to a wider range of voices to avoid political missteps.In June, the government was forced into a U-turn over cuts to welfare spending, which Powell blamed on the failure of Starmer's team to listen to MPs.During the campaign, Powell frequently referred to \"mistakes\" made by the party on issues such as the winter fuel allowance.PA MediaThe election was triggered by Rayner's dramatic resignation after admitting to underpaying tax on a house purchase.While relations between Sir Keir and Rayner had been tense at times, she was seen as a key figure in government. She held the title deputy prime minister and was seen as a political bridge between the leadership and the party's traditional working class and union base.But last month's reshuffle left the deputy leadership as a purely party role after Sir Keir appointed David Lammy as deputy prime minister and placed key allies in other cabinet roles.However, Powell will sit on Labour's powerful National Executive Committee and act as the party's \"campaigner-in-chief.\" Previous holders of the role have sought to unite the party's factions but differences of opinion with leaders have also led to divisions. Under Sir Tony Blair, John Prescott became a link to Labour's party faithful and the pair had a close relationship - while Tom Watson, on the other hand, clashed with Jeremy Corbyn.Whether Powell's election strengthens Labour's campaign machine or deepens internal strains could shape the party's fortunes over a critical few months for the party.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is weeks away from delivering a much-anticipated Budget, where she is expected to raise taxes.The party is also only six months away from a difficult set of council elections in England and assembly elections in Scotland and Wales, where Powell will play a key role in rallying activists.",

Powell grew up in Didsbury, Manchester, an area which has been variously dubbed the \"stockbroker\" or \"muesli\" belt following a few years of gentrification. \"It is posh now, it was not that posh then,\" she has said.Of the 200 people at her sixth form, she says she was the only one to be accepted to Oxford University - not an achievement that made her happy at the time. \"I cried the day I got the offer,\" she says. \"I didn't want to go.\"In the end, she did go to Oxford to study chemistry but only lasted one year before heading to King's College London, where she said she \"felt more comfortable\". \"As a northern comprehensive girl arriving in Oxford in 1993, I was a duck out of water.\" \"Harry Potter had not been written then, but it was like Hogwarts,\" she told the i newspaper, adding that for a teenager who spent weekends clubbing at the Hacienda, the \"stuffy environment\" of Oxford's Somerville College did not suit her. After leaving university, she embarked on her political career, going to work for Labour MP (and Oscar-winning actress) Glenda Jackson and later Beverley Hughes, another Labour MP.  Between 1998 and 2005, she worked for Britain in Europe, a group campaigning in favour of the UK's membership of the EU. In 2010, she ran Ed Miliband's successful bid to lead the Labour Party and continued working for him as his deputy chief of staff until 2012, when she won a by-election to represent the safe Labour seat of Manchester Central. A year later she was promoted to the shadow cabinet and continued to serve in different frontbench roles until 2016.She had been one of a few party centrists to stay in the shadow cabinet when Jeremy Corbyn, who came from the left of the party, unexpectedly became Labour leader.However, in 2016 she quit in protest at his leadership and backed an ultimately unsuccessful coup attempt by Owen Smith.She only returned to the shadow cabinet in 2020, when Sir Keir Starmer took over as leader and appointed her as shadow housing secretary.When Labour won the 2024 election, she became Leader of the House of Commons, whose main job is managing government business in Parliament, as well as modernising Parliament and improving working conditions for MPs and staff.In the major reshuffle that followed Angela Rayner's resignation in September, Powell was one of the few ministers to be sacked from government. She described it as \"kind of a shock but not a total surprise\".Asked if the prime minister gave her a reason for her demotion, she said \"No, I did ask but he just said 'I need to make some changes'.\"Reflecting on the possible reason, she said \"I know I am not in the in-crowd. I don't play some of the parlour games\". \"I have fed back things that in hindsight - I thought I was doing the job I was suppose to be doing - but perhaps it was feedback people didn't want to hear.\"\"Some of what I was feeding back - especially how difficult legislation on welfare was going to be to land - I thought I was doing that to be helpful but maybe it was a message people didn't want to hear.\"Ahead of the vote, she said that if she did win the deputy leadership, she did not want to be given a government role, adding that she did not want to be \"constrained\" by a cabinet job. She said she viewed the deputy leader role as being a \"bridge between the leadership and the members, a constant feedback loop\" as well as a \"campaigner-in-chief\". Asked about her vision for Labour, she said her Manchester Central constituency was made up of \"classic Red Wall constituents - white working class, older voters\" and \"younger, liberal, left-leaning voters who haven't got that long-standing cultural loyalty to Labour\".The question for Labour, she said is \"how we unite them together\". \"I don't think tacking one way or tacking the other is how we do that.\"She argued that Labour could achieve that by building a \"fairer economy, an economy that works in the interests of the many, not the few\".Citing decisions to cut the winter fuel payment and welfare, she said: \"Some of the mistakes we have made, some of the unforced errors have given a sense that we are not on the side of ordinary people.\"",

    "body": "13 hours agoEmer MoreauBusiness reporterChancellor Rachel Reeves should not cut the cash Isa tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget, a group of MPs has strongly advised.  Cuts to the tax-free allowance were unlikely to have the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK, the Treasury Select Committee said in a report.Reeves is expected to announce tax rises or spending cuts in next month's Budget, and is reportedly considering changes to cash Isas.The chancellor said: \"My understanding is that the report says that changes to Isas shouldn't be made in isolation of other policies. I'll be setting out any tax changes in the budget in November. And of course we need to get that balance right.\"Reeves added: \"At the moment, often returns on savings and returns on pensions are lower than in comparable countries around the world, and I do want to make sure that when people put something aside for the future, they get good returns on those savings.\"Earlier this year, the chancellor was thought to be mulling a reduction to the allowance for tax-free cash savings in a bid to encourage people to put money into stocks and shares instead and boost the economy.Those plans were put on hold after strong opposition from banks, building societies and consumer campaigners.Savers can put up to £20,000 a year in Isas in savings and investments, to protect the returns from being taxed. The chancellor has said she intends to keep this limit in place, and it can currently  be spread across products including cash Isas and stocks and shares Isas. The proposed change specifically relates to cash Isas, and earlier this month the Financial Times reported the chancellor was considering reducing their tax-free amount to £10,000. The purpose behind this would be to encourage investment. The chancellor is facing a Budget shortfall of about £22bn, according to a recent estimate.She is expected to raise taxes or cut spending in her November Budget in order to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules of not borrowing to fund day-to-day spending and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament.Cash Isas are the most widely used type of Isa. A total of £360bn is held in cash Isas across the country.The committee's report concluded that \"cutting the cash Isa allowance is unlikely to incentivise people to invest their cash in stocks and shares\".Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Dame Meg Hillier, said: \"This is not the right time to cut the cash Isa limit.\"\"The Committee is firmly behind the chancellor's ambition to create a culture in the UK where savers are sensibly investing their money and getting better returns through well-informed financial decisions,\" she said.\"But we are a long way from that point.\"Dame Meg said the government should instead focus its efforts on \"a comprehensive effort to genuinely improve financial education and establish accessible, high quality financial advice and guidance for people\".\"Without this, I fear that the Chancellor's attempts to transform the UK's investment culture simply will not deliver the change she seeks, instead hitting savers and mortgage borrowers.\"Reducing the tax-free allowance for cash Isas would likely be unpopular among many savers, particularly older ones who are less willing to take risks with their money.Instead of cutting the cash Isa tax-free limit, \"the focus should be on improving financial literacy ... so that people can make informed decisions with their savings\", the committee said.The report found that cutting the allowance would have negative knock-on effects for consumers, as building societies depend on cash Isas for their mortgage lending.\"If this was reduced, it would mean a less competitive market for financial products and consequently higher prices for consumers,\" the committee said.BBC News has contacted the Treasury for comment.",

    "body": "22 minutes agoLaura KuenssbergPresenter, Sunday with Laura KuenssbergKamala Harris says she still sees herself as having a political future and may run for the White House in 2028Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House.In her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.Making her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.As the Democratic party searches for answers about Republican Donald Trump's decisive victory one year ago, much of the blame has been directed at former President Joe Biden for not standing down sooner.But there have also been questions raised about whether Harris could have run a better campaign and set out a clearer message on the number one issue, the economy.In the BBC interview Harris entertained the prospect of another run at the White House, saying her grandnieces would, \"in their lifetime, for sure\", see a female president. Asked if it would be her, she said, \"possibly\", confirming she is considering another run at the top job.Harris said she had not yet made a decision, but underlined that she still sees herself as having a future in politics.\"I am not done,\" the former vice-president said. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it's in my bones.\"Responding to odds that place her as an outsider to win a place on the Democratic ticket - even behind Hollywood actor Dwayne the Rock Johnson - she said she never listened to polls.\"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\"Harris also said she believed predictions she made about Donald Trump behaving as a fascist and running an authoritarian government had come true.\"He said he would weaponise the Department of Justice - and he has done exactly that.\"She pointed to the suspension of late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel by ABC after he made a joke about Republican reaction to the death of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk.His removal from the airwaves, celebrated by Trump, came after the Trump-appointed regulator threatened Kimmel's broadcasters.\"You look at what has happened in terms of how he has weaponised, for example, federal agencies going around after political satirists… His skin is so thin he couldn't endure criticism from a joke, and attempted to shut down an entire media organisation in the process.\"Harris also slammed business leaders and institutions in America who have, in her view, too easily bowed to the president's demands.\"There are many… that have capitulated since day one, who are bending the knee at the foot of a tyrant, I believe for many reasons, including they want to be next to power, because they want to perhaps have a merger approved or avoid an investigation.\"The White House was dismissive when asked for a response to Harris's comments about the president.\"When Kamala Harris lost the election in a landslide, she should've taken the hint - the American people don't care about her absurd lies,\" said spokeswoman Abigail Jackson. \"Or maybe she did take the hint and that's why she's continuing to air her grievances to foreign publications.\"Harris has just published her account of her rollercoaster campaign, 107 Days, the time that was left to her to run for the presidency after Biden withdrew from the race following months of speculation about his mental acuity.In our full interview with the former vice-president, to be broadcast in the UK on Sunday at 09:00 GMT (05:00 EST), I pressed Harris several times on whether she ought to have urged Biden to make way for her sooner. How much did she really know about his health? And a question that may haunt her - whether she would be president now, not Donald Trump, if Biden had withdrawn earlier?The answer is plainly, unknowable - the great \"if\" that could have changed the fate of America. Among the Democratic soul-searching, Harris' candidacy is often disparaged, her weaknesses as a leader pinpointed as the reasons for her defeat, not just the last-minute nature of Biden's decision. When questioned about what went wrong, rather than plunge into deep analysis, her contention is because she started so late, it was almost impossible to win. Why Kamala Harris lost: A flawed candidate or doomed campaign?But having sat down with the Californian former prosecutor in the gilded surroundings of a luxury London hotel - rather than the increasingly golden surroundings of the Oval Office as Donald Trump glitzes up the decor - the possibility of power is something she is not willing to leave behind.Previous hints of her future presidential ambition seemed coy, non-committal - \"maybe, maybe not\", or \"I'm not focusing on that right now\". Her candour in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.That may be surprising given the thoroughly bruising nature of a defeat she has described as traumatising. She and her team were devastated by the defeat, which came as a surprise to them.\"My god, my god, what will happen to our country?\" Harris says she repeated when the result came through.Her attempt to explain it focuses on how narrow the gap in actual votes was between her and Trump. The popular vote was, indeed, very tight, with less than 2% in it. However, Harris was trounced by Trump in the all-important electoral college, where each state has a certain number of votes that tally up.What is the US electoral college, and how does it work?Harris was willing to drop heavy hints about her own future. But there's less willingness from her, or frankly any other senior Democrats, grappling with their party's long-term dilemmas. How does a centre-left party with mainstream leaders take on a right-wing populist leader? Is the answer to focus on Trump? Or is it to argue more forcefully for Main Street?  When I challenged the former vice-president on why her campaign did not better connect with working people, she said she needed more time to do that, and pointed to a longstanding drift away from her party among that group.She regrets she didn't have long enough in 2024 to make her own pitch on bread- and-butter issues like housing, or childcare. But if she had longer next time round, it's far from guaranteed her arguments would be more compelling, or more gladly received.Kamala Harris still travels with the trappings of an entourage. Aides anxiously watch the clock as her every minute is planned with military precision. Non-stop travel, choreographed events in different capitals, a tiny number of carefully planned TV interviews. This time, Harris is on the move for a book tour, not a presidential race. But maybe, if she has her way, this is the start of another campaign after all.Pictures: Jeff Overs/BBC",
